		<English>[H1]Blizzards[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]Blizzards in normal Fall from Heaven 2 are features that appear after the Deepening ritual is completed. They do nothing, other then turn plots directly below them to taiga or tundra when the Call Blizzard spell is cast, which is incidentally the only way to move them.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the Blizzards mod, however, Blizzards are randomly spawned in any ice plot under Frozen or Illian control. Blizzards can move around, spreading ice terrain and terraforming all plots directly around them, turning them to colder terrain, and on water, can create ice features. They don't last indefinitely however, and disappear as they move around the map.[PARAGRAPH:1]Here is a detailed list of what happens to features and terrains that blizzards pass by:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Taiga Terrain: Become permanent tundra terrain.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Other Land Terrains: Become tundra terrain, either temporary or permanent.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET] Removed Features/Improvements: Flames, Flood Plains, Scrubs and Smoke.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Converted Features: Forests and Jungles become snow-covered forests.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Water Plots: An ice feature has a chance of being created on the plot.[PARAGRAPH:2]To help balance these changes, specifically those related to water ice, the [LINK=SPELL_SCORCH]Scorch[\LINK] spell can now remove water ice from within a 1-plot radius of the caster.</English>
