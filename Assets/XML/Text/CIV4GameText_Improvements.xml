From this, a trickle of commerce follows the wagons laden with ore. It's not much but give it time...</English>

Spiraling out from the main shaft, a network of living spaces, markets and workshops is hewn while the excess stone is used to build the walls ever higher.

Finalement, le grand technoprêtre Alset découvrit qu'il était possible d'insuffler à certains cristaux un équivalent de la mana à partir des N&#156;uds, à condition que ces N&#156;uds soient correctement "excités" par une combianison d'énergie solaire et de pulsations tonales rythmiques. Ces cristaux pouvaient être utilisés par la suite comme batteries pour alimenter la plupart des merveilleux appareils des Mechanos. Cependant le prix à payer fut terrible : la mort lente et douloureuse de milliers d'ouvriers Mechanos avant la découverte des radiations nocives générées lors du processus.</French>

		<English>Castle comes from the Bannor word "castilum" meaning "fortress". This is a diminutive of the word "castre", which means "fortified place". Castles were always something more, than just "fortified places" or "fortresses". This word originates back into the dark times of Age of Ice, when all of the Bannor settlements were fortified. People started to use a separate word for a cultural centre, where local administration resided. These places also became an army concentration centres and big training yards, where the most powerful Bannor units - the paladins, were trained. Back in those days people started to use a shortened form of "castilum", a "castil" and in the end, by binding this with a hard ending of a word "castre", a word castle appeared. Some are also trying to find a connection to a word "astlum", which means a strategic location, but these are yet not confirmed. The problem is, that Bannor language has twenty different meanings for a strategic location. I, by myself however do not exlude this possibility, because indeed castles as such were built in strategic locations.</English>

Back in those days people started to use a shortened form of "castilum", a "castil" and in the end, by binding this with a hard ending of a word "castre", a word castle appeared. Some are also trying to find a connection to a word "astlum", which means a strategic location, but these are yet not confirmed. The problem is, that Bannor language has twenty different meanings for a strategic location. I, by myself however do not exlude this possibility, because indeed castles as such were built in strategic locations.</Spanish>

		<English>A citadel is a fortress protecting a town, sometimes incorporating a castle. The term derives from the same root as the word city, "civis", meaning citizen. Citadels are the last line of defense of a city - when the walls are breached and most of the town overrun by enemy, city inhabitants and defenders that survived the fall of the other defenses can make their last stand here. On the other hand, citadels are often used to protect a garrison or political power from the inhabitants of the town it is defending (or occuping). Part of their design is to ensure loyalty from the town which they defended.</English>

		<English>Ever heard of the battle of Nura Diatel? It was a big city, under siege for three days by the Amurites, who were trying to capture it. They just couldn't get through these huge walls around the city. On the first day they got this fire mage to try and get the soldiers who were on it so they could climb the wall with ladders. He killed about twenty soldiers with fire balls before he was shot in the head with an arrow from one of the enemy archers. Next, they sent out an entropy mage who started decaying the soldiers standing on the wall. Five died, and thirty were crippled before he got shot in the chest with a half dozen arrows. On the third day of the siege they sent out this force mage. He's about to cast a spell, when an archer pops out from the enemy ramparts. He fires an arrow, but the force mage reverses it in mid air and it collides with the wall with the power of a hundred-something battering rams, killing everyone on or near the entire east wall and crushing the houses beneath it. The rubble traveled so far it collided with the keep in the center of the city where the governor was hiding and leveled that, too. The city was so badly damaged that we ended up razing it since it would have taken too long to rebuild everything. But in the mage's defense, we DID win the battle.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]- Hertal, Mercenary Leader.</English>
