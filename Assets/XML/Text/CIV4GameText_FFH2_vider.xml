		<English>Axes have been used since time immemorial, and not just as tools. When the Gods taught mankind the secret of metal working, the noble art of murdering thy neighbor took a giant leap forward. The battle-axe, preferred weapon of the Dwarves, is a fearsome weapon also in human hands, cleaving flesh and bone with horrific and very final results. Metal battle-axes are expensive and difficult to make, and so they are reserved for the privileged few that make up the professional warrior class, often the personal body-guards of the nobility. These professional warriors are often hardened veterans of countless vendettas and clan wars, which gives them a serious edge in a fight. Frequently ruthless and not very prone to showing mercy, they have been known to completely eradicate less experienced units. Axemen who have fallen into disfavor or been banished often join the ranks of the Barbarian tribes as elite raiders and personal armies of Barbarian chieftains. These coolly efficient killers are often even more terrifying than the disordered warriors that make up the rank-and-file.</English>

		<German>Äxte wurden schon seit uralten Zeiten benutzt und zwar nicht nur als Werkzeuge. Als die Götter der Menschheit die Geheimnisse der Eisenverarbeitung offenbarten, machte die edle Kunst des Ermordens des Nachbarn einen gewaltigen Satz vorwärts. Die Kampfaxt, bevorzugte Waffe der Zwerge, ist eine furchteinflößende Waffe in den Händen der Menschen, die Fleisch und Knochen mit erschreckendem und endgültigem Ergebnis trennt. Metallene Kampfäxte sind teuer und schwer zu fertigen so dass sie nur denen zugänglich sind, die der professionellen Kriegerklasse angehören, meist sind das die Angehörigen der Leibwache der Adligen. Diese erfahrenen Krieger sind meist durch zahllose Blutrachekämpfe und Stammeskriege gestählt, was ihnen einen ernstzunehmenden Vorteil im Kampf verleiht. Meist skrupellos und ohne Hang zur Gnade sind sie dafür bekannt weniger erfahrene Einheiten komplett auszulöschen. Axtkämpfer die in Ungnade gefallen sind oder verbannt wurden schließen sich oft den Reihen der barbarischen Stämme als Elitekämpfer oder Privatsoldaten der barbarischen Häuptlinge an. Diese kühlen und effizienten Mörder sind oft fürchterlicher als die verwilderten Krieger die die Basis ausmachen.</German>

		<English>An artist named Kheldon Ki was called before a wealthy lord and ordered to produce a statue of the lord to stand before his home for all the populace to see and revere. Kheldon Ki was a gifted artist, and all art he created was so lifelike it showed the true soul of its subject. As such, his statue of the lord radiated a sense of ego and vanity to all who looked at it. When the lord saw the completed statue, he ordered it torn down and Kheldon to spend the rest of his life in his deepest dungeons. Kheldon spent 40 years within the dungeon, blind and lonely. To fight his loneliness, he began sculpting people from the rocks in the cavern. By the end of his life, he had created hundreds of these stocky statues of men and woman all doing a variety of tasks. At a great age Kheldon lay upon the floor of the dungeon close to death. It was then that Kilmorph appeared before him and said "You have been imprisoned unjustly, for this I will grant you a wish. Choose your wish carefully though, for you will gain only one, be it for revenge against the lord who imprisoned you or a renewal of youth for you to live again." In this way Kilmorph hoped to test Kheldon, to see if he had become so bitter as to be unworthy of heaven by wishing for revenge against the lord. But Kheldon asked for neither of these two things, and instead said "I wish not revenge for it would gain me nothing, and I wish not new life, for I am ready to die; my only wish is that during my final hours I would not be alone." Kilmorph saw this as a good wish, and granted it by breathing life into all the statues Kheldon had created, and they tended to him until he died. After Kheldon's death, his soul was carried to the underworld on the back of a great dragon, and he was welcomed among the spirits of his ancestors. As for the stone people, they burrowed out of the lord's dungeon and spread through the underdark, becoming the dwarves of today.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bambur is one of the few original dwarves remaining. He was carved by Kheldon and had Kilmorph herself breathe life into him. He is nearly as talented a crafter as his creator, but Bambur makes weapons instead of statues.[PARAGRAPH:1]The first generation of Dwarves never age, they are exactly as they were when they were carved, but each generation of dwarves gets a slightly shorter lifespan. As they get farther and farther from the breath of Kilmorph, they become more mortal, in spirit and life. Bambur has had to watch this fall, the Umberguard himself has even turned away from Kilmorph, but Bambur fights on for his goddess and mother.

		<German>Ein Künstler namens Kheldon Ki wurde zu einem reichen Fürsten gerufen und ihm wurde befohlen eine Statue des Fürsten zu schaffen die vor seinem Heim stehen sollte um vom Pöbel betrachtet und verehrt zu werden. Kheldon Ki war ein begnadeter Künstler und alle Kunst die er schaffte zeigte die wahre Seele seiner Vorbilder. So verstrahlte seine Statue des Fürsten eine Aura seines Egos und seines Stolzes an alle, die sie betrachteten. Als der Fürst die fertiggestellte Statue sah, befahl er sie einzureißen und Kheldon musste den Rest seines Lebens in seinem tiefsten Verlies verbringen. Kheldon, allein und blind, verbrachte 40 Jahre im Verlies. Um seine Einsamkeit zu bekämpfen, begann er damit Menschen aus den Felsen in der Höhle zu formen.Bis zum Ende seines Lebens hatte er hunderte dieser steifen Figuren von Frauen und Männern in den verschiedensten Posen geschaffen. Im hohen Alter lag Kheldon auf dem Boden des Verlieses, er war dem Tode nahe. Dann erschien Kilmorph vor ihm und sprach: "Du wurdest zu Unrecht eingesperrt, deshalb werde ich dir einen Wunsch erfüllen. Doch wähle deinen Wunsch weise, denn ich werde nur einen erfüllen, sei es die Rache am Fürsten der dich einsperrte, oder eine Verjüngung, damit du noch einmal leben kannst. "So hoffte Kilmorph Kheldon testen zu können, um zu sehen ob er schon so verbittert war, dass er unwürdig war in den Himmel zu kommen, indem er um Rache am Fürsten bat. Doch Kheldon bat um keine der beiden Dinge und sagte stattdessen: "Ich wünsche keine Rache, denn sie brächte mir nichts und ich wünsche kein neues Leben, denn ich bin bereit zu sterben. Mein einziger Wunsch ist es, während meiner letzten Stunden nicht allein zu sein. "Kilmorph betrachtete dies als einen guten Wunsch und gewährte ihn, indem sie allen Figuren die Kheldon erschaffen hatte Leben einhauchte und diese pflegten ihn bis er starb. Nach Kheldons Tod wurde seine Seele auf dem Rücken eines großen Drachen in die Unterwelt getragen und er wurde von den Geistern seiner Vorfahren begrüßt. Die Steinmenschen dagegen gruben sich aus dem Verlies und verbreiteten sich unter der Erde, wo sie zu den heutigen Zwergen wurden. [PARAGRAPH:1]Bambur ist einer der letzten verbliebenen ursprünglichen Zwerge. Er wurde von Kheldon geformt und Kilmorph selbst belebte ihn. Erst ist fast so talentiert als Handwerker wie sein Erschaffer, doch Bambur fertigt Waffen statt Statuen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die erste Generation der Zwerge altert nicht, sie sind noch immer genauso wie damals als sie geschaffen wurden, aber jede neue Zwergengeneration hat eine geringfügig kürzere Lebensdauer. So wie sie sich weiter und weiter vom Lebensatem Kilmorphs entfernen, so werden sie immer sterblicher, sowohl im Geist wie auch im Körper. Bambur musste diesen Verfall mitansehen und selbst der Umbrawächter hat sich von Kilmorph abgewandt, aber Bambur kämpft weiter für seine Göttin und Mutter. Seine Stärke und seine Waffen stehen jedem zu Verfügung, der für Kilmorph kämpft.</German>

There was little hope but they fought because hope was not required, only passion for what they were. And hatred for what they would not become.[PARAGRAPH:1]They were all hurling down. Bhall had succumbed, and in that thought destroyed the heaven that they all occupied. She paid little attention to the war raging around her, a battlefield streaking through the sky, angels flying, burning and killing each other. Bhall was the burning heart of the inferno, like a massive meteor surrounded by thousands of shattered pieces, and Brigit was diving towards her.[PARAGRAPH:1]Brigit landed on her chest, her willpower split between protecting herself, guiding her movements and reaching out to Bhall.

In your loss you will consume creation."[PARAGRAPH:1]There was no response, Brigit raised her sword again, but she could not finish the motion. It was not the pain, or the fall, she was simply unable to do it.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Can you not kill me child?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Bhall's words rang through each of her angel's.

In that second each of the 440 angels that hadn't followed Bhall that had remained loyal to her holy dominion was incinerated in pale yellow flames. The thousands that had followed their queen cheered, Brigit could see that they were already being transformed by their fall into twisted horrid shapes. Of all of Bhall's angels only Brigit remained pure and beautiful.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You will not join me?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No." Brigit remained absolute.[PARAGRAPH:1]Just before striking the ground Bhall threw Brigit away from her.

		<German>Sie verwelkte im Ansturm der Flammen und zum allerersten Mal spürte sie das Gefühl des Brennens. Es war so, als ob sie in die Sonne getaucht wäre. Tränen aus Gold rannen ihr Schwert hinab, so heiß war es, dass es schmolz bevor es sein Ziel treffen konnte. Ihre Rüstung löste und verzog sich und ihre Flügel waren nicht mehr als verkohlte Stummel.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hinter ihr kämpften 440 Engel gegen tausende. Es gab nur wenig Hoffnung, aber sie kämpften, denn Hoffnung war nicht notwendig, nur Hingabe für das, was sie waren. Und Hass auf das, was sie nicht werden wollten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sie stürzten alle zu Boden. Bhall war unterlegen und zerstörte mit diesem Gedanken den Himmel, den sie alle bewohnt hatten. Sie schenkte dem Krieg der um sie herum tobte nur wenig Beachtung, ein Schlachtfeld im Himmel, Engel die einander verbrannten und töteten. Bhall war das brennende Herz dieses Infernos, wie ein riesiger Meteor, umgeben von tausenden Bruchstücken, und Brigit hechtete auf sie zu.[PARAGRAPH:1]Brigit landete auf ihrer Brust, ihre Willenskraft darauf aufgeteilt, sich selbst zu beschützen, ihre Bewegungen zu koordinieren und Bhall zu erreichen. Brigit war kaum größer als der Kopf der Göttin, aber sie erhob ihr Schwert, um es durch Bhalls Herz zu stoßen.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Meine Königin, ihr müsst widerrufen. Die Menschen und die Götter vertrauen auf eure Stärke. Mit eurem Fall werdet ihr die Schöpfung verzehren.[PARAGRAPH:1]Es kam keine Antwort und so erhob Brigit erneut ihr Schwert, aber sie konnte ihre Bewegung nicht zu Ende führen. Es waren nicht Schmerz oder der Sturz, der sie aufhielt, sie war einfach nicht in der Lage, es zu tun.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Kannst du mich etwa nicht töten, mein Kind?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Bhalls Worte klingelten in Ohren all ihrer Engel. Hinter sich konnte Brigit den Boden näher kommen sehen. Dort, unter ihr, lag eine große Stadt mit großen Türmen und riesigen Tempeln.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ihr könnt nicht fallen, ihr könnt es nicht geschehen lassen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Bhall schloss ihre Augen, ganz so als ob sie diese Aussage überdenken würde. Dann schlug sie in Richtung ihres größten Engels und hielt Brigit in ihrer rechten Hand fest und zeigte sie den kriegführenden Engeln. In dieser Sekunde verbrannte jeder der 440 Engel, die Bhall nicht gefolgt, sondern ihrer heiligen Domäne treu geblieben waren, in hellen gelben Flammen. Die tausenden die ihrer Königin gefolgt waren jubelten und Brigit konnte sehen, dass sie bereits durch ihren Fall in perverse und abscheuliche Gestalten verwandelt wurden. Von allen Engeln Bhalls blieb nur Brigit rein und schön.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Du wirst mir nicht folgen?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Nein." Brigit blieb standhaft.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kurz bevor sie auf dem Boden aufschlug schleuderte Bhall Brigit von sich weg. Zu einem Platz, Kreaturen des Feuers niemals besuchen würden, tief in den gefrorenen Einöden aus Schnee und Eis. Bhalls Befehle folgten ihr nach, bildeten ein Gefängnis für den Erzengel, einen Ring aus Licht der jeden verbrennen würde, der versucht ihn zu durchschreiten. Und so ist Brigit bis zum heutigen Tage in ihm gefangen.</German>

		<English>The catapult was one of the earliest forms of artillery. It was a large mechanical arm that propelled heavy stones and other missiles from a great distance, battering down walls and inflicting damage on buildings and defenders. Catapults could easily launch projectiles 500 to 1000 feet with a surprising amount of force behind them. Though cumbersome and nearly useless on the battlefield, the catapult was an effective weapon for siege operations.</English>

		<German>Das Katapult war eine Frühform der Artillerie. Mit seinem mechanischen Hebelarm wurden schwere Steine und andere Ladungen über grosse Distanzen auf Befestigungsanlagen, Gebäude und Verteidiger geschleudert. Katapulte besitzen eine Reichweite von 150 bis 300 Metern und überraschen durch hohe Durchschlagskraft. Auf dem Schlachtfeld aufgrund ihrer Trägheit nahezu nutzlos, bilden sie doch für Belagerungen eine sehr effektive Waffe.</German>

The weapon is fairly simple to produce in bulk and frighteningly effective at piercing armor, which meant that the peasants finally could take up the fight with the knights and men-at-arms that made up the fist of the Royalist armies. The mechanism is simple: a winch tightens the bow to a tautness that is practically unachievable by muscle power alone. The projectile is a small bolt, rather like a truncated arrow. The result is a weapon that fires straight and true with little effort and with little training required.</English>

		<German>Die Armbrust war die bevorzugte Waffe der Bauern während des Ersten Aufstandes. Diese Waffe kann recht einfach in großen Mengen hergestellt werden und ist erschreckend wirkungsvoll im Durchschlagen von Panzerungen. Dadurch konnten die Bauern den Kampf mit Rittern und Landsknechten aufnehmen, aus denen die Vorhut der königlichen Armeen bestand. Der Mechanismus ist einfach: eine Winde spannt den Bogen so straff wie es durch Muskelkraft nicht erreichbar ist. Das Geschoss ist eher ein kleiner Bolzen, denn ein verkürzter Pfeil. Das Ergebnis ist eine Waffe, die mit wenig Aufwand gerade und genau schießt und die nur ein weniges an Übung bedarf.</German>

		<English>Eidolons are demon disciple units that offer alternate upgrades for Champions and Priests. They require Iron or Mithril and an evil alignment, but no specific building. Priest upgraded Eidolons keep their spells, and melee upgraded Eidolons keep any melee-only promotions they have acquired, so consider upgrading rather than building directly. In any case, they multi-use units with high strength and free march promotion.</English>

Sie erfordern Eisen oder Mithril und stehen nur bösen Reichen zur Verfügung, erfordern jedoch kein Gebäude. Zu Eidolons aufgerüstete Priester behalten ihre Zaubersprüche, und Nahkampfeinheiten behalten alle für sie spezifischen Beförderungen, die sie erworben haben. Daher sollte man in Betracht ziehen andere Einheiten aufzurüsten anstatt Eidolons direkt zu bauen. In jedem Fall sind sie vielseitige Einheiten mit hoher Stärke und einer freien "Marschieren"-Beförderung.</German>

It was already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs.[PARAGRAPH:1]How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I had endeavored to form? His limbs were in proportion, and I had selected his features as beautiful. Beautiful!-Great God!

		<German>Es war eine düstere Nacht im November, als ich das Ergebnis meiner Mühen betrachtete. Mit einer Heftigkeit, die fast schon zu Schmerz wurde, sammelte ich die Werkzeuge des Lebens um mich, damit ich einen Funken des Seins in das leblose Ding zu meinen Füßen leiten könnte. Es war bereits um Eins in der Früh; der Regen prasselte unangenehm gegen die Scheiben, und meine Kerze war fast schon heruntergebrannt, als ich, im Schein des halb erloschenen Lichtes, sah, wie sich das trübe gelbe Auge der Kreatur öffnete; sie atmete schwer, und spasmische Zuckungen bewegten ihre Glieder. [PARAGRAPH:1] Wie soll ich nur meine Gefühle bei dieser Katastrophe beschreiben, oder wie das Scheusal erläutern, das ich mit so unendlichen Mühen und Sorgfalt zu formen versucht hatte? Seine Glieder waren gleichmäßig gesetzt, und ich hatte sein Aussehen wunderschön gestaltet. Wunderschön! - Großer Gott! Seine gelbe Haut verbarg kaum die Arbeit der Muskeln und Arterien unter ihr; sein Haar war von einem ausgewählten Schwarz, und fließend; seine Zähne von einer perlfarbenen Weißheit; aber diese Verzierungen bildeten nur einen noch erschreckenderen Kontrast zu seinen wässrigen Augen, die fast von der selben Farbe zu sein schienen, wie die nebligweißen Augenhöhlen, in die sie eingelassen waren, zu seiner verkümmerten Gesichtsfarbe und den geraden schwarzen Lippen.[PARAGRAPH:2]- V.F.</German>

		<English>Gaelan was a talented summoner and mage in the Laeran Cord. Frustrated with the slow progress within the Cord, Gaelan started the Circle of Gaelan. The Circle gained a reputation for dangerous acts followed by tragedy. There were escaped summoned creatures, death of livestock, a fire that nearly destroyed a village and human experimentation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But the worst mistake of the Circle of Gaelan was an attempt to summon the archangel Hastur.

These oarsmen were highly paid professionals or patriotic citizens (except in Overlords countries). A huge, bronze "beak" mounted at the bow of the ship was used to ram and sink enemy ships. Because of its long, narrow hull, the galley was very unstable in all but the calmest waters, and as a consequence its crew rarely ventured out of sight of land for long periods of time, lest the ship be caught in a storm and sunk.</English>

		<English>It was originally thought that goblins were merely the runts of the Orc populations, but later it was confirmed that they are indeed a distinct species. What has been obvious from the first notice of these sad creatures is their dismal fate. They are kicked around by anyone above them in the Orc hierarchy, which is to say everyone. They get no respect from Orcs, Ogres, or Lizardmen, and even their Wolf mounts have been known to turn on goblins if they get a bit hungry. Some Goblins accept this fate, and they can be found doing the most menial tasks in the Barbarian villages. Most however channel this abuse into hatred for the outside world, and they are sent out ahead of Orc war bands to cause mayhem where ever they can. Woe to the worker or scout that is ambushed by a group of these goblins.</English>

		<German>Lange Zeit ging man davon aus, dass Goblins nichts weiter als kleinwüchsige Orks seien, bis festgestellt wurde, dass sie in der Tat eine eigenständige Spezies bilden. Was bei diesen traurigen Kreaturen auf den ersten Blick eindeutig ist, ist ihre Bestimmung. Sie werden von jedem, der über ihnen in der Ork-Hierarchie steht herumgeschubst, was so ziemlich auf alle anderen Orks zutrifft. Sie werden von Orks, Trollen und Echsenkriegern gleichermaßen verachtet und sogar die wilden Wölfe, die sie reiten, fallen bisweilen über sie her, wenn sie ein wenig hungrig sind. Einige Goblins finden sich mit diesem Schicksal ab und erledigen die niedrigsten Aufgaben in den Barbarendörfern. Bei den meisten allerdings führen diese Erniedrigungen zu einem Hass gegen alles und jeden. Sie werden den Kriegern der Orks vorausgeschickt, um Chaos zu verursachen, wo sie nur können. Wehe dem Bautrupp oder Späher der von einer Gruppe dieser Goblins überfallen wird.</German>

		<English>A horse archer (or horsed archer or mounted archer) is a cavalryman armed with a bow. Because using a bow requires a horseman to let go of the reins with both hands, horse archers need superb equestrian skills. Horse archery is typically associated with steppe nomads. [PARAGRAPH:1]The weapon of choice for horse archers was the recurve bow, because it was compact enough to shoot from a horse and retained sufficient range and penetrating power. The most serious threat to horse archers was arrows, and they could wheel away out of bowshot after every attack. Mounted archers therefore needed little or no armor and could ride light, fast mounts such as ponies. This made them cheap to equip and increased their strategic mobility. [PARAGRAPH:1]A drawback of horse archers was that the movements of a running horse disturbed the accuracy of the shot. After the invention of the stirrup, horse archers would stand up in their stirrups to absorb the motion of the horse. Another method to facilitate accurate shooting was to time shots between the strides of the horse.</English>

		<German>Ein Berittener Bogenschütze ist ein Kavallerist bewaffnet mit einem Bogen. Weil das Benutzen des Bogens es erfordert mit beiden Händen die Zügel loszulassen, brauchen Berittene Bogenschützen herausragende Reiterfähigkeiten. Berittene Bogenschützen werden oft mit Steppennomaden in Verbindung gebracht. [PARAGRAPH:1] Die Waffe der Wahl für einen Berittenen Bogenschützen ist ein gebogener Bogen, weil er kompakt genug war um von einem Pferd aus zu schießen, gleichzeitig aber über ausreichende Reichweite und Durchschlagskraft verfügte. Die größte Bedrohung für Berittene Bogenschützen stellten Pfeile dar und sie konnten jedem Schuss auf sich ausweichen Deswegen brauchten die Berittenen Bogenschützen leichte oder gar keine Panzerung und konnten leichte und schnelle Pferde wie Ponys reiten. Dies machte sie günstig auszustatten und erhöhte ihre strategische Einsatzfähigkeit. [PARAGRAPH:1]ein Manko der Berittenen Bogenschützen war allerdings, dass die Bewegungen eines sich bewegenden Pferdes die Genauigkeit des Schusses beeinträchtigten. Nach der Erfindung des Steigbügels standen die Bogenschützen auf, um die Bewegung des Pferdes zu dämpfen. Eine andere Methode um die Genauigkeit zu erhöhen war es, zwischen den Schritten der Pferde zu schießen.</German>

		<German>Lichs werden von Erzmagiern erschaffen, die den Zauber Lich verwenden.  Es bringt einige Vorteile, Erzmagier in Lichs umzuwandeln. Der wohl wichtigste ist, dass dadurch ein Platz für einen anderen Erzmagier frei wird (jede Zivilisation kann nur drei auf einmal besitzen). Lichs Erhalten automatisch die Kampf I- und die Zauberreichweite I-Beförderung. Außerdem sind Lichs untot und somit sind sie anfällig gegen einige Zauber wie etwa Untote zerstören, Jedoch sind sie immun gegen andere Zauber, beispielsweise Beeindrucken und Infektion.</German>

		<German>Söldner sind sich verkaufende Schwerter, Barbaren, die für ihre geheimen Fähigkeiten und ihre kriegerische Art angeheuert wurden. Sie wurden mit einem Schwert in der Hand geboren und selbst mit leichter Ausrüstung, stellen sie eine ungeheuer geballte Schlagkraft dar. Selbst diejenigen, die noch Grün hinter den Ohren sind dienen als "Kanonenfutter" um stärkere Rivalen oder "Verbündete" zu behindern, und mit genug Erfahrung können sie fast jeden Soldaten hinter sich zurücklassen. Die untersetzten Barbaren aus der Steppe wachsen zusammen mit ihren Reittieren auf und leben zusammen mit ihnen, bis der Tod entweder vom Reiter oder Reittier sie voneinander trennt. Die Tatsache, das sie ihre Freunde in Sekundenschnelle herbeirufen können, macht es zu einer guten Idee, ein oder zwei in Grenzstädten zu postieren, so lange das Geld weiter fließt. Ein Söldner, der einige Zeit in den Streitkräften irgendeiner Nation, die sie brauchte, gedient hat, hört nach jedermanns  Standard reich, und nach dem Standard der Nomaden, von den sie abstammen, als sagenhaft reich auf. Die Arbeit als ein Söldner kann oft zu dem Vermögen verhelfen, das benötigt wird, wenn man sich um die Kontrolle des Stammes bemüht und es ist bekannt, das sich Soldaten ihren alten Waffengefährten gegenübersahen, die ein barbarisches Überfallkommando anführten, aber das ist nicht immer der Fall. Gelehrte Menschen sagen, dass die Söldner vielleicht auch einige Aspekte der Zivilisation mit sich zurückbringen. Man kann immer hoffen, dass die Barbaren gewillt sind von ihrem Beispiel zu lernen; unglücklicherweise scheinen sie mehr von der Kunst der Waffenherstellung angetan zu sein.</German>

		<English>The smoke twisted randomly, as if caught in breeze that was impossible in the small summoning chamber. Kael knelt in a ring with the other students watching the mage in the center demonstrate the experiment in conjuration.[PARAGRAPH:1]A figured formed in the smoke, an imp a little over 2 feet tall. His chest was soot black, and he grew lighter gray and hazy along his legs and arms, until his feet and hands were nothing but thin trails of smoke. The embers from the fire danced up into his body and whipped randomly around him, settling in his eyes, which floated lazily, and separately, around his forehead.[PARAGRAPH:1]He glared at the students until Bradeline, the red robed mage, shouted "Zazim!"[PARAGRAPH:1]The imp's ears folded back against his head at the sound of his name.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Why do you bring me here?" The imp's voice popped like greasy meat in a hot pan.[PARAGRAPH:1]"They will try to control the conversation, lead you where they want to go. Innocent at first, but it is a trap. Speak only of what you want from the creature, you did not summon it for idle conversation."[PARAGRAPH:1]One of the imp's eyes remained fixed on Bradeline, while the other floated around his head going from student to student, looking for weakness. Kael was easily 10 years older than the rest of the students, and couldn't tell if the imp noticed this or not. Most of the other students paled and looked away at the imp's glare. A few returned the stare, their own fear overcome by their lust for power. Kael didn't react at all, and the imp's gaze passed quickly on to the next student.[PARAGRAPH:1]After its examination of the room the imp dropped, placing his wraithlike hands on the stone floor. The fire brightened and the smoke flared out, momentarily obscuring the imp's form. From within the circle its scratchy voice could be heard speaking unholy words.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The daft creature is attempting to summon more of its kin." Bradeline looked almost disappointed. "Most would attempt to flee, but both attempts will be blocked by the summoning circle you constructed. Its call can not penetrate the shell of sorcery, symbols and the enchanted powder."[PARAGRAPH:1]Bradeline took a chain from his belt and held it toward the imp. He let go of the end, letting a copper medallion inscribed with a six pointed star swing down as he shouted the imp's name again. Bradeline was as much a performer as he was a conjurer. This time Zazim ignored him.[PARAGRAPH:1]The powder was enchanted exactly as it should be, but it was not all silver as the spell required. The imp's call was heard, and in a gust of wind the ill-prepared powder was blown all over the surrounding shocked students. Bradeline didn't have much time for surprise, the newly formed greater demon that stood over the imp reached out and grabbed his throat.[PARAGRAPH:1]The demon stood almost to the room's concave ceiling. He had the hooves of a goat, thick twisted legs, and the chest and arms of a massive gorilla. He had two human heads, one with its mouth sewn shut, constantly screaming behind its pursed lips, and the other looked to have had its eyes recently gouged out. Blood and ichor ran down this face and dripped onto the right side of the demon's chest. On one forearm the demon had almost a dozen battered gold rings.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Command me now, blood trader!" The demon grinned. Bradeline had summoned him many times, and forced him to perform acts degrading even to demons. The mage raised the medallion ineffectually in front of the demon's face, the one with eyes, but the demon only laughed. He would have toyed with Bradeline longer, but the students began to scream and he realized he had more fun in store than just this one killing. With a squeeze, Bradeline's neck was broken and the demon threw the mage's body against the stone wall of the chamber. Then he turned on the students.[PARAGRAPH:1]A boy, more full of ego than sense, began to recite a spell prohibited to students this young. He shot his hands out toward the demon as he finished the incantation. But he was not ready for a spell that complex, and the fire intended for the demon raced up the boy's arms instead. He fell screaming as the flames consumed his shoulders and head.[PARAGRAPH:1]Another student, one that had looked away when Zazim glared at him, had his screams cut short as the imp leapt to his chest and climbed into his mouth. Kael watched the students face flush at the realization that he wouldn't live long enough to be killed by the two headed demon that was tearing into the other students. The student fell, choking and grabbed hold of Kael's drab brown acolyte robes. Kael ignored him, the only unmoving piece of the hellish room.[PARAGRAPH:1]The room's single door was enchanted, only Bradeline or one of the academy's other instructors could open it. This was to prevent any creature that was summoned here from getting loose and threatening the school. It had seemed a reasonable precaution to the students when they had learned of it, but now as they beat on the chamber door they realized the limitations of the door's protection.[PARAGRAPH:1]-The Tale of Saverous, Act II: Chapter 1</English>

		<German>Der Rauch wandt sich willkürlich, so als ob er in einer Brise gefangen wäre, doch das war unmöglich innerhalb der kleinen Beschwörungskammer. Kael kniete zusammen mit den anderen Studenten in einem Kreis um den Magier und beobachtete ihn dabei, wie er ein Beschwörungsexperiment durchführte. [PARAGRAPH:1]Ein Umriss formte sich aus dem Rauch, es entstand ein Kobold der etwas mehr als 2 Fuß groß war. Sein Brustkasten war so schwarz wie Ruß, seine Arme und Beine waren heller und nebelhafter, bis hin zu seinen Händen, die nicht mehr waren als dünne Rauchschleier. Die glühenden Kohlen des Feuers tanzten durch seinen Körper und schwangen willkürlich um ihn herum und beruhigten sich in Höhe der Augen, welche bewegungslos und abgeschieden um seine Stirn schwebten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Er starrte die Studenten an, solange bis Bradeline, der Magier mit der roten Robe, "Zazim!" schrie. [PARAGRAPH:1]Die Ohren des Kobolds legten sich an den Kopf an, als er seinen Namen hörte. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Warum bringst du mich hier her?" Die Stimme des Kobolds zischte wie fettiges Fleisch in einer heißen Pfanne.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sie werden versuchen das Gespräch zu übernehmen, um euch dorthin zu führen wo sie euch haben wollen. Es scheint zunächst unschuldig, doch es ist eine Falle. Sagt nur, was ihr von der Kreatur wollt, ihr habt sie nicht beschworen um euch mit ihr zu unterhalten."[PARAGRAPH:1]Ein Auge des Kobolds verharrte auf Bradeline, während das andere um den Kopf schwebte und Studenten um Studenten nach Schwächen absuchte. Kael war wenigstens 10 Jahre älter als die anderen Studenten und war sich nicht sicher ob dies dem Kobold aufgefallen war. Die meisten der Studenten wurden bleich und wandten sich vor dem wütenden Starren des Kobolds ab. Einige erwiderten das Starren, ihr Verlangen nach Macht hatte die eigene Angst überwältigt. Kael reagierte überhaupt nicht und so wanderte der Blick des Kobolds schnell weiter zum nächsten Studenten. [PARAGRAPH:1]Nach der Untersuchung des Raums lies sich der Kobold nieder, indem er seine gespensterhaften Hände auf den Boden legte. Das Feuer wurde heller und der Rauch brauste auf, wodurch sich die Form des Kobolds für einen Moment seltsam verzerrte. Innerhalb des Kreises konnte man seine kratzende Stimme hören wie sie unheilige Worte aussprach.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Das bescheuerte Geschöpf versucht mehr von seiner Art zu beschwören. Bradeline blickte fast schon enttäuscht. "Die meisten würden versuchen zu flüchten, aber beide Versuche werden vom Beschwörungszirkel, den ihr geschaffen habt, blockiert. Sein Ruf kann den Mantel der Zauberei, der Symbole und des verzauberten Pulvers nicht durchdringen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Bradeline nahm eine Kette seines Gürtels und reichte sie dem Kobold. Er lies das Ende los, sodass ein Kupfermedaillon, das einen sechszackigen Stern eingraviert hatte, herunterschwang als er den Namen des Kobolds erneut ausrief. Bradeline war genauso sehr Schauspieler, wie er Beschwörer war. Dieses Mal ignorierte ihn Zazim jedoch. [PARAGRAPH:1]Das Pulver war genauso verzaubert wie es sein sollte, aber es war nicht aus reinem Silber, so wie es der Zauber verlangt. Der Ruf des Kobolds wurde gehört und im Zuge eines Windstoßes wurde das schlecht vorbereitete Pulver über die umgebenden Studenten verstreut. Bradeline hatte kaum Zeit sich zu wundern, denn der neu erschaffene größere Dämon stand über dem Kobold griff nach ihm und packte ihn am Hals. [PARAGRAPH:1]Der Dämon berührte beinahe die konkave Decke des Raumes. Er hatte die Hufe einer Ziege, dicke, gekrümmte Beine und die Brust und die Arme eines gewaltigen Gorillas. Er hatte 2 menschliche Köpfe, einer der seinen Mund verschlossen und zugenäht hatte und pausenlos schrie und der andere sah aus als wären ihm erst kürzlich die Augen ausgehöhlt worden. Blut und Eiter rannten diesem über das Gesicht und tropfte auf die rechte Seite der Dämonenbrust. An einem seiner Oberarme hatte der Dämon beinahe ein Duzend ramponierte Goldringe hängen.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Kommandiere mich nun, oh Bluthändler!", sprach der Dämon grinsend. Bradeline hatte ihn schon oft beschworen und Dinge tun lassen, die selbst für einen Dämon erniedrigend waren. Der Zauberer hob das unwirksame Medaillon vor das Gesicht des Dämons, vor das, welches noch Augen hatte, doch der Dämon lachte nur. Er hätte noch länger mit Bradeline gespielt, doch er bemerkte, dass die Studenten zu schreien begannen und ihm wurde klar, dass es heute noch mehr Vergnügen gab als nur einen einzigen Mord. Nach kurzem Drücken war Bradelines Genick gebrochen und der Dämon warf den Körper des Zauberers gegen die Steinmauer der Halle. Dann wandte er sich den Studenten zu.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ein Junge, der mehr Ego als Verstand hatte, begann damit einen Zauber anzuwenden, der Zauberern in diesem Alter verboten war. Er reckte seine Hände in Richtung des Dämons als er die Zauberformel zu ende gesprochen hatte. Aber er war für einen derart komplexen Spruch noch nicht bereit, und das Feuer, welches für den Dämon gedacht war, brannte sich an seinen Armen entlang. Er fiel schreiend zu Boden, als die Flammen seine Schultern und seinen Kopf verzehrten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Einem anderen Schüler, ein von denen die sich Zazims Blick abwandten, wurden seine Schreie abgeschnürt, als der Kobold auf seine Schulter sprang und in den Mund des Schülers kletterte. Kael beobachte das Erröten des Schülers, als dieser begriff, dass er nicht lange genug leben würde um vom zweiköpfigen Dämon getötet zu werden, der sich den anderen Schülern zugewandt hatte. Der Schüler fiel zu Boden, würgte und klammerte sich an Kaels düsterbrauner Akolytenrobe. Kael ignorierte ihn, er war das einzige stille Element in dieser höllischen Halle.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die einzige Tür des Raums war verzaubert, nur Bradeline oder einer der anderen Lehrer der Akademie konnten sie öffnen. Dies diente dazu, dass eine beschworene Kreatur nicht entkommen und in der Schule Schaden anrichten konnte. Das erschien den Schülern als vernünftig, als die etwas darüber lernten, doch nun, als sie auf die Türe einhämmerten, begriffen sie die Einschränkung in der Schutzfähigkeit der Türe.[PARAGRAPH:1] - Die Legende des Saverous, Akt 2, Kapitel 1</German>
		<Italian>The smoke twisted randomly, as if caught in breeze that was impossible in the small summoning chamber. Kael knelt in a ring with the other students watching the mage in the center demonstrate the experiment in conjuration.[PARAGRAPH:1]A figured formed in the smoke, an imp a little over 2 feet tall. His chest was soot black, and he grew lighter gray and hazy along his legs and arms, until his feet and hands were nothing but thin trails of smoke. The embers from the fire danced up into his body and whipped randomly around him, settling in his eyes, which floated lazily, and separately, around his forehead.[PARAGRAPH:1]He glared at the students until Bradeline, the red robed mage, shouted "Zazim!"[PARAGRAPH:1]The imp's ears folded back against his head at the sound of his name.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Why do you bring me here?" The imp's voice popped like greasy meat in a hot pan.[PARAGRAPH:1]"They will try to control the conversation, lead you where they want to go. Innocent at first, but it is a trap. Speak only of what you want from the creature, you did not summon it for idle conversation."[PARAGRAPH:1]One of the imp's eyes remained fixed on Bradeline, while the other floated around his head going from student to student, looking for weakness. Kael was easily 10 years older than the rest of the students, and couldn't tell if the imp noticed this or not. Most of the other students paled and looked away at the imp's glare. A few returned the stare, their own fear overcome by their lust for power. Kael didn't react at all, and the imp's gaze passed quickly on to the next student.[PARAGRAPH:1]After its examination of the room the imp dropped, placing his wraithlike hands on the stone floor. The fire brightened and the smoke flared out, momentarily obscuring the imp's form. From within the circle its scratchy voice could be heard speaking unholy words.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The daft creature is attempting to summon more of its kin." Bradeline looked almost disappointed. "Most would attempt to flee, but both attempts will be blocked by the summoning circle you constructed. Its call can not penetrate the shell of sorcery, symbols and the enchanted powder."[PARAGRAPH:1]Bradeline took a chain from his belt and held it toward the imp. He let go of the end, letting a copper medallion inscribed with a six pointed star swing down as he shouted the imp's name again. Bradeline was as much a performer as he was a conjurer. This time Zazim ignored him.[PARAGRAPH:1]The powder was enchanted exactly as it should be, but it was not all silver as the spell required. The imp's call was heard, and in a gust of wind the ill-prepared powder was blown all over the surrounding shocked students. Bradeline didn't have much time for surprise, the newly formed greater demon that stood over the imp reached out and grabbed his throat.[PARAGRAPH:1]The demon stood almost to the room's concave ceiling. He had the hooves of a goat, thick twisted legs, and the chest and arms of a massive gorilla. He had two human heads, one with its mouth sewn shut, constantly screaming behind its pursed lips, and the other looked to have had its eyes recently gouged out. Blood and ichor ran down this face and dripped onto the right side of the demon's chest. On one forearm the demon had almost a dozen battered gold rings.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Command me now, blood trader!" The demon grinned. Bradeline had summoned him many times, and forced him to perform acts degrading even to demons. The mage raised the medallion ineffectually in front of the demon's face, the one with eyes, but the demon only laughed. He would have toyed with Bradeline longer, but the students began to scream and he realized he had more fun in store than just this one killing. With a squeeze, Bradeline's neck was broken and the demon threw the mage's body against the stone wall of the chamber. Then he turned on the students.[PARAGRAPH:1]A boy, more full of ego than sense, began to recite a spell prohibited to students this young. He shot his hands out toward the demon as he finished the incantation. But he was not ready for a spell that complex, and the fire intended for the demon raced up the boy's arms instead. He fell screaming as the flames consumed his shoulders and head.[PARAGRAPH:1]Another student, one that had looked away when Zazim glared at him, had his screams cut short as the imp leapt to his chest and climbed into his mouth. Kael watched the students face flush at the realization that he wouldn't live long enough to be killed by the two headed demon that was tearing into the other students. The student fell, choking and grabbed hold of Kael's drab brown acolyte robes. Kael ignored him, the only unmoving piece of the hellish room.[PARAGRAPH:1]The room's single door was enchanted, only Bradeline or one of the academy's other instructors could open it. This was to prevent any creature that was summoned here from getting loose and threatening the school. It had seemed a reasonable precaution to the students when they had learned of it, but now as they beat on the chamber door they realized the limitations of the door's protection.[PARAGRAPH:1]-The Tale of Saverous, Act II: Chapter 1</Italian>

However, even the Luchuirp Arch-Enchanters found themselves unable to bind any enchantments, no matter what form it was given. For a long time the idea was thought to be impossible.

Every dwarven woman and child had been beheaded, the men dragged towards the waters, presumably to rise again and spread the misery further through the land. Kilmorph's heart broke, and she spoke to Stonewarden, instructing him to build the largest golem ever seen, shaped like a dwarf but cast of pure Mithril. When the time golem was finished, he was told, Kilmorph would give it life as their spells could not. What they would do with it was up to them; the goddess knew she was intervening too much already. The Stonewarden nodded, and gathered his hammer and set off for the Holy city. It would take a long time to forge the parts, and much blood would be shed as he toiled stoically day after day.

		<German>Mithril ist zum Teil geschätzt für seine Eigenschaft Zaubersprüchen aller Arten zu widerstehen und als Material heißbegehrter Rüstungen für jedweden Krieger. Sogar die Rufer der Luchuirp waren erfolglos beim Versuch irgendeine Verzauberung an das Mithril zu binden. Lange Zeit dachte man es sei unmöglich. Dann wurde eines Tages eine Zwergenstadt von einer Legion von Ertränkten überrannt. Der Edelsteinwächter, der die Ruinen entdeckte, schrie zu Kilmorph empor und zerriss seine Robe während er vom Grauen gepackt auf die Knie fiel. Selbst Zwergenfrauen und -kinder wurden enthauptet und die Männer in die Gewässer geschleppt, vermutlich um wieder aufzuerstehen und das Unheil weiter im Land zu verbreiten. Kilmorphs Herz brach und sie sprach zu dem Edelsteinwächter. Sie wies ihn an den größten Golem zu bauen, der je gesehen wurde, in Form eines Zwergs doch gegossen aus purem Mithril. Sobald der Golem fertiggestellt sein wird, sagte sie dem Wächter, werde Kilmorph das tun, was allen anderen nicht geglückt war, sie würde dem Mithrilgolem Leben einhauchen. Was sie mit ihm anstellten war ihnen überlassen; die Göttin wusste, dass sie schon zu weit eingegriffen hatte. Der Edelsteinwächter nickte, nahm seinen Hammer und machte sich auf den Weg in die Heilige Stadt. Es würde lange dauern, die Teile zu schmieden und viel Blut würde vergossen werden wenn er Tag für Tag stoisch daran schuftete. Doch das Böse würde aus dem Land vertrieben werden ... für immer!</German>

He made growls and weapon noises as he pretended they were fighting.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What have we here, a frostling out by himself?" [PARAGRAPH:1]Two scouts approached, weapons drawn. Mokka's staff lay on the ground beside him, but he was unwilling to give up his play to grab it. Instead he held the stickman up to the closest scout. Unimpressed the scout raised his axe. Mokka snapped the stickman in two; as it broke so did the scout, bending backwards until his head slammed into his heels with a thud. [PARAGRAPH:1]The second scout stepped away, terrified. [PARAGRAPH:1]Mokka held the snow beast out towards him, shaking it gently in the air. The scout heard the snow rising up behind him. Mokka had lost his stickman, he would need new toys to entertain him, and these new toys made their own sounds.</English>

Indifférent, ce dernier leva sa hache.

		<English>I had hoped to settle the argument over the existence of the Council of Esus as a religious entity and to put my proof in writing in this tome.

		<German>Ich hatte gehofft, meine Thesen über die Existenz des Rates des Esus als eine religiöse Macht beweisen und den Beiweis in diesem Buch niederschreiben zu können. Aber leider waren die Ergebnisse meiner Reisen nicht so aufschlussreich wie ich es eigentlich vorhergesagt hatte und selbst nachdem ich viele Städte besucht und auch in so abgeschlossenen Gemeinschaften wie den Svartalfar und den Calabim gelebt habe, bleiben letzte Zweifel. Ich möchte, als letzten Hinweis auf meine Theorien bezüglich dieses Kultes, dass er nämlich wahrhaftig existiert und zahlreiche Anhänger hat, diese eine Geschichte hinterlassen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nach einiger Zeit in Gareth Minar fühlte ich mich mit der Stadt vertraut genug, dass ich mich wagte Nachts alleine unterwegs zu sein. Als ich das Heim eines reichen Mannes, ein ausländischer Händler, der einer Loge der Schmiedegilde vorstand, passierte, hörte ich einen dumpfen Schrei. Einen Blick in den Hinterhof riskierend, sah ich einen Assasinen über den Händler gebeugt stehen, der Gerade seine Klinge wieder einsteckte. Unglücklicherweise - für den Assassinen - wählte die Frau des Händlers genau diesesn Augenblick, um nach ihrem Mann zu sehen und ihr Schreckensschrei zerriss die Stille der Nacht. Der Assassine versuchte zu fliehen und obwohl ich ihm hastig folgte, hatte ich ihn doch irgendwann aus den Augen verloren.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dann sah ich den Assassinen erneut, umringt von Männern in dunklen Mänteln und mit Kurzbögen bewaffnet. Dies waren nicht die hell gekleideten Wächter die ich im Wachhaus gesehen hatte, aber sie schienen die Stadt diese Nacht zu beschützen. Wie auch immer, der Assassine gab sich zu erkennen und formte mit seinen Händen ein Zeichen. Die Nachtwache senkte ihre Waffen und tat es ihm gleich. Ein paar Münzen wechselten den Besitzer und dann wurde der Assassine gehen gelassen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Normalerweise hätte ich das ganze als normale Korruption bezeichnet, wäre da nicht die unnatürliche Dunkelheit und Kälte gewesen, die diese Nachtwache umgab, und als sie fortgingen bemerkte ich erst, dass sich jede Kerze und Lampe die sie passierten verdunkelte, die Schatten um sie herum aber unverändert ließ. Zwar kann das nicht beweisen was ich bisher an Theorien vorbrachte, aber es passt zu den wenigen anderen Geschichten, die wir bereits über den "Rat des Esus" gehört haben.[PARAGRAPH:2]Auszug aus Kapitel 6 der "Reflektionen über Staatsreligionen", verfasst von Ältester Methyl der Luonnatar.</German>

Sie üben Tag und Nacht, marschieren in schweren Rüstungen, bis viele vor Erschöpfung zusammenbrechen sind: die Abbrecher für diesen Tag. Der Kampfeswille wird ihnen ebenfalls antrainiert. Befehle werden ohne nachzudenken, geschweige denn zögern, befolgt und jeder einzelne würde für seine Kameraden sterben. Wenn die Ausbildung abgeschlossen ist und die Einheiten ausgerüstet sind, stehen ihrer Nation Soldaten zur Verfügung, die in der Lage sind, jede befestigte Stadt zu erstürmen, einen blutigen Kampf bis zum letzten Mann auszutragen und daraus siegreich hervorzugehen.

		<German>Sie waren mit allem versorgt, was sie benötigten. Es gab keine Krankheiten oder Schwächen, nur eine fantastische Welt, die sie faszinierte und von der sie lernen konnten. Überglücklich waren sie, bis zu jenem Tag, an dem sie jemanden mit einer noch außergewöhnlicheren Gabe trafen. So erfuhren sie erstmals Kummer.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dieser Kummer zerfraß sie; sie konnten nicht mehr die Dinge würdigen, die sie besaßen, sie wurden nur noch vom Verlangen erfüllt, Dinge zu besitzen, die anderen gehörten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Eine Gesellschaft ohne Opferbereitschaft macht es unmöglich, echte Kriege zu führen, stattdessen herrschten untereinander Lug und Trug. Einige Wenige versuchten sich vor dem Neid zu schützen, indem sie ihre Augen verdeckten. Ohne die ständige Versuchung  wurden sie zufriedener und blieben am Ende als Einzige verschont.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nun werden sie von Fremden "Nachtschwärmern", die Enthüller, genannt. Ihrer Abstammung treu haben sie eine Vorliebe für Glückspiel und Diebstahl. Sie gelangen in jede Stadt mit einem Glücksspielhaus, welche ein Tor zu den Äußeren Ebenen enthält. Ihre Augen mögen verbunden bleiben, doch das behindert sie nicht dabei, sie sind sogar fähig, Schatten und andere unsichtbare Einheiten zu entdecken.</German>

		<English>There were four in the chamber-tradition said there should only be three, and it wasn't like the Order to break tradition. The room was round with a domed ceiling and a mosaic of Lord Sabathiel on it. It was late, and the evening prayers could be heard echoing from the sanctuary.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rosier knelt on the floor; he was an Oath-taker here to report on an oath he had exacted. The Oath-takers served two roles: exacting oaths, and punishing those that broke them. As was typical, there was also a Confessor here. The Confessors extracted information, they were the eyes and the ears of the Order, and they served as a witness and record keeper for these trials. The last normal member of the trial was a Diviner. A Diviner was able to tell if any Oath made in Junil's name would be broken or not.[PARAGRAPH:1]What had Rosier flush with anger was the Diviner's instances on having a fourth person at the meeting: a fellow Oath-taker, Valin Phanuel. Valin stood back by the door, unsure of what to do. The trial (like all things the Order did) had very precise steps. It was a ceremony for three people, and only the Diviner seemed comfortable breaking that. She started.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Arise Rosier, Knight of the 2nd Heart, Oath-taker and Nonpareil."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rosier stood and repeated the phrase, as he had many times before, "I am the shield till the sword comes free, I am a bearer of the law until my lord gives me rest, I am a keeper of peace until the oath is broken."[PARAGRAPH:1]"What oath do you bring me, child?"[PARAGRAPH:1]This Diviner was new, a woman, which was unusual. The former Diviner of the Abbey had been called back, the reason unknown. This was the first time Rosier had met the new Diviner, but he had heard that her unusual behavior had infuriated more than just the Abbey Confessor. Rosier pushed those thoughts back and focused on the reason he was here.[PARAGRAPH:1]"At the Osul mountains, a small company of Twisted men were captured. They had served the Burnt Priest, but with him dead and his summoned legions gone, they were left unprovisioned and far from their homeland. I gave them the oath, that they should give up their violence and travel back to their homelands, understanding that the way would be difficult, but that they would be unhindered by the Order if they stayed true to their oath. Each one agreed."[PARAGRAPH:1]The Confessor wrote the details in a tome; when the trial was finished, it would be packaged carefully and delivered to the Cynosure of Junil. When he was done writing he methodically intoned, "What we three decide shall become law, let no one break it. Ask the question."[PARAGRAPH:1]He glared at Valin when he said three, unwilling to change his script to account for him, as if his conviction of the sanctity of the trial would keep Valin from being able to witness it.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rosier continued, "Will the Twisted men keep their oath?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The Diviner considered Rosier carefully. The old Diviner would pray here, maybe walk around the room, speak to Junil in angelic languages. But this Diviner, she only sat staring at Rosier. Then she spoke.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What do you think?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The Confessor just about exploded. He couldn't say anything, it wasn't his turn to speak, but he turned white, and then red, and then back to white again. In his horror, he even dripped ink on the tome, and took it to be a sure sign from Junil that everyone in the room was going to be destroyed.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Me?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, Rosier, what do you think?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"The Osul can't support much life, and the twisted men aren't competent hunters. Many will starve before they get back to their home. After serving the Burnt Priest, they can't expect to receive any charity from what few people live in that area. Faced with death or the threat of death, most will choose the threat and break their Oath."[PARAGRAPH:1]"What causes men to break oaths?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Rosier was unprepared for the question, unaccustomed to being asked questions at all; that wasn't the nature of the Order. He thought about it.[PARAGRAPH:1]"A lot of things, greed, anger, lust. Something as minor as a desire to act unlawfully to something as big as a belief that the person is greater than the oath he made. There are probably as many different reasons as there are men."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Valin, what causes men to break oaths?"[PARAGRAPH:1]It was either so clear in his mind-or he was attempting to keep the Confessor from passing out-either way, he answered in one word, "Weakness."[PARAGRAPH:1]The Diviner considered again then seemed to come back to the trial.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Most of the Twisted men will break their oath. They will attempt to attack a village called Hallowell in 3 nights. Take a company of Oath-takers and wait for them there. Some of the Twisted men won't join the raid and will continue on, do not hinder them."[PARAGRAPH:1]Everyone in the room looked at the Confessor. He wasn't writing, he seemed confused on what to record and what to exclude as the Diviner's rambling. He hastily noted the Diviner's decision and intoned, "What we three decide shall become law, let no one break it."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rosier kneeled again and said his line, "I will carry out this duty, and pledge my life to this task and to Junil. This is my oath."[PARAGRAPH:1]The Diviner watched without expression. Rosier rose and left the room, Valin falling in behind him. Before Valin was out of the door, the Diviner called for him. Valin stepped back in and closed the door.[PARAGRAPH:1]"We have another trial to perform," said the Diviner.[PARAGRAPH:1]Valin looked at the Confessor, both equally confused. "I witnessed no oaths today."[PARAGRAPH:1]"You just did, and we will need to perform a trial on it."</English>

		<German>Es waren vier Personen in der Kammer - gemäß Tradition sollten es aber nur drei sein, und für den Orden war es äußerst ungewöhnlich mit der Tradition zu brechen. Der runde Raum hatte ein gewölbtes Dach mit einem Mosaik von Lord Sabathiel. Es war spät und man konnte die Abendgebete aus dem Altarraum hallen hören.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rosier kniete auf dem Boden, er war ein Schwurbewahrer und hier, um über die Einhaltung eines Eids zu berichten. Schwurbewahrer hatten zwei Aufgaben: Eide zu bezeugen und diejenigen zu bestrafen, die sie brachen. Wie üblich war auch diesmal ein Bekenner anwesend. Bekenner extrahierten Informationen, sie waren die Augen und Ohren des Ordens. Und sie dienten als Zeugen und führten bei Gericht Protokoll. Der letzte üblicherweise bei Gericht vertretene Teilnehmer war ein Wahrsager. Wahrsager waren in der Lage zu sagen, ob ein Eid, der im Namen Junils geschworen wurde, gebrochen wird oder nicht.[PARAGRAPH:1]Was Rosier die Zornesröte ins Gesicht trieb war, dass die anwesende Wahrsagerin darauf bestand, dass eine vierte Person dem Treffen beiwohnen sollte: ein weiterer Schwurbewahrer, Valin Phanuel. Valin stand abseits bei der Tür, unschlüssig was er tun sollte. Das Gericht hat (wie alle Dinge, die der Orden tat) eine sehr Präzise Abfolge. Es war eine Zeremonie für drei Personen, und nur die Wahrsagerin schien keine Probleme dabei zu haben, diese Formalität zu brechen. Sie begann.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Erhebt Euch Rosier, Ritter des zweiten Herzens, Schwurbewahrer und Unerreichter."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rosier erhob sich und wiederholte die Antwort, die er auch schon unzählige male zuvor gegeben hatte: "Ich bin das Schild bis das Schwert gezogen wird, ich bin der Hüter des Gesetzes bis mein Herr mir einhalt gebietet, ich bin der Bewahrer des Friedens, bis der Eid gebrochen wird."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Welchen Eid bringst Du mir, Kind?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Diese Wahrsagerin war neu und eine Frau, was ungewöhnlich war. Der ehemalige Wahrsager der Abtei ist aus unbekannten Gründen abberufen worden. Dieses war das erste Mal, das Rosier die neue Wahrsagerin traf, aber er hatte schon von ihrem ungewöhnlichen Verhalten gehört, welches sowohl den Bekenner als auch viele andere verärgerte. Rosier verdrängte diese Gedanken und konzentrierte sich auf den Grund, aus dem er hier war.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Im Osul-Gebirge wurde eine kleine Gruppe unredlicher Männer gefangengenommen. Sie hatten dem verbrannten Priester gedient. Aber nach seinen Tod und ohne die von ihm beschworenen Legionen waren sie unversorgt und fern ihrer Heimat. Ich nahm ihnen einen Eid ab, dass sie ohne Anwendung von Gewalt in Ihre Heimat zurückreisen würden - in dem Wissen, dass der Weg zwar schwer werden würde, aber dass Sie nicht von dem Orden behelligt würden, solange Sie ihr Wort nicht brachen. Alle stimmten zu."[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Bekenner schrieb die Details in ein Buch, welches nach dem Prozess vorsichtig versiegelt und zum Anziehungspunkt von Junil überbracht werden würde. Als er zuende geschrieben hatte rezitierte er methodisch: "Was wir drei beschliessen soll Gesetz werden, niemand soll es brechen. Stellt die Frage."[PARAGRAPH:1]Er blickte zu Valin, als er "drei" sagte - nicht gewillt seinen Text seinetwegen abzuändern, als ob sein Festhalten an den Traditionen des Prozesses Valin daran hindern würde, ebenfalls als Zeuge beizuwohnen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rosier fuhr fort: "Werden die Männer ihren Eid einhalten?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Wahrsagerin bedachte Rosier sorgfältig. Der alte Wahrsager hätte in diesem Moment angefangen zu beten, eventuell wäre er durch den Raum gelaufen und hätte in Engelchören zu Junil gesprochen. Diese Wahrsagerin blieb jedoch still sitzen und starrte Rosier an. Dann sprach sie..[PARAGRAPH:1]"Was glaubt ihr?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Bekenner war kurz davor zu explodieren. Er konnte und würde nichts sagen, er war nicht an der Reihe. Aber seine Gesichtsfarbe wechselte von kalkweiss zu knallrot und wieder zurück. Zu seinem Entsetzten tropfte sogar Tinte auf das Buch und er sah dies als sicheres Zeichen Junils, dass jeder in dem Raum vernichtet werden würde.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ja Rosier, was glaubt ihr?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Der Osul ist sehr unwirtlich und die Männer sind keine fähigen Jäger. Viele werden verhungern, bevor sie ihre Heimat erreichen. Nachdem sie dem verbrannten Priester gedient haben können Sie keine Almosen von den wenigen Leuten erwarten, die in dieser Gegend leben. Im Angesicht des sicheren Todes gegenüber der bloßen Drohung des Todes wegen Eidbruchs werden die meisten Männer sich für die Drohung entscheiden und ihren Eid brechen."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Was bringt Menschen dazu, ihren Eid zu brechen?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Rosier war nicht auf diese Frage vorbereitet, nicht daran gewohnt überhaupt befragt zu werden. Dies war nicht die Natur des Ordens. Er dachte über die Frage nach.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Viele Dinge - Gier, Wut,  Lust. Manchmal einfach nur das Verlangen, gegen das Gesetz zu verstoßen. Ein anderes Mal ist es der Glaube, man stehe über dem Eid den man machte. Es gibt wahrscheinlich genauso viele verschiedene Gründe, wie es Menschen gibt."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Valin, was bringt Menschen dazu, ihren Eid zu brechen?".[PARAGRAPH:1]Es war entweder so klar in seinen Gedanken - oder er wollte einfach nur verhindern, dass der Bekenner ohnmächtig wurde - er antwortete direkt und nur mit einem Wort: "Schwäche".[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Wahrsagerin überlegte erneut und folgte danach wieder dem Prozess.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Die meisten der Männer werden ihren Eid brechen. Sie werden in drei Nächten einen Ort Namens Hallowell angreifen. Nehmt eine Kompanie Schwurbewahrer und wartet dort auf sie. Einige werden hingegen weiterziehen und nicht an dem Angriff teilnehmen, behelligt diese nicht weiter."[PARAGRAPH:1]Alle in dem Raum schauten nun zu dem Bekenner, da er nicht schrieb. Er wirkte zu verwirrt, was er aufschreiben und was er auslassen sollte. Als er sich der Aufmerksamkeit bewusst wurde schrieb er hastig die Entscheidung der Wahrsagerin auf und sagte: "Was wir Drei beschließen soll Gesetz sein, niemand soll es brechen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rosier kniete erneut und sagte seinen Spruch: "Ich Gelobe bei meinem Leben diese Tat im Namen Junils auszuführen. Dies soll mein Schwur sein."[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Wahrsagerin schaute ausdruckslos drein. Rosier erhob sich und verließ den Raum. Valin folgte ihm. Bevor Valin durch die Tür treten konnte, rief die Wahrsagerin ihn zurück. Valin trat zurück in den Raum und schloß die Tür.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Wir haben einen weiteren Prozess zu führen", sagte die Wahrsagerin.[PARAGRAPH:1]Valin schaute den Bekenner an, beide waren gleichauf verwirrt. "Ich wohnte heute keinem Eid bei."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Doch, grade eben - und wir müssen einen Prozess darüber halten."</German>
		<Italian>There were four in the chamber-tradition said there should only be three, and it wasn't like the Order to break tradition. The room was round with a domed ceiling and a mosaic of Lord Sabathiel on it. It was late, and the evening prayers could be heard echoing from the sanctuary.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rosier knelt on the floor; he was an Oath-taker here to report on an oath he had exacted. The Oath-takers served two roles: exacting oaths, and punishing those that broke them. As was typical, there was also a Confessor here. The Confessors extracted information, they were the eyes and the ears of the Order, and they served as a witness and record keeper for these trials. The last normal member of the trial was a Diviner. A Diviner was able to tell if any Oath made in Junil's name would be broken or not.[PARAGRAPH:1]What had Rosier flush with anger was the Diviner's instances on having a fourth person at the meeting: a fellow Oath-taker, Valin Phanuel. Valin stood back by the door, unsure of what to do. The trial (like all things the Order did) had very precise steps. It was a ceremony for three people, and only the Diviner seemed comfortable breaking that. She started.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Arise Rosier, Knight of the 2nd Heart, Oath-taker and Nonpareil."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rosier stood and repeated the phrase, as he had many times before, "I am the shield till the sword comes free, I am a bearer of the law until my lord gives me rest, I am a keeper of peace until the oath is broken."[PARAGRAPH:1]"What oath do you bring me, child?"[PARAGRAPH:1]This Diviner was new, a woman, which was unusual. The former Diviner of the Abbey had been called back, the reason unknown. This was the first time Rosier had met the new Diviner, but he had heard that her unusual behavior had infuriated more than just the Abbey Confessor. Rosier pushed those thoughts back and focused on the reason he was here.[PARAGRAPH:1]"At the Osul mountains, a small company of Twisted men were captured. They had served the Burnt Priest, but with him dead and his summoned legions gone, they were left unprovisioned and far from their homeland. I gave them the oath, that they should give up their violence and travel back to their homelands, understanding that the way would be difficult, but that they would be unhindered by the Order if they stayed true to their oath. Each one agreed."[PARAGRAPH:1]The Confessor wrote the details in a tome; when the trial was finished, it would be packaged carefully and delivered to the Cynosure of Junil. When he was done writing he methodically intoned, "What we three decide shall become law, let no one break it. Ask the question."[PARAGRAPH:1]He glared at Valin when he said three, unwilling to change his script to account for him, as if his conviction of the sanctity of the trial would keep Valin from being able to witness it.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rosier continued, "Will the Twisted men keep their oath?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The Diviner considered Rosier carefully. The old Diviner would pray here, maybe walk around the room, speak to Junil in angelic languages. But this Diviner, she only sat staring at Rosier. Then she spoke.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What do you think?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The Confessor just about exploded. He couldn't say anything, it wasn't his turn to speak, but he turned white, and then red, and then back to white again. In his horror, he even dripped ink on the tome, and took it to be a sure sign from Junil that everyone in the room was going to be destroyed.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Me?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, Rosier, what do you think?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"The Osul can't support much life, and the twisted men aren't competent hunters. Many will starve before they get back to their home. After serving the Burnt Priest, they can't expect to receive any charity from what few people live in that area. Faced with death or the threat of death, most will choose the threat and break their Oath."[PARAGRAPH:1]"What causes men to break oaths?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Rosier was unprepared for the question, unaccustomed to being asked questions at all; that wasn't the nature of the Order. He thought about it.[PARAGRAPH:1]"A lot of things, greed, anger, lust. Something as minor as a desire to act unlawfully to something as big as a belief that the person is greater than the oath he made. There are probably as many different reasons as there are men."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Valin, what causes men to break oaths?"[PARAGRAPH:1]It was either so clear in his mind-or he was attempting to keep the Confessor from passing out-either way, he answered in one word, "Weakness."[PARAGRAPH:1]The Diviner considered again then seemed to come back to the trial.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Most of the Twisted men will break their oath. They will attempt to attack a village called Hallowell in 3 nights. Take a company of Oath-takers and wait for them there. Some of the Twisted men won't join the raid and will continue on, do not hinder them."[PARAGRAPH:1]Everyone in the room looked at the Confessor. He wasn't writing, he seemed confused on what to record and what to exclude as the Diviner's rambling. He hastily noted the Diviner's decision and intoned, "What we three decide shall become law, let no one break it."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rosier kneeled again and said his line, "I will carry out this duty, and pledge my life to this task and to Junil. This is my oath."[PARAGRAPH:1]The Diviner watched without expression. Rosier rose and left the room, Valin falling in behind him. Before Valin was out of the door, the Diviner called for him. Valin stepped back in and closed the door.[PARAGRAPH:1]"We have another trial to perform," said the Diviner.[PARAGRAPH:1]Valin looked at the Confessor, both equally confused. "I witnessed no oaths today."[PARAGRAPH:1]"You just did, and we will need to perform a trial on it."</Italian>

		<English>The old captain reluctantly rose from his seat at the cabin, where he had been perusing his collection of maps. They had arrived, one of the crew had told him in a rather shaken voice. He was not at all comfortable with the situation, but he knew that he must not show it, or even think of it. They could sense that kind of thing, he had heard, and while not superstitious, he nevertheless was a careful man, the evidence of which being the fact that he had managed to become so old despite his dangerous profession.[PARAGRAPH:1]As he came up on deck, he noticed that the afternoon sun had given way to foggy twilight. He must have been in the cabin for longer than he thought, though a small voice in the back of his mind told him that it was because of their presence. He resolved to ignore the voice, but he feared it was going to become more insistent soon. He'd better get these negotiations over with quickly, hopefully he would receive the reward without trouble, and be able to head home to Selena as soon as possible. The small voice laughed at this thought, but it was a bitter and humorless laughter tinged with desperation.[PARAGRAPH:1]He saw their ship anchored next to theirs, he saw the plank that had provided a makeshift bridge, and finally his eyes fell upon the dark silhouette standing on the deck before him, with a few smaller ones scattered behind.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Good evening, captain. It is truly a nice ship you've got here."[PARAGRAPH:1]The voice was warm and friendly in a slightly disturbing sort of way, a little bit like the warm and friendly voice of a predator luring its prey, the small voice commented. The figure made a gesture with what the captain fervently hoped was its arm, apparently meant simply to indicate the ship, but somehow managing to appear much more ominous. By the overlords, this was unsettling! Then, a bit too late to be proper etiquette, he realized that he was expected to say something.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Y-yes, thank you. Reputedly the best ship in the fleet, we are...."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Of course you are. We chose you for the mission. Because your ship was chosen by Us, it follows logically that it is the best. We do not make mistakes. Thus it is and thus it always will be. Tell us of your mission."[PARAGRAPH:1]The captain was momentarily baffled at the way the tone of voice so quickly changed from alluring to commanding, but he could do nothing but obey. In a voice more stuttering in actuality than the captain believed it to be, he recounted the story of the past week. Of how they had sailed with the rest of the fleet to lead the final attack. Of how the fleet had sailed through hidden canals and shallow rivers to take the city by surprise. Of how the captain and his crew had, the night before the fleet reached the city, stealthily left the fleet to sail ahead and warn the city of the attack, betraying the positions of the other ships. Of how soldiers from the city had rushed to the ships' position under cover of darkness, destroying them and massacring their unprepared crews with ease.[PARAGRAPH:1]As the tale progressed, the captain felt increasingly uncomfortable, and it must have been evident on his face, because the dark figure replied:[PARAGRAPH:1]"Do not trouble yourself with meaningless guilt, captain. When We first approached you, We offered you a choice between death and life. You chose life. Life at the expense of many deaths, deaths of friends and allies perhaps, but life nonetheless. It was the rational choice. It is the choice We would have made. Given the circumstances, yes, it was the right choice. You couldn't have known, after all..."[PARAGRAPH:1]The captain at first felt comforted by this, but then he suddenly heard the last sentence again in his mind, and a great feeling of horror overcame him.[PARAGRAPH:1]"No...no...please...no..."he moaned[PARAGRAPH:1]"You did not know that the choice We offered to you was not in fact a choice between life and death, but rather a choice between loyalty and betrayal. What We knew and you did not was that death would follow in either case. As We previously said, We do not make mistakes. Letting you live would be a mistake."[PARAGRAPH:1]"No...NO! You promised...you promised...what have I done...?" The captain was sobbing now. [PARAGRAPH:1]"An amusing comment. A betrayer should know better than to hold others to their word, We find."[PARAGRAPH:1]The dark figure took a staff that had been hanging on its back, and proceeded to ram it straight downwards into the ship, ignoring the sobbing captain. A flash of darkish purple light shone, and when the captain looked up again through his tear-filled eyes, They had vanished, along with their ship, leaving an enormous hole straight through the vessel, which was quickly starting to take in water. As the rest of the crew rushed about on the ship, panicking and making feeble attempts at saving themselves, the captain merely sat on his knees in front of the crack, thinking of the lives he had destroyed, thinking of Selena, thinking of his folly, all the while longing for the waves that would end his suffering.[PARAGRAPH:1]As They knew then, and he did not, the suffering of him and his crew was not, in fact, about to end. It was about to begin.</English>

		<German>Nur ungern erhob sich der alte Kapitän von seinem Sitz in der Kabine, wo er seine Karten durchgesehen hatte. Sie waren angekommen, einer der Crew hatte es ihm mit zitternder Stimme gesagt. Er war gar nicht mit der Situation zufrieden, aber er durfte es nicht zeigen, noch nicht mal daran denken. Er hatte gehört, dass Sie solche Dinge erspüren könnten und obwohl er nicht abergläubisch war, war er ein vorsichtiger Mann. Deswegen hatte er trotz seines gefährlichen Berufes schon so lange überlebt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Als er an Deck kam, war die Nachmittagssonne einen nebeligen Zwielicht gewichen. Er muss länger in der Kabine gewesen sein, dachte er, aber eine leise Stimme in seinem Hinterkopf flüsterte, dass es an Ihrer Anwesenheit läge. Er entschloss sich, die Stimme zu ignorieren, aber er fürchtete, sie würde bald eindringlicher werden. Besser er würde die Verhandlung schnell über die Bühne bringen und hoffentlich den Lohn ohne Probleme erhalten, um endlich nach Selena heimkehren zu können. Die leise Stimme lachte bei diesem Gedanken, aber es war ein hartes, freudloses Lachen vermischt mit einer Spur Verzweiflung.[PARAGRAPH:1]Er sah, dass Ihr Schiff nahe dem seinen vor Anker lag; er sah die Planke, die als behelfsmäßige Brücke diente und schließlich fiel sein Blick auf die dunkle Silhouette, die vor ihm auf dem Deck stand sowie ein paar weiteren dahinter.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Guten Abend, Kapitän. Ein wirklich schönes Schiff habt Ihr da."[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Stimme war warm und freundlich in einer leicht verstörenden Art, ein wenig wie die warme und freundliche Stimme des Jägers, der seine Beute anlockt, kommentierte die leise Stimme. Die Gestalt machte eine Geste mit dem, was der Kapitän inbrünstig hoffte, dass es dessen Arm sei. Offensichtlich galt sie dem Schiff, aber irgendwie wirkte sie unheilverkündend. Bei den Schatten der Tiefe, war das aufreibend! Dann bemerkte er - etwas zu spät - dass von ihm eine Antwort erwartet wurde. [PARAGRAPH:1]"J-ja, danke. Angeblich haben wir das beste Schiff der Flotte ..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Natürlich habt Ihr das. Es wurde für die Mission ausgewählt. Eben weil es von uns erwählt wurde, muss es logischerweise das Beste sein. "Wir machen keine Fehler. Erzählt uns von der Mission."[PARAGRAPH:1]Für einen Moment war der Kapitän verblüfft, wie schnell sich die verführerische Stimme in einen Kommandierton verwandelte, aber er musste gehorchen. Mit zitternder Stimme, die stärker zitterte als der Kapitän glaubte, erzählte er die letzten Wochen nach. Wie sie mit der restlichen Flotte gesegelt waren, um den finalen Angriff zu führen. Davon wie sie durch verborgene Kanäle und flache Flüsse gefahren waren, um die Stadt zu überraschen. Davon, wie der Kapitän und seine Crew, kurz bevor die Flotte die Stadt erreichte, sich heimlich von der Flotte absetzten, um die Stadt vor dem bevorstehenden Angriff zu warnen und die er Position der anderen Schiffe verriet. Wie die Soldaten der Stadt schnell im Schutze der Dunkelheit zu den Schiffen vordrangen und deren unvorbereitete Besatzungen dahinmetzelten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Je mehr er erzählte, desto unwohler fühlte sich der Kapitän und es muss ihm anzusehen gewesen sein, denn die dunkle Gestalt antwortete: [PARAGRAPH:1]"Belastet Euch nicht mit nutzloser Schuld, Kapitän. Als Wir Euch zum ersten Mal trafen, boten Wir Euch die Wahl zwischen Leben und Tod. Ihr habt Euch für das Leben entschieden. Leben im Gegenzug für viele Tote, den Tod von Freunden, Alliierte vielleicht, aber trotzdem Leben. Es war eine rationale Wahl. Genauso hätten Wir auch entschieden. Unter den gegebenen Umständen war es die richtige Wahl. Ihr konntet es nicht besser wissen, letzten Endes...[PARAGRAPH:1]Zuerst fühlte sich der Kapitän beruhigt. Aber dann ertönte der letzte Satz noch mal in seinem Kopf und große Furcht überkam ihn. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Nein...nein...bitte, nein..." jammerte er.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ihr wusstet nicht, dass die angebotene Wahl nicht eine Wahl zwischen Leben und Tod war, sondern eher eine Wahl zwischen Loyalität und Verrat. Was Wir wussten und Ihr nicht, ist, dass der Tod in jedem Falle folgen würde. Wie Wir schon sagten, wir machen keine Fehler. Und Euch am Leben zu lassen wäre ein Fehler." [PARAGRAPH:1]"Nein...NEIN! Ihr habt versprochen...versprochen...was habe ich getan?" Der Kapitän schluchzte. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Sehr amüsant! Ein Verräter sollte es besser wissen, als andere an ihr Wort zu erinnern, meinen Wir." [PARAGRAPH:1]Die dunkle Gestalt nahm einen Stab, der auf seinem Rücken hing und rammte ihn geradewegs in das Schiff, ohne den jammernden Kapitän zu beachten. Ein tief violetter Blitz leuchtete auf und als der Kapitän mit Tränen in den Augen aufschaute, waren Sie mit ihrem Schiff verschwunden. Sie ließen ein großes Loch mitten durch den Schiffskörper zurück, durch welches schnell Wasser eindrang. Während der Rest der Crew panisch über Deck rannte und schwache Versuche der Selbstrettung unternahm, kniete der Kapitän vor dem Riss, dachte an die Leben, die er vernichtet hatte, dachte an Selena, an seine Dummheit und wartete, dass die Wellen ein Ende mit ihm machen würden. [PARAGRAPH:1]Aber Sie wussten, was er nicht wusste: seine Crew und er standen nicht am Ende ihres Leidensweges. Sie standen an seinem Anfang.</German>
		<Italian>The old captain reluctantly rose from his seat at the cabin, where he had been perusing his collection of maps. They had arrived, one of the crew had told him in a rather shaken voice. He was not at all comfortable with the situation, but he knew that he must not show it, or even think of it. They could sense that kind of thing, he had heard, and while not superstitious, he nevertheless was a careful man, the evidence of which being the fact that he had managed to become so old despite his dangerous profession.[PARAGRAPH:1]As he came up on deck, he noticed that the afternoon sun had given way to foggy twilight. He must have been in the cabin for longer than he thought, though a small voice in the back of his mind told him that it was because of their presence. He resolved to ignore the voice, but he feared it was going to become more insistent soon. He'd better get these negotiations over with quickly, hopefully he would receive the reward without trouble, and be able to head home to Selena as soon as possible. The small voice laughed at this thought, but it was a bitter and humorless laughter tinged with desperation.[PARAGRAPH:1]He saw their ship anchored next to theirs, he saw the plank that had provided a makeshift bridge, and finally his eyes fell upon the dark silhouette standing on the deck before him, with a few smaller ones scattered behind.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Good evening, captain. It is truly a nice ship you've got here."[PARAGRAPH:1]The voice was warm and friendly in a slightly disturbing sort of way, a little bit like the warm and friendly voice of a predator luring its prey, the small voice commented. The figure made a gesture with what the captain fervently hoped was its arm, apparently meant simply to indicate the ship, but somehow managing to appear much more ominous. By the overlords, this was unsettling! Then, a bit too late to be proper etiquette, he realized that he was expected to say something.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Y-yes, thank you. Reputedly the best ship in the fleet, we are...."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Of course you are. We chose you for the mission. Because your ship was chosen by Us, it follows logically that it is the best. We do not make mistakes. Thus it is and thus it always will be. Tell us of your mission."[PARAGRAPH:1]The captain was momentarily baffled at the way the tone of voice so quickly changed from alluring to commanding, but he could do nothing but obey. In a voice more stuttering in actuality than the captain believed it to be, he recounted the story of the past week. Of how they had sailed with the rest of the fleet to lead the final attack. Of how the fleet had sailed through hidden canals and shallow rivers to take the city by surprise. Of how the captain and his crew had, the night before the fleet reached the city, stealthily left the fleet to sail ahead and warn the city of the attack, betraying the positions of the other ships. Of how soldiers from the city had rushed to the ships' position under cover of darkness, destroying them and massacring their unprepared crews with ease.[PARAGRAPH:1]As the tale progressed, the captain felt increasingly uncomfortable, and it must have been evident on his face, because the dark figure replied:[PARAGRAPH:1]"Do not trouble yourself with meaningless guilt, captain. When We first approached you, We offered you a choice between death and life. You chose life. Life at the expense of many deaths, deaths of friends and allies perhaps, but life nonetheless. It was the rational choice. It is the choice We would have made. Given the circumstances, yes, it was the right choice. You couldn't have known, after all..."[PARAGRAPH:1]The captain at first felt comforted by this, but then he suddenly heard the last sentence again in his mind, and a great feeling of horror overcame him.[PARAGRAPH:1]"No...no...please...no..."he moaned[PARAGRAPH:1]"You did not know that the choice We offered to you was not in fact a choice between life and death, but rather a choice between loyalty and betrayal. What We knew and you did not was that death would follow in either case. As We previously said, We do not make mistakes. Letting you live would be a mistake."[PARAGRAPH:1]"No...NO! You promised...you promised...what have I done...?" The captain was sobbing now. [PARAGRAPH:1]"An amusing comment. A betrayer should know better than to hold others to their word, We find."[PARAGRAPH:1]The dark figure took a staff that had been hanging on its back, and proceeded to ram it straight downwards into the ship, ignoring the sobbing captain. A flash of darkish purple light shone, and when the captain looked up again through his tear-filled eyes, They had vanished, along with their ship, leaving an enormous hole straight through the vessel, which was quickly starting to take in water. As the rest of the crew rushed about on the ship, panicking and making feeble attempts at saving themselves, the captain merely sat on his knees in front of the crack, thinking of the lives he had destroyed, thinking of Selena, thinking of his folly, all the while longing for the waves that would end his suffering.[PARAGRAPH:1]As They knew then, and he did not, the suffering of him and his crew was not, in fact, about to end. It was about to begin.</Italian>

Blood sprayed over opponents, and every swing would lose more and more of the corpse, until another was needed to replace the first.

		<German>[TAB]Die Doviello gehen mit rohen Waffen in die Schlacht, einen Wurfstein, größer als ein Menschenkopf oder starken Knüppel. Sie benutzen diese behelfsmäßigen Waffen, weil sie sie nur kurz brauchen. Der erste getötete Gegner wird zur nächsten Waffe. An den Knöcheln gepackt, wird daraus ein fleischiger Dreschflegel. Blut bespritzt die Gegner und mit jedem Ausholen verliert der Körper immer mehr Teile, bis er schließlich durch einen neuen ersetzt werden muss. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt der Schlacht sind diese "Waffen" jedoch leicht verfügbar. Gelegentlich lebt ein Gegner noch, wenn er gepackt wird. Der Effekt, von einem blutigen Körper getroffen zu werden, der dabei schreit, verstört selbst den abgehärtetsten Krieger. Nur wenige Armeen wollen den Doviello entgegentreten, auch wenn es nur ein paar hundert sind.[PARAGRAPH:1]Saverous war ein Krieger der Doviello, der vom Gebrannten Priester gefangen und in eine Versuchsanstalt gebracht wurde, um eine Reihe von Experimenten an ihm durchzuführen. Dort wäre er gestorben, oder noch schlimmer, monatelang dahin vegetiert, aber ein Krieg brach aus. Die Schatten der Tiefe suchten unter ihren Sklaven nach benutzbaren Körpern, Krieger wurden geopfert und Priester wurden zum Kampf gezwungen. Saverous war fast zwei Meter hoch und sein Körper hatte noch Kraft, obwohl sein Geist durch die Experimente gebrochen war. So verwandelten sie ihn in einen Thrull.[PARAGRAPH:1]Besessen von einem Dämon und beschrieben mit Runen, die seine Haut härten und seine Muskeln stärken, wurde Saverous auf dem Schlachtfeld losgelassen. Arawn kümmert sich nun um jedem, der ihm im Weg stand</German>

		<English>There are many reasons young men chose to risk their life exploring unknown lands. Some do it to prove their loyalty or prowess. Some are outlaws, serving penance for crimes. Many do it simply to satisfy a craving for adventure. It is a dangerous life, and few return from the wilderness, but the rewards are rich for the few who come back alive. Scouts who do return carry tales and bounty from the lost ruins of ancient cities, or the souvenirs of slain beasts, or knowledge of new land ripe for colonization. In exchange, they are lavished with gifts; women, land, titles, money, pardon for crimes committed. Some of the greatest noble families of the Fourth Age are the descendants of these early explorers.</English>

		<German>Es gibt viele Gründe, weshalb junge Männer das Risiko eingehen, unbekannte Landstriche zu erkunden. Manche tun das, um ihre Loyalität oder ihre Tapferkeit unter Beweis zu stellen. Einige sind Gesetzlose, die Buße für Verbrechen üben. Viele tun es einfach, um ihren Hunger nach Abenteuer zu stillen. Es ist ein gefährliches Leben und nur wenige kehren aus der Wildnis zurück, aber die wenigen Rückkehrer werden reich belohnt. Zurückkehrende Späher bringen Geschichten von Ruinen längst vergangener Städte mit, oder Souvenirs von getöteten Bestien, oder das Wissen über neues Land, dessen Besiedelung sich lohnen wird. Im Austausch werden sie mit Geschenken, Frauen, Land, Titeln, Geld oder Vergebung von Straftaten überhäuft. Einige der größten Adelsfamilien des Vierten Zeitalters sind die Nachkommen dieser frühen Späher.</German>

		<English>The room was perfectly formed: identical grey tiles covered the floor and fluted columns were evenly spaced throughout the hall. Angels knelt or were seated according to their rank, which was also reflected in their dress, although the differences were often too slight for mortal eyes to recognize. In fact, the perfection of the chamber, from the exact proportions down to each fold in every angels robe, was so off-putting to mortal eyes that even the most precise couldn't help feeling like he threw the room, or the entire heaven, out of balance by his very existence.[PARAGRAPH:1]Junil stood in the center of the chamber unwavering. Words and reports were unnecessary, there was no outward sign of stress or panic, yet every angel's focus was on the same event: sacred ground was being desecrated. It was the Seven Pines, the place that the Compact was signed. It was sacred to many gods, but Junil had committed to keeping the area safe before the gods had agreed to the Compact, to ensure that the Gods and their emissaries could meet there safely, and now that oath wasn't being kept.[PARAGRAPH:1]It was the Compact itself that caused the problem, it stated that the gods and angels couldn't intervene directly with the affairs of men, instead they had to work through them by various limited and archaic means, none of which helped in this situation. Those loyal to Junil had been killed, struck down quickly through a form of stealth that obscured even the sight of the angelic watchers.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the Seven Pines, there were symbols for each of the gods that existed at the time of the Compact. The Svartalfar were stealing the symbols, all those except the symbol of their own god, Esus. Junil's symbol was a sword and shield that hung from one of the trees in the glade. A Svartalfar assassin went to claim the symbol as a personal trophy.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sphener broke the perfection of the room and stood. The angel opposite him, who was supposed to mirror his movements in every ritualized action, seemed confused. Was he supposed to follow, was this some ritual he had forgotten or was Sphener breaking the laws of the chamber? Other angels in the chamber, including Sphener's own lord, allowed a brief crease of annoyance to cross their foreheads to show their extreme disapproval of Sphener's action. Junil showed no reaction.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sphener crossed the perfect floor and kneeled before the god of law. He spoke, following the tradition of the few mortals that had come here to petition Junil, as an angel had never done so before.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Great lord, allow me to keep your promise and protect the Seven Pines. Cast me from the vault, take from me the divine essence and have me reborn mortal such that my actions will not break the Compact and both oaths will remain fulfilled."[PARAGRAPH:1]Junil turned his eyes to the prostrate lesser angel. His hesitation was not from concern, but from a consideration of the possible outcomes: would Sphener be able to defend the Pines, was Sphener more useful in creation than he was in heaven, was there another way to maintain both oaths, what would keep the same event from occurring again? Junil turned his focus on the Svartalfar attackers and decided that Sphener could defeat them; the laws were clear, if an angel wished to fall, he could.[PARAGRAPH:1]Junil responded with only one word, "Approved", and Sphener was gone from the chamber.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Svartalfar assassin smiled as he considered his own reflection in the sword's gleaming blade. The sword was too heavy and long for him but it would sell for a lifetime's wages. Then the sword was yanked out of his hands, he spun expecting to see one of his companions and found himself staring into the breastplate of an 8-foot-tall angel instead.[PARAGRAPH:1]The sword was functional as well as ornamental and Sphener cut him down. Like a scythe through grain, Sphener set on the rest, they were killed quickly, but it took longer for Sphener to replace all of the artifacts and remove any trace that they had been there from the Pines. When it was finally complete, he knelt and prayed.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Sphener ended his prayer, the Pines were gone; Junil had removed it from creation to keep it safe. All that was left behind was the sword and shield. Sphener took them and headed into the woods. He had long been curious about creation and looked forward to serving Junil in this new role.</English>

All that was left behind was the sword and shield. Sphener took them and headed into the woods. He had long been curious about creation and looked forward to serving Junil in this new role.</French>
		<German>Der Raum war perfekt geformt: identische graue Fliesen bedeckten den Fußboden und gerillte Stützpfeiler waren gleichmäßig in der Halle verteilt. Engel knieten oder saßen hier je nach ihrem Rang, den ein geübteres Auge als das sterblicher auch an der Kleidung hätte erkennen können. Die Perfektion des Raumes, von ihren exakten Proportionen bis hin zu jeder einzelnen Falte in den Roben, war so komplett, dass ein Fremder hier sich so fühlen musste als ob er diesen Raum, oder den gesamten Himmel gar durch seine bloße Existenz entweihe.[PARAGRAPH:1]Junil stand im Zemtrum dieser Kammer. Wörter waren hier fehl am Platze, es gab kein Zeichen von Anspannung oder gar Panik und trotzdem lag die Aufmerksamkeit eines jeden Engels beim selben Ereignis: heiliger Boden wurde geschändet! Es waren die Sieben Fichten, der Ort an dem der Pakt unterzeichnet wurde. Er war den meisten Göttern heilig, Junil persönlich hatte sich für die Sicherheit dieses Ortes sogar verbürgt, bevor die Götter dem Pakt überhaupt zugestimmt hatten, als einen Ort an dem sich die Götter und die Götterboten sicher treffen konnten - und nun konnte er diesen Schwur nicht mehr halten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das Problem wurde durch den Pakt selbst erzeugt. Er verbot nämlich, dass die Götter und Engel sich direkt in die Geschicke der Menschen einmischen dürfen; Sie mussten sich vielmehr mit primitiven und limitierten Mitteln behelfen, von denen ihnen keines in dieser Situation hilfreich war. Einige derer, die loyal zu Junil standen waren schon getötet worden. Erschlagen von einem getarnten Gegner, der so schnell zuschlug, dass ihn nicht einmal die  himmlischen Wächter wahrnehmen konnten. [PARAGRAPH:1]In den Sieben Fichten waren Artefakte eines jeden Gottes der zur Zeit des Paktes existierte präsent. Die Svartalfar waren dabei sie zu stehlen, alle außer denen eines bestimmten Gottes - ihres Gottes - Esus. Junil's Artefakte waren ein Schwert und ein Schild das an einem der Bäume auf der Lichtung hing. Ein Meuchelmörder der Svartalfar  war schon dabei dieses Artefakt für den Diebstahl zu verstauen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sphener störte plötzlich die Perfektion des Raumes und erhob sich. Der ihm gegenübersitzende Engel war verwirrt, sollte er sich jetzt auch erheben? War dies ein Ritual das er nicht kannte oder vergessen hatte, oder brach Sphener gerade das Gesetz der Kammer? Andere Engel, unter ihnen auch Spheners Herr, zeigten sogar ein extremes Signal des Mißfallens ob dieser Störung Spheners, ihre Stirn legte sich in Falten. Junil selbst zeigte keine Reaktion.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sphener durchquerte die Halle und kniete vor Junil nieder. Er sprach, ganz wie es zuvor schon die wenigen sterblichen den alten Traditionen folgend taten um Bitten an Junil zu richten - ein Engel jedoch hatte so etwas noch niemals getan.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Großer Herr, erlaubt mir Euren Schwur und die Sieben Fichten zu verteidigen. Verstoßt mich aus dem Gewölbe, nehmt mir die heilige Essenz und lasst mich sterblich wiedergeboren werden, so dass meine Taten nicht den Pakt verletzen und die Schwüre gehalten werden können!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Junil wandte sich ab. Sein Zögern entsprang nicht seinen Sorgen, sondern der Beurteilung der möglichen Folgen: würde Sphener die Sieben Fichten erfolgreich verteidigen können, war Sphener als Bestandteil der Schöpfung wertvoller als er im Himmel nutzen könnte, gab es einen anderen Weg die Schwüre zu halten und was würde verhindern, dass sich diese schlimmen Dinge nochmals wiederholen würden? Junil dachte an die angreifenden Svartalfar. Sphener wäre fähig sie zu besiegen. Die Gesetze waren klar. Sollte ein Engel seinen Fall wünschen, so durfte er.[PARAGRAPH:1]Junil reagierte mit nur einem Wort:" Genehmigt!" und Sphener war aus der Kammer verschwunden. [PARAGRAPH:1]Der Svartalfar lächelte als er seine eigene Reflexion auf seinem Schwert betrachtete. Das Schwert war zu schwer und lang für ihn, aber er würde es für viel Geld verkaufen können. Plötzlich wurde ihm das Schwert aus der hand gerissen, er wirbelte herum in Erwartung eines Scherzes seiner Gefährten nur um die Brustplatte eines 3 Meter großen Engels vor seiner Nase vorzufinden.[PARAGRAPH:1]Das Schwert war sowohl funktional wie auch zeremoniell zu nutzen, Sphener mähte die Svartalfar nieder wie ein Schnitter den Weizen. Es dauerte eine Weile bis Sphener die von den Svartalfar verursachten Verwüstungen wieder beseitigt und die Artefakte wieder an ihre angestammten Plätze zu stellen. Als dies endlich vollbracht war, kniete er zum Gebet nieder.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nachdem er das Gebet beendet hatte, war die Kammer der Sieben Fichten verschwunden. Junil hatte sie der Schöpfung entzogen um ihre Sicherheit zu gewährleisten. Alles was zurückgeblieben war, waren das Schwert und das Schild. Sphener nahm sie und betrat die Wälder. Er war schon so lange neugierig auf die Schöpfung gewesen und freute sich Junil in seiner neuen Rolle dienen zu können.</German>
		<Italian>The room was perfectly formed: identical grey tiles covered the floor and fluted columns were evenly spaced throughout the hall. Angels knelt or were seated according to their rank, which was also reflected in their dress, although the differences were often too slight for mortal eyes to recognize. In fact, the perfection of the chamber, from the exact proportions down to each fold in every angels robe, was so off-putting to mortal eyes that even the most precise couldn't help feeling like he threw the room, or the entire heaven, out of balance by his very existence.[PARAGRAPH:1]Junil stood in the center of the chamber unwavering. Words and reports were unnecessary, there was no outward sign of stress or panic, yet every angel's focus was on the same event: sacred ground was being desecrated. It was the Seven Pines, the place that the Compact was signed. It was sacred to many gods, but Junil had committed to keeping the area safe before the gods had agreed to the Compact, to ensure that the Gods and their emissaries could meet there safely, and now that oath wasn't being kept.[PARAGRAPH:1]It was the Compact itself that caused the problem, it stated that the gods and angels couldn't intervene directly with the affairs of men, instead they had to work through them by various limited and archaic means, none of which helped in this situation. Those loyal to Junil had been killed, struck down quickly through a form of stealth that obscured even the sight of the angelic watchers.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the Seven Pines, there were symbols for each of the gods that existed at the time of the Compact. The Svartalfar were stealing the symbols, all those except the symbol of their own god, Esus. Junil's symbol was a sword and shield that hung from one of the trees in the glade. A Svartalfar assassin went to claim the symbol as a personal trophy.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sphener broke the perfection of the room and stood. The angel opposite him, who was supposed to mirror his movements in every ritualized action, seemed confused. Was he supposed to follow, was this some ritual he had forgotten or was Sphener breaking the laws of the chamber? Other angels in the chamber, including Sphener's own lord, allowed a brief crease of annoyance to cross their foreheads to show their extreme disapproval of Sphener's action. Junil showed no reaction.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sphener crossed the perfect floor and kneeled before the god of law. He spoke, following the tradition of the few mortals that had come here to petition Junil, as an angel had never done so before.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Great lord, allow me to keep your promise and protect the Seven Pines. Cast me from the vault, take from me the divine essence and have me reborn mortal such that my actions will not break the Compact and both oaths will remain fulfilled."[PARAGRAPH:1]Junil turned his eyes to the prostrate lesser angel. His hesitation was not from concern, but from a consideration of the possible outcomes: would Sphener be able to defend the Pines, was Sphener more useful in creation than he was in heaven, was there another way to maintain both oaths, what would keep the same event from occurring again? Junil turned his focus on the Svartalfar attackers and decided that Sphener could defeat them; the laws were clear, if an angel wished to fall, he could.[PARAGRAPH:1]Junil responded with only one word, "Approved", and Sphener was gone from the chamber.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Svartalfar assassin smiled as he considered his own reflection in the sword's gleaming blade. The sword was too heavy and long for him but it would sell for a lifetime's wages. Then the sword was yanked out of his hands, he spun expecting to see one of his companions and found himself staring into the breastplate of an 8-foot-tall angel instead.[PARAGRAPH:1]The sword was functional as well as ornamental and Sphener cut him down. Like a scythe through grain, Sphener set on the rest, they were killed quickly, but it took longer for Sphener to replace all of the artifacts and remove any trace that they had been there from the Pines. When it was finally complete, he knelt and prayed.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Sphener ended his prayer, the Pines were gone; Junil had removed it from creation to keep it safe.

		<English>[TAB]Khord leapt over embankment and slammed his warhammer into the ground. The blow resonated through serpent's canyon and served as a beacon for the Grigori soldiers behind him and running along the canyon walls. Even the horsemen had trouble keeping up with him across the rough ground. The Dumannios moon provided reasonable light in all but the canyon's shadows, which were lost to darkness.[PARAGRAPH:1]Khord cleared another ridge and came to the canyons dead end. He had worried that their prey had escaped by magic or hiding in one of the many shadowed outcroppings along the canyon walls. But this wasn't an opponent who was accustomed to hiding.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Grigori infantry fell silent behind Khord, finally stopping their forced run. The box canyon had a rise in its center, a stone mound more primitive cultures would attribute to a natural altar of Kilmorph. Stephanos sat on his horse atop the mound.[PARAGRAPH:1]Shadows fluttered across the Grigori soldiers as Khord's brother Cabal and his hunters jumped off the canyons walls. In flight the ravens feathers woven into their cloaks made a sound like hundreds of ravens as they transformed in flight from men to birds and back again. They became a black cloud reaching down to the canyon floor where they reappeared in formation with their weapons ready and raven mask drawn down protectively in front of their faces.[PARAGRAPH:1]Stephanos's white horse glowed in the moonlight and appeared unafraid of the army of men arrayed against his rider. Stephanos himself looked like a glorious conqueror returning from battle to meet the adulation of crowds, not a refugee forced into a dead end. He looked up smiling, you could almost hear the distant triumphant cheers that followed him.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cabal rushed out screaming "Attack, don't let him speak."[PARAGRAPH:1]Unfortunately no one in the canyon heard anything beyond "don't". At a glance from Stephanos a dull throb pushed through the air, a blanket of sound that cut Cabal off from the rest of the men and sent everyone else stumbling as their ears reacted to the change in pressure. By the time they had recovered Stephanos had already started addressing the men.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Of the empires of men I value the Grigori the most. For they have recognized that the gods are not worthy of their worship. To you as men, I offer my admiration. But, of your leader, I can only say that he does not carry his goal far enough. He sulks in Erebus when he should be leading the revolution. It is not enough to refuse to obey the petulant war games the gods have planned for men, but we must overthrow those games as well."[PARAGRAPH:1]The men stood quiet. Stephanos's voice echoed through the canyon and as Khord looked around he saw that in the brief interlude between Stephanos's sentences other men nodded as if confirming statements Khord couldn't hear. Stephanos's mouth also continued to move even when Khord couldn't hear him speak, his lips drawn back in a deformed smile and his long thin tongue slipped easily about as he spoke.[PARAGRAPH:1]Khord would have remained entranced by the words except that he caught sight of his brother laying on the ground by the canyons walls. Blood ran from his ears and he was gasping as if under a great force, yet the men around stood listening to Stephanos. Khord willed himself to run to his brothers side but it was as if his body was asleep. He was able to move his mouth enough to bite down on his tongue, and that pain woke up his body and allow him to stumble forward.[PARAGRAPH:1]Above him Stephanos continued.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Cassiel tells us that the gods are corrupt. But then why does he command us to live peacefully within this jail they have built for us. If your king was corrupt would to follow the governor that still requires your gentle supplication to his orders, no matter how benign? Or would you march upon the palace and pull it down around him? We have been told this is impossible, but who has said this? The king and the governor they sent to control us!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Khord fell down beside his brother. Stephanos's words still resonated within him and each one called for his joints to stop moving, his mind to stop questioning and his soul to accept. Belief's he held for his entire life seemed little more than fairy tales compared to the immutable force of Stephanos's speech. It was becoming the foundation of everything he believed and everything else would have to be reevaluated to conform to this new ideology.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cabal was close to death, his hair was matted with blood and it pooled on the canyon floor. Cabal looked up at his brother and summoned enough strength for one last action, to reach up and box both sides of Khord's head.[PARAGRAPH:1]Khord howled in pain. His ears range from the blow. He yelled again when he saw Cabal's eyes close for the last time. He was overcome first with despair, and then with anger. Stephanos stopped speaking, or so he thought. When he looked he saw that Stephanos was still speaking, Khord just couldn't hear him beyond the ringing of his ears.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rushing forward Khord once again called upon the magic of his warhammer. Aiming not for Stephanos, but the earthen mound his horse stood upon, he struck it with enough force to shatter the rock and send the crack of the hammers impact echoing through the canyon.[PARAGRAPH:1]In that instant the men awoke from their trances. Stephanos's horse stepped back away from the crumbling rock and Khord climbed up the mound to attack Stephanos directly. Spurred on by the death of his brother he charged, yelling for his men to join with him.[PARAGRAPH:1]They did join the fight, but not as Khord wanted. Before he got to Stephanos nearly a dozen arrows had pierced him. His own men were quickly on him and dragged him down from the mound, chopping him to pieces on the canyon floor. When it was over Stephanos rode out of the canyon with his new army of Grigori soldiers behind him.</English>

Before he got to Stephanos nearly a dozen arrows had pierced him. His own men were quickly on him and dragged him down from the mound, chopping him to pieces on the canyon floor. When it was over Stephanos rode out of the canyon with his new army of Grigori soldiers behind him.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]Khord leapt over embankment and slammed his warhammer into the ground. The blow resonated through serpent's canyon and served as a beacon for the Grigori soldiers behind him and running along the canyon walls. Even the horsemen had trouble keeping up with him across the rough ground. The Dumannios moon provided reasonable light in all but the canyon's shadows, which were lost to darkness.[PARAGRAPH:1]Khord cleared another ridge and came to the canyons dead end. He had worried that their prey had escaped by magic or hiding in one of the many shadowed outcroppings along the canyon walls. But this wasn't an opponent who was accustomed to hiding.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Grigori infantry fell silent behind Khord, finally stopping their forced run. The box canyon had a rise in its center, a stone mound more primitive cultures would attribute to a natural altar of Kilmorph. Stephanos sat on his horse atop the mound.[PARAGRAPH:1]Shadows fluttered across the Grigori soldiers as Khord's brother Cabal and his hunters jumped off the canyons walls. In flight the ravens feathers woven into their cloaks made a sound like hundreds of ravens as they transformed in flight from men to birds and back again. They became a black cloud reaching down to the canyon floor where they reappeared in formation with their weapons ready and raven mask drawn down protectively in front of their faces.[PARAGRAPH:1]Stephanos's white horse glowed in the moonlight and appeared unafraid of the army of men arrayed against his rider. Stephanos himself looked like a glorious conqueror returning from battle to meet the adulation of crowds, not a refugee forced into a dead end. He looked up smiling, you could almost hear the distant triumphant cheers that followed him.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cabal rushed out screaming "Attack, don't let him speak."[PARAGRAPH:1]Unfortunately no one in the canyon heard anything beyond "don't". At a glance from Stephanos a dull throb pushed through the air, a blanket of sound that cut Cabal off from the rest of the men and sent everyone else stumbling as their ears reacted to the change in pressure. By the time they had recovered Stephanos had already started addressing the men.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Of the empires of men I value the Grigori the most. For they have recognized that the gods are not worthy of their worship. To you as men, I offer my admiration. But, of your leader, I can only say that he does not carry his goal far enough. He sulks in Erebus when he should be leading the revolution. It is not enough to refuse to obey the petulant war games the gods have planned for men, but we must overthrow those games as well."[PARAGRAPH:1]The men stood quiet. Stephanos's voice echoed through the canyon and as Khord looked around he saw that in the brief interlude between Stephanos's sentences other men nodded as if confirming statements Khord couldn't hear. Stephanos's mouth also continued to move even when Khord couldn't hear him speak, his lips drawn back in a deformed smile and his long thin tongue slipped easily about as he spoke.[PARAGRAPH:1]Khord would have remained entranced by the words except that he caught sight of his brother laying on the ground by the canyons walls. Blood ran from his ears and he was gasping as if under a great force, yet the men around stood listening to Stephanos. Khord willed himself to run to his brothers side but it was as if his body was asleep. He was able to move his mouth enough to bite down on his tongue, and that pain woke up his body and allow him to stumble forward.[PARAGRAPH:1]Above him Stephanos continued.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Cassiel tells us that the gods are corrupt. But then why does he command us to live peacefully within this jail they have built for us. If your king was corrupt would to follow the governor that still requires your gentle supplication to his orders, no matter how benign? Or would you march upon the palace and pull it down around him? We have been told this is impossible, but who has said this? The king and the governor they sent to control us!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Khord fell down beside his brother. Stephanos's words still resonated within him and each one called for his joints to stop moving, his mind to stop questioning and his soul to accept. Belief's he held for his entire life seemed little more than fairy tales compared to the immutable force of Stephanos's speech. It was becoming the foundation of everything he believed and everything else would have to be reevaluated to conform to this new ideology.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cabal was close to death, his hair was matted with blood and it pooled on the canyon floor. Cabal looked up at his brother and summoned enough strength for one last action, to reach up and box both sides of Khord's head.[PARAGRAPH:1]Khord howled in pain. His ears range from the blow. He yelled again when he saw Cabal's eyes close for the last time. He was overcome first with despair, and then with anger. Stephanos stopped speaking, or so he thought. When he looked he saw that Stephanos was still speaking, Khord just couldn't hear him beyond the ringing of his ears.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rushing forward Khord once again called upon the magic of his warhammer. Aiming not for Stephanos, but the earthen mound his horse stood upon, he struck it with enough force to shatter the rock and send the crack of the hammers impact echoing through the canyon.[PARAGRAPH:1]In that instant the men awoke from their trances. Stephanos's horse stepped back away from the crumbling rock and Khord climbed up the mound to attack Stephanos directly.

There weren't any deer hanging here now, but this was a spot accustomed to death.[PARAGRAPH:1]I was never asked to dig, and didn't offer to help, except to place the body in the shallow hole when it was complete. After the hole was covered, the men stood quiet for a second, then wandered back to the wagons to sleep, exhausted from the day. No one said anything about the boy.[PARAGRAPH:1]I sat at the edge of the glade, silent myself. Valin said another of his prayers then turned to walk back.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Why didn't your prayers heal him?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Valin wiped the sweat from his forehead as he considered the question. He seemed to be effected by the boy's death, at least more than the guards, but he hadn't said anything about it either. He and I were the last ones in the glade, if you didn't count the newly buried corpse.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I dont know why some get healed and some don't. I don't pretend to understand. I just know that people die, both good and evil, every day. I know there is a war being fought, and casualties on both sides. I wouldn't assume that either side is so much stronger that it overwhelms the other side in every battle and suffers no losses."[PARAGRAPH:1]"So there is only so much healing to go around? Your god healed the bruise I left on your face, but wouldn't save this boys life. Did you pray for this boy to be healed?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I did."[PARAGRAPH:1]Valin looked around the glade, noticing the cut ropes and the blood marks in the grass for the first time. He began smoothing out the dirt on the grave, hoping that whoever hung deer here wouldn't notice or mess with it.[PARAGRAPH:1]"It's a war, thats all I know." Valin said.[PARAGRAPH:1]"My experience with war tells me that they typically suit the desires of the generals and emperors that wage them, but not the people that fight and die in them."[PARAGRAPH:1]Valin seemed ready to quip back something at me, but he bit his tongue and looked only at the cut ropes before responding.[PARAGRAPH:1]"When I was a boy, maybe 6 or 7 years old, I couldn't hunt with my father. I was soft-hearted, unable to kill a rabbit. I would cry if I even saw one dead. My father was a very strict man, and he wanted to raise me well. I was punished for my weakness, lashed, hit. But I still couldn't get used to the sight of blood."[PARAGRAPH:1]Valin paused, caught up in the memories in his head, before continuing.[PARAGRAPH:1]"He had taken away my food, stating that if I was unwilling to hunt I wouldn't share in the rewards of that hunt. I began sneaking food, radishes and onions from the garden. When he caught me I was punished..." Valin spit out the word, "and then he locked me in the smokehouse for two days."[PARAGRAPH:1]"There were fresh deer bleeding out in the smokehouse, and it was a tiny wooden shack, barely larger than an outhouse. I was starving, tired, and spent those two days terrified by the blood dripping on me, and the deer faces staring down from the darkness above me."[PARAGRAPH:1]"It sounds horrible." I couldn't figure out any other way to respond.[PARAGRAPH:1]"It was..." he searched for the word, "Traumatic. But afterwards I wasn't afraid of blood anymore."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Or you were just more scared of your father." He ignored my statement. "So are you saying Junil is like your father?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, I'm saying we are like children. We can hope for a perfect world, we can plead with our superiors to provide it, be they our parents, our emperors, or our gods. But our world isn't perfect, all we can do is try to strengthen the good we find and weaken the evil, and sometimes that means we will have to deal with blood. To fix a meal, or protect a caravan from lawless men."[PARAGRAPH:1]I was unconvinced but I didn't want to push Valin any further, so I only nodded and picked myself up. I helped him finish covering up the grave and then we walked back to the caravan and I fell into more of my nightmares of battle and killing, but this time Valin was there with me.[PARAGRAPH:1]-The Tale of Saverous, Act I: Chapter 9</English>
		<French>The guardsman, Nathan, has died. It seems we will have another burial.[PARAGRAPH:1]Valin checked Nathan and gave one more prayer before we carried him off of the road and to a small glade with soft ground.

		<German>Der Gardist, Nathan, war gestorben. Es würde also noch ein weiteres Begräbnis geben.[PARAGRAPH:1]Valin untersuchte Nathan und betete noch einmal für ihn, bevor wir ihn weg von der Straße und weiter zu einer kleinen Lichtung mit weichem Boden trugen. Valin und ein paar Wachen begannen zu graben, während ich den in ein Leintuch eingewickelten Körper auf den Boden betete und darauf wartete, dass sie ihre Arbeit beendeten oder mir eine der Schaufeln in die Hand drückten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Banditen, oder jemand anders, hatten die Lichtung dazu genutzt ihre Jagdbeute aufzuhängen. Abgeschnittene Seile hingen von einigen Ästen des Baumes und das Gras direkt darunter war an einigen Stellen stumpfbraun gefärbt. Gerade hing kein Wild an dem Baum, aber dieser Ort hatte den Tod schon oft gesehen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ich wurde nicht gebeten zu graben, und ich bot meine Hilfe auch nicht an, außer am Schluss, um den Körper in das flache Loch zu legen. Nachdem das Grab wieder zugeschaufelt war, standen die Männer noch einige Sekunden stumm an dessen Rand, dann gingen sie langsam zurück zu den Wägen, um zu schlafen, erschöpft von den Anstrengungen dieses Tages. Keiner hatte auch nur ein Wort über den Jungen verloren.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ich setzte mich an den Rand der Lichtung, still wie die anderen. Valin sprach ein weiteres Gebet, dann drehte auch er sich um und schickte sich an, die Lichtung ebenfalls zu verlassen.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Warum haben deine Gebete ihn nicht geheilt?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Valin wischte sich den Schweiß von der Stirn, während er über die Frage nachdachte. Er schien mitgenommen vom Tod des Jungen, jedenfalls mehr als die Wachen, aber auch er hatte bisher kein Wort über ihn gesprochen. Er und ich waren die Letzten auf der Lichtung, den Leichnam in dem frischen Grab nicht mitgerechnet.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich weis nicht, warum einige geheilt werden und andere nicht. Ich versuche gar nicht erst, dass zu verstehen. Ich weis nur, dass Menschen sterben, gute wie böse, jeden Tag. Ich weiß, dass wir uns im Krieg befinden, und Opfer gibt es auf beiden Seiten. Ich glaube kaum, das eine der beiden Seiten jemals so viel stärker ist, dass sie die andere Seite im Kampf besiegt und keine Verluste erleidet."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Also gibt es nur soviel Heilung, wie grade eben nötig? Dein Gott hat die Prellung geheilt, die ich auf deinem Gesicht hinterlassen habe, aber er hat diesen Jungen einfach so sein Leben aushauchen lassen. Hast du überhaupt für die Heilung des Jungen gebetet?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Das habe ich."[PARAGRAPH:1]Valin ließ seinen Blick über die Lichtung schweifen. Sein Blick blieb an den abgeschnittenen Seilen und den Blutflecken hängen. Er starrte sie an, als sähe er sie zum ersten Mal. Er begann, die Erde auf dem frischen Grab zu verwischen, als hoffe er, das, wer immer seine Beute hier aufhängte, das Grab nicht bemerken würde.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Es ist Krieg, das ist alles, was ich weiß" sagte Valin.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Meine Erfahrung mit dem Krieg hat mich gelehrt, dass sie sich normalerweise nur um die Wünsche der Generäle und Herrscher kümmern, die sie finanzieren, aber nicht um die der Menschen, die in dem Krieg kämpfen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Valin schien etwas antworten zu wollen, doch dann biß er sich auf die Zunge und wandte seinen Blick wieder auf die Seile, bevor er antwortete.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Als ich noch ein Junge war, so etwa sechs oder sieben Jahre alt, konnte ich nicht mit meinem Vater jagen gehen. Ich war so zart besaitet, ich hätte nie einen Hasen töten können. Ich hätte jedes Mal heulen können, wenn ich ein totes Tier nur sehen musste. Mein Vater war ein sehr strenger Mann, und er wollte mich gut erziehen. Ich wurde für meine Schwäche bestraft, ausgepeitscht, verprügelt. Aber an den Anblick von Blut konnte ich mich trotzdem nicht gewöhnen."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Valin machte eine Pause und hing eine Weile seinen Erinnerungen nach, bevor er weiter sprach.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Er gab mir nichts mehr zu essen. Er meinte, wenn ich nicht jagen wolle, sollte ich auch nicht an der Beute teilhaben. Ich begann, essen zu stehlen, Radieschen und Zwiebeln aus dem Garten. Als mein Vater mich erwischte wurde ich bestraft..." Valin spuckte das letzte Wort aus "und dann sperrte er mich für zwei Tage in die Räucherkammer."[PARAGRAPH:1]In der Kammer hing frisch erlegtes Wild, das zum ausbluten aufgehängt worden war. Und es war nur eine sehr kleine Hütte, nicht größer als ein Klohaus. Ich war am verhungern, ich war müde, und ich verbrachte zwei Tage im Zustand permanenten Entsetzens, wegen all dem Blut, das in der Dunkelheit auf mich herabtropfte."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Das klingt schrecklich." Mir viel keine bessere Erwiderung ein.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Es war..." er suchte nach einem passenden Wort, "traumatisierend. Aber danach hatte ich meine Angst vor Blut verloren."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Oder du hattest einfach mehr Angst vor deinem Vater." Er überging meinen Kommentar. "Meinst du also, Junil ist wie dein Vater?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Nein, ich meine, wir sind wie Kinder. Wir können von einer perfekten Welt träumen, wir können unsere unsere Eltern, unsere Herrscher oder unsere Götter darum anflehen. Aber unsere Welt ist nicht perfekt, und alles was wir tun können ist, zu versuchen das Gute in der Welt zu stärken und das Böse zu schwächen. Und manchmal bedeutet das eben, dass wir uns mit Blut befassen müssen. Um Nahrung zu erhalten oder eine Karawane vor gesetzlosen Männern zu schützen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Ich war noch nicht überzeugt, aber ich wollte Valin nicht noch weiter reizen, also nickte ich einfach und erhob mich. Ich half ihm noch, das Grab vollends zu bedecken, dann gingen wir zurück zu den Wagen und ich viel in einen tiefen Schlaf, zurück zu meinen Albträumen von der Schlacht und dem Gemetzel, aber diesmal war Valin mit mir dort.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Geschichte des Saverous, Akt I: Kapitel 9</German>

		<English>In times such as these, no man is raised without knowledge of how to use weapons, and no household is without a sword. When all others fail, the people themselves are the last line of defense. Warriors are no more than peasants with any weapon they can get their hands on, called upon to defend their homes, their livelihoods, and their families. Although they fight with a desperate bravery and stubbornness born of the knowledge that they are fighting to protect everything they hold dear, their lack of training and haphazard equipment makes them no match for professional soldiers. The Barbarian Warrior has none of the merits of the civilized men, save their fanatical bravery. Warriors form the bulk of the Barbarian war bands that prey on outlying settlements, thriving on destruction and slaughter. Most Barbarians carry on the way of their nomadic ancestors, ceaselessly on the move, still worshipping the ancient and bloodthirsty pagan gods, and their spine-chilling war cries and horrific appearance are the terror of the borderlands. These menaces to the civilized world deserve nothing less than to be exterminated.</English>

		<German>In Zeiten wie diesen, wächst kein Mann auf ohne zu wissen wie man eine Waffe benutzt, und kein Haus ist ohne ein Schwert. Wenn alles andere versagt, sind die einfachen Bürger selbst sind die letzte Verteidigungslinie. Kämpfer sind nichts weiter als Bauern mit irgendeiner Waffe die sie in ihre Hände bekommen, aufgefordert ihre Hauser, Familien und ihre Existenz zu beschützen. Obwohl sie kämpfen mit verzweifelter Tapferkeit und  Dickköpfigkeit,  geboren aus dem wissen heraus das sie kämpfen um all das zu schützen was ihnen lieb und teuer ist, macht ihr Mangel an Erfahrung und ihre zufällige Ausrüstung sie zu keinem Gegner für professionelle Soldaten. Der barbarische Krieger hat keinen von den werten wie die zivilisierten Männer, außer ihrer fanatischen Tapferkeit. Krieger bilden den Hauptteil der barbarischen Kriegsgruppen, die abgelegene Siedlungen als Beute sehen, sie gedeihen beim Abschlachten und Zerstören. Die meisten Barbaren folgen dem Weg ihrer Vorfahren, unablässig in Bewegung, immer noch die alten und blutrünstigen heidnischen Götter verehrend, und ihre markerschütternden Kriegsschreie und ihre furchtbare Erscheinung sind die Geißel der Grenzländer. Diese Bedrohung der zivilisierten Welt verdient nicht weniger als ausgerottet zu werden.</German>

		<English>Welcome to Fall from Heaven II.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since this is your first time playing it may be worth taking a few minutes to describe some of the basics. First the tech tree, there are a lot of tech options. I would recommend teching toward Archery for your first game. Barbarians are more common and powerful in Fall from Heaven and players often underestimate the amount of early defense that is required to protect your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After getting to Archery you will need to build some Archery Ranges in your cities before you can build Archers. This is a common mechanic in Fall from Heaven (units require buildings) that forces specialization in your cities and an a deeper investment in the troops you wish to create. Once you have the Archery Ranges you will be able to build Archers. It may be more effective to build an Archery Range in one city and use that city to produce Archers to protect all your cities.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After Archery there are a wide variety of tech options to consider. For your first game I would suggest you stay away from the magical techs early on, like Knowledge of the Ether and anything behind it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Here are a few special mechanics you may have early questions on:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Weapon System- Copper, Iron and Mithril give strength bonuses to melee units (and a few others). This is a considerable advantage and even warriors get +1 strength if you manage to get access to Copper.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lairs- It is a dangerous world, and it has a mix of monsters lairs spread across it. These lairs will produce new barbarian units until they are destroyed. You can destroy them by moving a unit onto them and selecting the action button to explore the lair with that unit. Be careful, although exploring a lair could result in finding treasure or other rewards it can also release new enemies or powerful boss monsters.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Heroes- There are barbarian heroes, civilization heroes and religious heroes. Which ones you have access to depends on what techs you have, what civilizations you are playing as and which religion you have. They are all very powerful but once they are dead they are dead forever, so be careful in their lose and when you see them nearing in your enemies hands. One of the barbarians heroes, Orthus, is a powerful orc warlord that may spawn near you. If so make sure to have your defenders ready as he has killed many civilizations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Have fun and try things, most get crushed in their first few games. The strategy's that have worked ever since Civ1 won't work here. But hopefully you will enjoy exploring the world of Erebus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Keep in mind that there is a lot to try in Fall from Heaven. There are scenarios you can play from the main menu -> single player -> play a scenario -> "Fall from Heaven II scenarios". There is a mini-game called Somnium you can challenge other human and AI players too (the icon in the upper left that looks like a pawn opens the Somnium menu). The civilopedia has a lot of good information in it, be sure to check out the concepts section or more details on a lot of the Fall from Heaven special mechanics.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After you are done playing please come to the forums link on www.civfanatics.com/ffh to provide feedback, ask questions and find player to play multi-player with.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Thank you for playing,[NEWLINE]the Fall from Heaven Team</English>
