		<German>[TAB]Vor dem Zeitalter der Wiedergeburt gab es die Sheaïm als Volk noch nicht. Als das Zeitalter des Eises endete, waren sie ein Volk verschiedenster Zivilisationen, nur vereint durch ein gemeinsames Ziel: die Schöpfung durch die gewaltige Magie der Armageddonzauber zu vernichten. Die meisten Sheaïm verfolgen dieses Ziel, um ihre eigenen Kenntnisse der Magie zu erweitern, andere glauben, dass sie für die Zerstörung der Schöpfung auf ewig belohnt würden, während einige wenige der Welt einfach nur ein Ende setzen wollen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tebryn war einst ein mächtiger Zauberer, der nach seinem Tod in die Hölle verbannt wurde. Cerdiwen befreite ihn, um die Zerstörung der Schöpfung voranzutreiben. Os-Gabella hingegen war der erste Mensch, der von den Göttern erschaffen wurde, und einst als Braut für Nemed bestimmt gewesen. Sie war eine Unsterbliche, aber sie rebellierte gegen Nemed und die Pläne der Götter mit ihr. Nun ist sie bis zum Ende der Zeit in der Schöpfung gefangen. Sie und Tebryn streben danach, ihren Gefängnissen zu entkommen, indem sie die Welt zerstören.</German>

		<English>[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Strategy: Masters of summoning, the Sheaim's Eater of Dreams are a powerful unit made even more powerful by allowing their summoned units to last for three turns instead of the normal one. They also have access to the Pyre Zombie units, which explode when killed and do damage to the one killing them. Their most important difference from other civs concerns their method for acquiring units. Later melee units are not buildable, but by building a planar gate building, cities will acquire units freely over time, more so as the Armageddon Counter rises. This allows the Sheaim to focus research on the magic line without neglecting other units types.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Screams echoed through Galveholm. There was no way to predict their frequency, often days or weeks would pass between hearing them. But when they did occur it was impossible to deny the tortured anguish in them. Even the most hardened would whisper a quiet prayer for the victim, and many in the city were reduced to tears.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gaulos had a way with women, he prided himself on it. There were few things he couldn't get through guile or smile. Perhaps they wouldn't agree to his most intimate desires, but they would join him alone in a dark cellar, and that was all the cooperation he required.[PARAGRAPH:1]He found young girls the most vulnerable. In naively agreeing to his meetings, being unable to resist his forced advances once alone, and the most satisfying to his desires. Even so young they were still women and susceptible to his charms.[PARAGRAPH:1]But he was too eager, a village ripe with beautiful young girls nearly stopped his heart when his caravan rolled into it. They chased each other outside a small temple and cared for delicate dolls. After three went missing the village was on the verge of hysteria, the caravan was torn apart and he was accused of the murders. They had no evidence, but that isn't required in such situations so Gaulos headed somewhere they wouldn't follow, into the Sheaim lands.[PARAGRAPH:1]Now he stood in a pack of lowest dregs of humanity outside of the Sheaim gates. Immigrants had to display some skill before they were allowed into the city, and since the gatekeeper was male, Gaulos didn't have anything to show. They had already begun to pull some aside to tend to the pyre's, and no one returned from that.[PARAGRAPH:1]On his third day at the gate a stir rose from inside the city. The guards, to that point cruel and inattentive, went suddenly alert and the gatekeeper ordered everyone away from the gate. Bestial men that had been pissing and shitting off the wall and onto the huddled immigrants below became paragons of duty.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gaulos and the mass of lesser men waited quietly. Nothing scared the Sheaim, and many began to pull back further from the gate. Then they saw the source of the fear coming, a black carriage pulled by horses with burning hooves and wild, bestial eyes. As they got closer they could see that the horses had sharp wolf like teeth, those accustomed to tearing flesh, and they looked at the assembled men like beasts viewing their next meal.[PARAGRAPH:1]A mobius witch drove the carriage. Her form twisted and bent back in on itself as if she was a leather skin stretched tight over a rough stone, as if she wasn't able to fully enter this world. But inside the carriage was a more amazing site. Os-Gabella, Queen of Storms, sat and showed little interest in the outside. Despite the carriages solid construction the windows were open and their were no signs of any precautions taken to protect its passenger.[PARAGRAPH:1]The carriage stopped at the gate where Os-Gabella passed a few quiet questions to the gatekeeper before preparing to head into the city. Knowing that it may be his last chance to use his only gift Gaulos stepped up onto the road behind the carriage.[PARAGRAPH:1]"My Queen, please allow me entrance to your magnificent city."[PARAGRAPH:1]She eyed him dispassionately. The gatekeeper looked horrified and shocked by Gaulos's behavior. If Os-Gabella's neck would have stretched out and allowed her to bite off Gaulos's head no one at the gate would have been surprised. But since he was now committed Gaulos continued on.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The legend of your beauty brought me to these lands, across barren wastes and dangerous roads. But now I see that those who spoke of you were lying, for you are twice as beautiful as they described."[PARAGRAPH:1]Again there was nothing but stunned silence. Then finally Os-Gabella replied, "Get in."[PARAGRAPH:1]Stunned, no one knew what to do. Os-Gabella kicked open the carriage door and that jolted the gatekeeper into action. He held the door while Gaulos climbed in.[PARAGRAPH:1]The carriage rolled through Galveholm while nobles and peasants scrambled out of the way. They looked at Os-Gabella and Gaulos with fear and wonder. This was a life Gaulos could get used to.[PARAGRAPH:1]He took his eyes off the street and saw she was regarding him. He met her gaze, dipping his head enough to let his boyish bangs obscure the eyes women always complimented him for. He looked back up and smiled, but her expression didn't change.[PARAGRAPH:1]Feeling a bit uncomfortable Gaulos asked, "Where are we going?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"To meet your father."[PARAGRAPH:1]The tattered edges of the mobius witches robes reached through the window of the carriage and brushed up against Gaulos's neck. The touch made him shiver even in the oppressive heat of the day. Gaulos's father was a dockworker in the Lanun city of Bolans, he hadn't talked to him in years, and he couldn't imagine a less likely destination for the carriage.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Sheaim palace was ahead and the gates were raised as the carriage approached. They stopped in a courtyard where a band of Revelers argued. Os-Gabella stepped out of the carriage without pretense. Gaulos followed, more from fear of being left alone with the odd monsters then from desire to stay with her. As they entered the palace he could hear slaves being dragged over and fed to the dark horses.[PARAGRAPH:1]Inside a minotaur opened a great vault door. Behind the door stairs led deep beneath the palace. Gaulos briefly considered not going but a glance from the minotaur sent him scrambling down the stairs behind Os-Gabella.[PARAGRAPH:1]The palace construction gave way to natural caverns. The stairs were replaced by a rough stone floor that had worn spots where Os-Gabella stepped without thinking. Jewels in her armor radiated a pale light and provided the only illumination in the passage. Gaulos struggled to stay within the radius of her light.[PARAGRAPH:1]The passage ended at a small chamber with a stone arch in the center. Os-Gabella stepped up to the arch and traced runes in the air before it. Then she stepped into the arch and the chamber went dark.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gaulos scrambled forward. He had a vague memory of those girls he seduced into joining him in dark cellars, at that point where his eyesight was better in the dark than theirs and he could sit back and watch them fumble in the darkness. He imagined that all the girls he hurt and killed were watching him, enjoying those last few moments before they killed him. The memory made him panic and he slammed against the stone arch and fell through the archway.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sudden brightness blinded him. Torches hung on the walls and in the center of the room a man hung over a pit bound by bright silver chains. The man was gaunt and looked strained beyond exhaustion, but he was uninjured. Os-Gabella walked over to the man, withdrew a crystal from her armor and held it over the pit.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gaulos picked himself up and walked over behind her. The chained man looked up in surprise and yelled.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Run child, run!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Gaulos froze, the man's words had power but when Gaulos looked back at the arch there was only darkness and the imagined ghosts of his victims beyond it. There was no other place to run. Instead Gaulos spoke to Os-Gabella.[PARAGRAPH:1]"That's not my father."[PARAGRAPH:1]Os-Gabella smirked, "Of course it is, the first father. Nemed, my husband." she said the last part with clear disdain. "We are here to find a way to kill him."[PARAGRAPH:1]With that black flames burst up out of the pit.[PARAGRAPH:1]"These fires are said to be able to burn the ethereal, they are from the deepest hell. I wonder what effect it will have on immortal flesh."[PARAGRAPH:1]Os-Gabella raised her hand and Nemed was dropped into the pit. His screams echoed through the chamber and up into Galveholm above. Gaulos turned to run, his fear of ghosts replaced by the torment in front of him. But Os-Gabella was faster. She grabbed him by the collar and dragged him to the pit.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I need to know the effect on mortal flesh as well."[PARAGRAPH:1]Gaulos reached within the folds of his shirt, for the knife he always kept there. With one smooth movement he thrust it up into Os-Gabella's throat.[PARAGRAPH:1]Os-Gabella laughed, "If you could kill me we wouldn't need these damn tests!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Gaulos withdrew the knife to stab again only to notice that the wound healed as soon as the knife was removed. Then Os-Gabella shoved him down into the pit with the screaming Nemed. The flames quickly rushed up his legs and onto his chest and head. His screams joined Nemed's.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gaulos awoke in a grey wasteland. His skin was burnt and blistered, his boyish hair was burnt off. Every movement was torture. He knew he was dead. It was an uncomfortable afterlife but bearable. Until Gaulos saw the spirits of the girls he killed coming for him.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Als die Götter die Menschheit erschufen, brachten sie zum Beginn der Art zwei unsterbliche Wesen hervor, einen Mann und eine Frau. Die Frau nannten sie Gabella, sie sollte die Gehilfin des Mannes sein. Aber Gabella war ungehorsam und weigerte sich, unterdrückt zu werden. Als die Konklave herausfand, dass sie von einem dunklen Gedanken beherrscht wurde, ordneten sie ihre Bestrafung an, woraufhin sie zum Bair von Lacuna floh und von der Göttin Ceridwen versteckt wurde. Die Götter indes formten eine neue Gehilfin für den ersten Mann, auf dass ihre Sterblichkeit an alle nachfolgenden Generationen weitergegeben werden soll.[PARAGRAPH:1]In der Bair nahm Gabella den Namen Os-Gabella "Gabella die Ungebundene" an, aber sie sah sich nicht in der Lage, völlig allein als Unsterbliche zu leben. Sie mag dem Willen der Götter getrotzt haben, anderen zu dienen, doch sie benötigte trotzdem noch Gesellschaft. Die Götter wussten das und erwarteten eines Tages ihre Rückkehr. Immer noch den Göttern trotzend, kam sie während der 6. Generation der Menschheit aus dem Bair und stahl zwei Kinder, die sie mit zu sich zurück nahm. Eines nannte sie Alexis, das andere Flauros, und sie zog beide als ihre eigenen Kinder auf.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lange nachdem sie von ihren Kindern verlassen wurde, wurde Os-Gabella der Erschaffung des Lebens überdrüssig. Von nun an versuchte sie, es zu zerstören, und um das zu bewerkstelligen, begann sie das Armageddon. Sie kümmerte es nicht, ob der Himmel oder die Hölle den Konflikt gewannen, sie wollte die Götter dazu zwingen, all dies zu beenden, und damit auch ihr eigenes, unsterbliches Leben.</German>

They stopped in a courtyard where a band of Revelers argued. Os-Gabella stepped out of the carriage without pretense. Gaulos followed, more from fear of being left alone with the odd monsters then from desire to stay with her. As they entered the palace he could hear slaves being dragged over and fed to the dark horses.[PARAGRAPH:1]Inside a minotaur opened a great vault door. Behind the door stairs led deep beneath the palace. Gaulos briefly considered not going but a glance from the minotaur sent him scrambling down the stairs behind Os-Gabella.[PARAGRAPH:1]The palace construction gave way to natural caverns. The stairs were replaced by a rough stone floor that had worn spots where Os-Gabella stepped without thinking. Jewels in her armor radiated a pale light and provided the only illumination in the passage. Gaulos struggled to stay within the radius of her light.[PARAGRAPH:1]The passage ended at a small chamber with a stone arch in the center. Os-Gabella stepped up to the arch and traced runes in the air before it. Then she stepped into the arch and the chamber went dark.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gaulos scrambled forward. He had a vague memory of those girls he seduced into joining him in dark cellars, at that point where his eyesight was better in the dark than theirs and he could sit back and watch them fumble in the darkness. He imagined that all the girls he hurt and killed were watching him, enjoying those last few moments before they killed him. The memory made him panic and he slammed against the stone arch and fell through the archway.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sudden brightness blinded him. Torches hung on the walls and in the center of the room a man hung over a pit bound by bright silver chains. The man was gaunt and looked strained beyond exhaustion, but he was uninjured. Os-Gabella walked over to the man, withdrew a crystal from her armor and held it over the pit.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gaulos picked himself up and walked over behind her. The chained man looked up in surprise and yelled.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Run child, run!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Gaulos froze, the man's words had power but when Gaulos looked back at the arch there was only darkness and the imagined ghosts of his victims beyond it. There was no other place to run. Instead Gaulos spoke to Os-Gabella.[PARAGRAPH:1]"That's not my father."[PARAGRAPH:1]Os-Gabella smirked, "Of course it is, the first father. Nemed, my husband." she said the last part with clear disdain. "We are here to find a way to kill him."[PARAGRAPH:1]With that black flames burst up out of the pit.[PARAGRAPH:1]"These fires are said to be able to burn the ethereal, they are from the deepest hell. I wonder what effect it will have on immortal flesh."[PARAGRAPH:1]Os-Gabella raised her hand and Nemed was dropped into the pit. His screams echoed through the chamber and up into Galveholm above. Gaulos turned to run, his fear of ghosts replaced by the torment in front of him. But Os-Gabella was faster. She grabbed him by the collar and dragged him to the pit.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I need to know the effect on mortal flesh as well."[PARAGRAPH:1]Gaulos reached within the folds of his shirt, for the knife he always kept there. With one smooth movement he thrust it up into Os-Gabella's throat.[PARAGRAPH:1]Os-Gabella laughed, "If you could kill me we wouldn't need these damn tests!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Gaulos withdrew the knife to stab again only to notice that the wound healed as soon as the knife was removed. Then Os-Gabella shoved him down into the pit with the screaming Nemed. The flames quickly rushed up his legs and onto his chest and head. His screams joined Nemed's.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gaulos awoke in a grey wasteland. His skin was burnt and blistered, his boyish hair was burnt off. Every movement was torture. He knew he was dead. It was an uncomfortable afterlife but bearable. Until Gaulos saw the spirits of the girls he killed coming for him.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[TAB]Screams echoed through Galveholm. There was no way to predict their frequency, often days or weeks would pass between hearing them. But when they did occur it was impossible to deny the tortured anguish in them. Even the most hardened would whisper a quiet prayer for the victim, and many in the city were reduced to tears.[PARAGRAPH:2]Gaulos had a way with women, he prided himself on it. There were few things he couldn't get through guile or smile. Perhaps they wouldn't agree to his most intimate desires, but they would join him alone in a dark cellar, and that was all the cooperation he required.[PARAGRAPH:1]He found young girls the most vulnerable. In naively agreeing to his meetings, being unable to resist his forced advances once alone, and the most satisfying to his desires. Even so young they were still women and susceptible to his charms.[PARAGRAPH:1]But he was too eager, a village ripe with beautiful young girls nearly stopped his heart when his caravan rolled into it. They chased each other outside a small temple and cared for delicate dolls. After three went missing the village was on the verge of hysteria, the caravan was torn apart and he was accused of the murders. They had no evidence, but that isn't required in such situations so Gaulos headed somewhere they wouldn't follow, into the Sheaim lands.[PARAGRAPH:1]Now he stood in a pack of lowest dregs of humanity outside of the Sheaim gates. Immigrants had to display some skill before they were allowed into the city, and since the gatekeeper was male, Gaulos didn't have anything to show. They had already begun to pull some aside to tend to the pyre's, and no one returned from that.[PARAGRAPH:1]On his third day at the gate a stir rose from inside the city. The guards, to that point cruel and inattentive, went suddenly alert and the gatekeeper ordered everyone away from the gate. Bestial men that had been pissing and shitting off the wall and onto the huddled immigrants below became paragons of duty.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gaulos and the mass of lesser men waited quietly. Nothing scared the Sheaim, and many began to pull back further from the gate. Then they saw the source of the fear coming, a black carriage pulled by horses with burning hooves and wild, bestial eyes. As they got closer they could see that the horses had sharp wolf like teeth, those accustomed to tearing flesh, and they looked at the assembled men like beasts viewing their next meal.[PARAGRAPH:1]A mobius witch drove the carriage. Her form twisted and bent back in on itself as if she was a leather skin stretched tight over a rough stone, as if she wasn't able to fully enter this world. But inside the carriage was a more amazing site. Os-Gabella, Queen of Storms, sat and showed little interest in the outside. Despite the carriages solid construction the windows were open and their were no signs of any precautions taken to protect its passenger.[PARAGRAPH:1]The carriage stopped at the gate where Os-Gabella passed a few quiet questions to the gatekeeper before preparing to head into the city. Knowing that it may be his last chance to use his only gift Gaulos stepped up onto the road behind the carriage.[PARAGRAPH:1]"My Queen, please allow me entrance to your magnificent city."[PARAGRAPH:1]She eyed him dispassionately. The gatekeeper looked horrified and shocked by Gaulos's behavior. If Os-Gabella's neck would have stretched out and allowed her to bite off Gaulos's head no one at the gate would have been surprised. But since he was now committed Gaulos continued on.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The legend of your beauty brought me to these lands, across barren wastes and dangerous roads. But now I see that those who spoke of you were lying, for you are twice as beautiful as they described."[PARAGRAPH:1]Again there was nothing but stunned silence. Then finally Os-Gabella replied, "Get in."[PARAGRAPH:1]Stunned, no one knew what to do. Os-Gabella kicked open the carriage door and that jolted the gatekeeper into action. He held the door while Gaulos climbed in.[PARAGRAPH:1]The carriage rolled through Galveholm while nobles and peasants scrambled out of the way. They looked at Os-Gabella and Gaulos with fear and wonder. This was a life Gaulos could get used to.[PARAGRAPH:1]He took his eyes off the street and saw she was regarding him. He met her gaze, dipping his head enough to let his boyish bangs obscure the eyes women always complimented him for. He looked back up and smiled, but her expression didn't change.[PARAGRAPH:1]Feeling a bit uncomfortable Gaulos asked, "Where are we going?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"To meet your father."[PARAGRAPH:1]The tattered edges of the mobius witches robes reached through the window of the carriage and brushed up against Gaulos's neck. The touch made him shiver even in the oppressive heat of the day. Gaulos's father was a dockworker in the Lanun city of Bolans, he hadn't talked to him in years, and he couldn't imagine a less likely destination for the carriage.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Sheaim palace was ahead and the gates were raised as the carriage approached. They stopped in a courtyard where a band of Revelers argued. Os-Gabella stepped out of the carriage without pretense. Gaulos followed, more from fear of being left alone with the odd monsters then from desire to stay with her.

		<English>[TAB]The Age of Ice was a paradise compared to what I endured. As men huddled in frozen caves, and the Bannor raced across the plains of ash in Agares hell I was held underneath the fractured surface of Camulos's hell.[PARAGRAPH:1]Camulos is the god of war, and his hell is the proving ground for new demons. Here they learn the arts of chaotic battle in the unending wars that rage across its surface. The souls, once moral, become desensitized to feeling and inflicting pain. Then they begin to delight in it, cruelly destroying anyone weaker than them across the volcanic terrain.[PARAGRAPH:1]Beneath the wars, in pits regularly opened or consumed by the violent earthquakes that shake the world, are the vast prisons where the victims of war are kept. I had suffered through the mire of Mulcarn, passed the trials of Mammon's great city but I was a quick victim to violence of this realm.[PARAGRAPH:1]Torturers usually want something from their victims, secrets, cooperation or conversion. But here they subjected us to anguish only to enjoy our suffering. And in a world without the escape of death, there was no hope of an end to the torment. You bleed and scream for centuries.[PARAGRAPH:1]The eruptions occasionally open new tunnels in the prisons, collapsing walls allow the imprisoned to flee to the world's surface and escape their torment for a time.[PARAGRAPH:1]After one of these I fled into wastes, where the sand cut through exposed flesh like small shards of glass. I huddled beneath the hide of a pit beast and gripped one of the back spikes from the beast as a crude weapon. My magic failed me in hell. I traced a rune in the sand, a fire sign with broken bindings and willed it alive. A faint flame flickered within it. When I was alive I could have summoned torrents of fire out of the rune, I could have assaulted a city with it. Now it only flickered weakly.[PARAGRAPH:1]Howls interrupted my concentration. Demons avoided battles in the wastes, but hunters lead by hellhounds would come through looking for those, like myself, that sought refuge here. I brushed away the rune and started deeper into the wastes.[PARAGRAPH:1]By they were faster than I was and the hound could smell me. They didn't follow scent like moral dogs, they could smell fear and there was no escaping them. As I scrambled across another ridge a darkened figure rushed at me, spear in hand. He was emaciated, weak, and I easily knocked the spear aside.[PARAGRAPH:1]I pulled the man to the ground, he was trembling, and whispered into his ear.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You will be okay" I lied, "I won't hurt you, but we have to kill the hound that is coming for us."[PARAGRAPH:1]He didn't speak, but his eyes stared into my face, trying to find some compassion. It was a rare commodity in this world.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hide under the ridge. I ordered, pushing him into position. "When the hound comes be ready with your spear and we will attack it together."[PARAGRAPH:1]He hid under the ridge and I slipped away. A few minutes later the hound stopped howling, it was close.[PARAGRAPH:1]The hound was drawn to the figures fear as I had suspected. I watched as it walked up to the top of the ridge and stopped to sniff and listen. Even I could sense the man's fear, I knew it was like a beacon to the hound. In one smooth movement the hound leapt off the ridge and in front of the man, he called for my help as he braced his spear.[PARAGRAPH:1]I ignored him as the hound attacked, tearing quickly into the man. I wasn't interested in the hound or the man. I waited until I saw him. A black figure wreathed in violet flames, the hunter following after the hound. As he passed I leapt out, shoving the spike into the hunters neck.[PARAGRAPH:1]The sound he made was a mix of pleasure and pain, the scream of a sadist in the ecstasy of mutilation. He was stronger than I suspected, and the spike jutting from his neck didn't slow him at all. He lifted one arm and tossed me aside. I rolled and came to my feet to see him ready for his next attack. The hound dragged the body of the man back towards us, and the deep red eyes of the rest of the hellhound pack came out of the wastes. There was at least a dozen of them. The hunter didn't bother removing the spike from his neck.[PARAGRAPH:1]A crow passed over us. Seeing it in hell was as unusual as seeing a demon flying by in Erebus. But the effect on the hunter and his hounds was immediate. They fled in all directions, even leaving the prize of the wizened man behind.[PARAGRAPH:1]The crow landed. It was large for a crow but not unnaturally so. It clawed at the ground and hopped about ignoring me. I had lost the spike and without any sort of weapon I knew I was helpless. Remembering the man's spear I started to slip by, to avoid the crow and get to base of the ridge where the hellhound and the man fought.[PARAGRAPH:1]Then I noticed what the crow had scratched. It was a fire rune with broken bindings. The crow looked at me for the first time.[PARAGRAPH:1]It was exactly like the rune I had made, perfectly formed. I walked closer and the crow crooked its head watching me. I took a breath and reached out to the rune and I immediately felt the power well up inside of me. Balefire flooded out of the rune in great wild gouts. It flowed out between the hills of the wastes, down along the ridge and all around me. At the rune itself it reached up like a fountain of yellow fire, a bright finger reaching into the sky.[PARAGRAPH:1]This was the power I once had. Let the hunters come, let them bring their packs of hellhounds, the torturers and the war machines of hell. I will purge this horrific world.[PARAGRAPH:1]The crow was gone. In its place, floating weightless just above the ground was a beautiful woman wearing purple robes. The robes floated about her in a maze of folds that hid her and offered tantalizing glimpses of her perfect pale skin. Half of an obsidian mask covered the left side of her face. On the right her lips were full and red, her eyes matched the deep purple of her robes.[PARAGRAPH:1]"To long have you dwelled in these lands."[PARAGRAPH:1]The fire collapsed back into the rune. I felt the power slip from me and I gasped and fell to my knees in an effort to keep hold of it. But it was pulled from me and I was weak again. I screamed, it was as cruel as anything I had suffered here.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Give it back." I threatened, realizing that I didn't have a weapon.[PARAGRAPH:1]Her eyes narrowed dangerously. Her body twisted and she expanded, or the world shrank, until she filled the sky and her robes surrounded me.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I am Ceridwen" she said and the ground rumbled with her voice, "and I can drop you into worlds far worse than this one. If you wish to be free you will worship me, for I am the only one who can break your chains."[PARAGRAPH:1]And I fell to the ground and worshipped her.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]I had forgotten how beautiful creation was, or I had paid little attention. The island I walked across was ripe and lush. There were no land animals on it, just brightly colored birds that cried and fluttered away in annoyance as I walked by.[PARAGRAPH:1]A vast well stood at the center of the island. Far enough across that a galleon could have been dropped down it and it was deeper than the world. The rocks around it appeared to be old granite, but I knew that rock was the foundation of creation and was much stronger than simple granite. There were no animals here.[PARAGRAPH:1]I began walking around the well. Every few feet I stopped to trace a rune on the rock. Though it seemed a minor effect, and I was more powerful than I had ever been in life, it took all of my willpower to mar the rock. Between runes I rested and went over Ceridwen's demands, making sure each step was done exactly as she described.[PARAGRAPH:1]By the time I had walked the entire way around it was well into the night. I stood on the last rock ready to trace the final rune. But before that I drew silver letters on a black cloth, cast and then placed the cloth over my eyes. Through it I saw the spirit world. Even now spirits of the dead walked across the island and threw themselves into the well, passing from this world to the world beyond.[PARAGRAPH:1]Then I completed the final rune. In a screeching that brought back painful memories of Camulos's hell the rock began to move together. The well began to close.[PARAGRAPH:1]Confused spirits rushed toward the well, seeing their afterlife being stolen from them and from within the well I heard the sound of feathers. A cold wind came up out of the well and I saw a figure flying up at me from the wells depths. A woman with a cloth over her eyes much as mine, and ragged bands woven around her arms and into a tattered dress. She had dark wings and pale ivory skin. She was like moonlight filtered through a canopy of branches.[PARAGRAPH:1]But she was not fast enough. I reached out and pulled all of the surrounding spirits towards me, funneling them all into the final rune that was being sketched over the closing rocks surface. A barrier held fast, a great mirror that would send those who tried to pass through it back, a transformation that would bind the spirits that passed through it into unholy forms.[PARAGRAPH:1]The spirits powered the rune, they were trapped within it. They howled and fought the rune but they could not escape.[PARAGRAPH:1]To test the spell I walked to a nearby apple tree, since the birds didn't come this close to the well its fruit was untouched. But it was early in the year and it only had tiny green apples hanging from its branches.[PARAGRAPH:1]I traced a rune of withering on its trunk and the tree immediately shriveled and died. The tiny apples fell from the branches as the branches thinned and weakened. For a moment nothing happened, and then the tree filled out again. Not to its original height, as it remained dark and warped by the spell, but it was not completely dead. On its branches new small fruit blossomed, but this time they were a deep brownish red and they beat slowly.[PARAGRAPH:1]My mission had begun. My deal with Ceridwen, to bring Armageddon to creation starts here. If I fail I will return to the eternal prison of hell, and even if it means destroying the world I will never again suffer hells torments.</English>

There were no animals here.[PARAGRAPH:1]I began walking around the well. Every few feet I stopped to trace a rune on the rock. Though it seemed a minor effect, and I was more powerful than I had ever been in life, it took all of my willpower to mar the rock. Between runes I rested and went over Ceridwen's demands, making sure each step was done exactly as she described.[PARAGRAPH:1]By the time I had walked the entire way around it was well into the night. I stood on the last rock ready to trace the final rune. But before that I drew silver letters on a black cloth, cast and then placed the cloth over my eyes. Through it I saw the spirit world. Even now spirits of the dead walked across the island and threw themselves into the well, passing from this world to the world beyond.[PARAGRAPH:1]Then I completed the final rune. In a screeching that brought back painful memories of Camulos's hell the rock began to move together. The well began to close.[PARAGRAPH:1]Confused spirits rushed toward the well, seeing their afterlife being stolen from them and from within the well I heard the sound of feathers. A cold wind came up out of the well and I saw a figure flying up at me from the wells depths. A woman with a cloth over her eyes much as mine, and ragged bands woven around her arms and into a tattered dress. She had dark wings and pale ivory skin. She was like moonlight filtered through a canopy of branches.[PARAGRAPH:1]But she was not fast enough. I reached out and pulled all of the surrounding spirits towards me, funneling them all into the final rune that was being sketched over the closing rocks surface. A barrier held fast, a great mirror that would send those who tried to pass through it back, a transformation that would bind the spirits that passed through it into unholy forms.[PARAGRAPH:1]The spirits powered the rune, they were trapped within it. They howled and fought the rune but they could not escape.[PARAGRAPH:1]To test the spell I walked to a nearby apple tree, since the birds didn't come this close to the well its fruit was untouched. But it was early in the year and it only had tiny green apples hanging from its branches.[PARAGRAPH:1]I traced a rune of withering on its trunk and the tree immediately shriveled and died. The tiny apples fell from the branches as the branches thinned and weakened. For a moment nothing happened, and then the tree filled out again. Not to its original height, as it remained dark and warped by the spell, but it was not completely dead. On its branches new small fruit blossomed, but this time they were a deep brownish red and they beat slowly.[PARAGRAPH:1]My mission had begun. My deal with Ceridwen, to bring Armageddon to creation starts here. If I fail I will return to the eternal prison of hell, and even if it means destroying the world I will never again suffer hells torments.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[TAB]The Age of Ice was a paradise compared to what I endured. As men huddled in frozen caves, and the Bannor raced across the plains of ash in Agares hell I was held underneath the fractured surface of Camulos's hell.[PARAGRAPH:1]Camulos is the god of war, and his hell is the proving ground for new demons. Here they learn the arts of chaotic battle in the unending wars that rage across its surface. The souls, once moral, become desensitized to feeling and inflicting pain. Then they begin to delight in it, cruelly destroying anyone weaker than them across the volcanic terrain.[PARAGRAPH:1]Beneath the wars, in pits regularly opened or consumed by the violent earthquakes that shake the world, are the vast prisons where the victims of war are kept. I had suffered through the mire of Mulcarn, passed the trials of Mammon's great city but I was a quick victim to violence of this realm.[PARAGRAPH:1]Torturers usually want something from their victims, secrets, cooperation or conversion. But here they subjected us to anguish only to enjoy our suffering. And in a world without the escape of death, there was no hope of an end to the torment. You bleed and scream for centuries.[PARAGRAPH:1]The eruptions occasionally open new tunnels in the prisons, collapsing walls allow the imprisoned to flee to the world's surface and escape their torment for a time.[PARAGRAPH:1]After one of these I fled into wastes, where the sand cut through exposed flesh like small shards of glass. I huddled beneath the hide of a pit beast and gripped one of the back spikes from the beast as a crude weapon. My magic failed me in hell. I traced a rune in the sand, a fire sign with broken bindings and willed it alive. A faint flame flickered within it. When I was alive I could have summoned torrents of fire out of the rune, I could have assaulted a city with it. Now it only flickered weakly.[PARAGRAPH:1]Howls interrupted my concentration. Demons avoided battles in the wastes, but hunters lead by hellhounds would come through looking for those, like myself, that sought refuge here. I brushed away the rune and started deeper into the wastes.[PARAGRAPH:1]By they were faster than I was and the hound could smell me. They didn't follow scent like moral dogs, they could smell fear and there was no escaping them. As I scrambled across another ridge a darkened figure rushed at me, spear in hand. He was emaciated, weak, and I easily knocked the spear aside.[PARAGRAPH:1]I pulled the man to the ground, he was trembling, and whispered into his ear.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You will be okay" I lied, "I won't hurt you, but we have to kill the hound that is coming for us."[PARAGRAPH:1]He didn't speak, but his eyes stared into my face, trying to find some compassion. It was a rare commodity in this world.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hide under the ridge. I ordered, pushing him into position. "When the hound comes be ready with your spear and we will attack it together."[PARAGRAPH:1]He hid under the ridge and I slipped away. A few minutes later the hound stopped howling, it was close.[PARAGRAPH:1]The hound was drawn to the figures fear as I had suspected. I watched as it walked up to the top of the ridge and stopped to sniff and listen. Even I could sense the man's fear, I knew it was like a beacon to the hound. In one smooth movement the hound leapt off the ridge and in front of the man, he called for my help as he braced his spear.[PARAGRAPH:1]I ignored him as the hound attacked, tearing quickly into the man. I wasn't interested in the hound or the man. I waited until I saw him. A black figure wreathed in violet flames, the hunter following after the hound. As he passed I leapt out, shoving the spike into the hunters neck.[PARAGRAPH:1]The sound he made was a mix of pleasure and pain, the scream of a sadist in the ecstasy of mutilation. He was stronger than I suspected, and the spike jutting from his neck didn't slow him at all. He lifted one arm and tossed me aside. I rolled and came to my feet to see him ready for his next attack. The hound dragged the body of the man back towards us, and the deep red eyes of the rest of the hellhound pack came out of the wastes. There was at least a dozen of them. The hunter didn't bother removing the spike from his neck.[PARAGRAPH:1]A crow passed over us. Seeing it in hell was as unusual as seeing a demon flying by in Erebus. But the effect on the hunter and his hounds was immediate. They fled in all directions, even leaving the prize of the wizened man behind.[PARAGRAPH:1]The crow landed. It was large for a crow but not unnaturally so. It clawed at the ground and hopped about ignoring me. I had lost the spike and without any sort of weapon I knew I was helpless. Remembering the man's spear I started to slip by, to avoid the crow and get to base of the ridge where the hellhound and the man fought.[PARAGRAPH:1]Then I noticed what the crow had scratched. It was a fire rune with broken bindings. The crow looked at me for the first time.[PARAGRAPH:1]It was exactly like the rune I had made, perfectly formed. I walked closer and the crow crooked its head watching me. I took a breath and reached out to the rune and I immediately felt the power well up inside of me. Balefire flooded out of the rune in great wild gouts. It flowed out between the hills of the wastes, down along the ridge and all around me. At the rune itself it reached up like a fountain of yellow fire, a bright finger reaching into the sky.[PARAGRAPH:1]This was the power I once had. Let the hunters come, let them bring their packs of hellhounds, the torturers and the war machines of hell. I will purge this horrific world.[PARAGRAPH:1]The crow was gone. In its place, floating weightless just above the ground was a beautiful woman wearing purple robes. The robes floated about her in a maze of folds that hid her and offered tantalizing glimpses of her perfect pale skin. Half of an obsidian mask covered the left side of her face. On the right her lips were full and red, her eyes matched the deep purple of her robes.[PARAGRAPH:1]"To long have you dwelled in these lands."[PARAGRAPH:1]The fire collapsed back into the rune. I felt the power slip from me and I gasped and fell to my knees in an effort to keep hold of it. But it was pulled from me and I was weak again. I screamed, it was as cruel as anything I had suffered here.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Give it back." I threatened, realizing that I didn't have a weapon.[PARAGRAPH:1]Her eyes narrowed dangerously. Her body twisted and she expanded, or the world shrank, until she filled the sky and her robes surrounded me.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I am Ceridwen" she said and the ground rumbled with her voice, "and I can drop you into worlds far worse than this one. If you wish to be free you will worship me, for I am the only one who can break your chains."[PARAGRAPH:1]And I fell to the ground and worshipped her.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]I had forgotten how beautiful creation was, or I had paid little attention. The island I walked across was ripe and lush. There were no land animals on it, just brightly colored birds that cried and fluttered away in annoyance as I walked by.[PARAGRAPH:1]A vast well stood at the center of the island. Far enough across that a galleon could have been dropped down it and it was deeper than the world. The rocks around it appeared to be old granite, but I knew that rock was the foundation of creation and was much stronger than simple granite. There were no animals here.[PARAGRAPH:1]I began walking around the well. Every few feet I stopped to trace a rune on the rock.
