		<English>[H2]Part 1: Bellowing Embers[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]The population of Braduk the Burning had swelled to ten times normal. Orcs were here that Pugg hadn't seen in the last year. They gathered around the Sacred Flame, more for shelter from the raging blizzard than as worship. Pugg squeezed in between two burly orcs in front of him, who grunted but let the goblin pass. Finally he was warm enough, and could hear the priestess as well.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Oh great Bhall, goddess of fire, shield us and guide us! Listen to your daughters! Give strength to our spear-arms, and let our enemies feel the searing heat of our hate!" The Orcs and goblins hushed their rowdy conversations, leaning closer to participate in the ritual. "Let your fire follow in our wake!" they intoned, rattling their spears.[PARAGRAPH:1]The priestess continued her petition, with the orcs repeating their part as prompted, awaiting the climax of the ritual. Soon it came, as the priestess called out, "Bring forth the sacrifice!" The crowd around the fire parted, allowing the priestess' servants entrance. Grown male orcs, they were nearly naked despite the unending winter and painted from head to toe in mystic symbols. Between the three pairs they carried the sacrifice: three human soldiers. Striped of any valuables, their tattered rags still showed bits and pieces of the Bannor emblem. Despite the constant conflict, it was rare for their hated foes to be taken alive.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pugg jeered and yelled along with the rest, tossing a clod of dirt at one human. His aim was off, and he hit one of the Bhall-Orcs instead, who looked down at him as he passed and hissed at him, showing off his tongueless mouth. Pugg recoiled.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Here, Oh Goddess, taste our devotion!" One by one the human captives were thrown into the large fire-pit, started by the sacred flame itself. They writhed as they cooked, shouting muffled screams until their gags burned away. Then their screams drowned out even the Orcs raucous cheering. "Oh great goddess, show us your wishes!" shouted the priestess, bowing low before the flames. The assembled crowd did likewise.[PARAGRAPH:1]As had happened at the previous sacrifice, and the one before that, they waited and watched. Finally, the priestess stood and turned to the assembly. "Bhall has given us a sign, in gratitude for our sacrifice of the hated humans. She blesses our plans, and gives consent to the will of her priestesses."[PARAGRAPH:1]"That's not what I see, hag." Orcs gasped to hear such a word used here, at the sacred circle. A heavily armored and battle scarred Orc approached the priestess while the rest bowed. Or most of the rest, as here and there in the crowd, and especially around the Bhall-Orcs, a few hearty Orcs stood with spear in hand. They wore deerskin cloaks matching the speaker's. "I see the old Crone giving no signs. I see a people full of courage and fury being led by an old woman, who sacrifices the spoils of others."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jonas of Three-Spear tribe," hissed the old woman. There was no need to shout now. The crowd, hundreds strong, uttered not a word. "How dare you blaspheme at this-"[PARAGRAPH:1]"At this what? Sacred Fire? Braduk is not the sign of Bhall's power, it is her pyre. And you, witch woman, can join her in her death." A quick shove and the ancient Orc was in the fire-pit by the remains of the war captives. She died quickly and silently. At the same time, Jonas' allies quickly dispatched the Bhall-Orcs. "You see? It was not blessings that gave the women authority over the warriors, but lies!" As he was speaking, a tremendous thunderclap was heard from far to the north, and the blizzard ended suddenly. "See? Bhall resented having her voice only spoken by weak women." He grabbed the arm of a small girl huddled wide-eyed by the fire. "The priestess' apprentice. Being trained to dominate the strong Orcs with women's lies. What do you say?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Caught up in the revolution, the crowd chanted "Give her to Bhall!" And Jonas did. Into the flame went the girl with a scream. Unlike the human soldiers, her scream did not quiet as her flesh was consumed, but intensified, shrieking ever louder. Her thrashing slowed as her body burned, and her voice grew deeper. Finally, her eyes, rolled back in pain, turned to face Jonas even as the flames licked them.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jonas Endain!" She roared. The feared warrior went pale and sank to his knees. "My daughters have made their sacrifices... but what of you?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"My... my Goddess..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Take me from the flames, Jonas."[PARAGRAPH:1]The Orc chieftain stepped into the fire with teeth clenched, and took the girls head in his hands. Her body, nearly ashes, fell away. His cloak caught on fire, and his skin began to darken and blister, but he walked back out slowly, holding the head with both hands. "I have been... inattentive to my people in the mortal realm, Jonas. But this does not excuse your blasphemy."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Take my life, Bhall," whispered Jonas.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I shall," spoke the head. The flames continued, but the head was not consumed. "But not to bring to me. You shall be my instrument, Jonas. My first Priest. You will lead my people as you intended, but your glory shall fall to me alone. Lest you forget that your life is my tool, this head, and this girl's scream, will follow you to your death. Now prepare, my people. My foe is gone, and winter is over. It is time for the new age to begin. And to begin in flames."[PARAGRAPH:1]Five thousand Orcs raised their spears and roared.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELLOWING_EMBERS_2]Part 2: Bellowing Embers[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELLOWING_EMBERS_3]Part 3: Bellowing Embers[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LEADER_HAFGAN]Part 4: Bellowing Embers[\LINK]</English>
		<French>[H2]Les Braises Hurlantes, Chapitre 1[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]La population de Braduk a crû jusqu'à atteindre dix fois la normale. Les Orcs se trouvaient à des endroits où Pugg ne les avait pas vus depuis un an. Ils s'agglutinaient autour de la Flamme Sacrée, plus à la recherche d'un abri contre le blizzard féroce que pour un culte. Pugg se faufila entre deux orcs gras  qui lui faisaient face, et qui grognèrent mais laissèrent le gobelin passer. Il finit par atteindre un endroit suffisamment chauffé et d'où il pouvait entendre la prêtresse.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Oh, grande Bhall, déesse du feu, protège-nous et guide-nous ! Entends l'appel de tes filles ! Donne nous de la force pour notre bras armé, et laisse nos ennemis sentir la chaleur brûlante de notre haine !" Les Orcs et les gobelins firent silence, se rapprochant pour participer au rituel. "Fais que ton feu suive nos traces !" entonnèrent-ils en entrechoquant leurs lances.[PARAGRAPH:1]La prêtresse continua ses oraisons, les orcs répétant leurs paroles quand il fallait, attendant l'apogée du rituel. Elle vint rapidement, tandis que la prêtresse demanda à haute voix : "Amenez le sacrifice !". La foule assemblée autour du feu se scinda, permettant l'entrée des servants de la prêtresse. Orcs adultes mâles, ces derniers étaient pratiquement nus malgré l'hiver perpétuel, et couverts de la tête aux pieds de symboles mystiques peints. Par trois paires d'entre eux était porté le sacrifice : trois soldats humains. Dépouillés de tout ce qui avait une quelconque valeur, leurs guenilles en lambeaux laissaient entrevoir des morceaux de l'emblème Bannor. Malgré le conflit incessant, il était rares que certains d'entre eux fussent faits prisonniers vivants.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pugg cria et hua avec les autres, lançant un morceau de terre sur un des humains. Il visa mal et toucha un des Orcs-Bhall à la place, qui le toisa et lui siffla dessus tandis qu'il passait, révélant sa bouche sans langue. Pugg eut un mouvement de recul.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Voici, ma Déesse, goûte notre dévotion !" Un par un, les prisonniers humains furent jetés dans le grand brasier, initialement embrasé par la flamme sacrée elle-même. Ils se débattirent tandis qu'ils cuisaient, lançant des hurlements étouffés jusqu'à ce que leurs baillons brûlent. Puis leurs cris couvrirent même les accalmations rauques des Orcs. "Oh grande déesse, montre nous ta volonté !" cria la prêtresse, s'inclinant bas devant les flammes. La foule fit de même.[PARAGRAPH:1]Comme lors du sacrifice précédent et celui d'avant, ils attendirent et observèrent. Finalement, la prêtresse se releva et se tourna vers l'assemblée. "Bhall nous a donné un signe, par gratitude pour notre sacrifice de ces humains haïs. Elle bénit nos plans, et confirme la volonté de ses prêtresses."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ce n'est pas ce que je vois, sorcière." Les Orcs étaient stupéfaits d'entendre un tel mot ici, dans le cercle sacré. Un Orc vétu d'une lourde armure et couvert de cicatrices de guerre approcha de la prêtresse tandis que les autres s'inclinèrent. Ou plutôt que presque tous les autres, tandis que ça et là, et particulièrement autour des Orcs-Bhall, quelques Orcs courageux se tenaient droits, lance en main. Ils portaient des manteaux en peaux de cerfs ressemblant à celui de l'orateur. "Je vois la vieille bique ne donnant aucun signe. Je vois un peuple empli de courage et de furie guidé par une vieille femme qui sacrifie les prises des autres."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jonas de la tribu des Trois-Lances", siffla la vieille femme. Il n'y avait plus aucune raison de crier. La foule, forte de plusieurs centaines d'individus, se pipait mot. "Comment oses-tu blasphémer en un tel -"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Un tel quoi ? Feu Sacré ? Braduk n'est pas le symbole de la puissance de Bhall, mais son bûcher. Et toi, sorcière, peut la rejoindre dans la mort." Une poussée vive et l'ancienne Orc était dans le brasier aux côtés des restes des prisonniers de guerre. Elle mourut rapidement et silencieusement. Pendant ce temps, les alliés de Jonas dispersèrent rapidement les Orcs-Bhall. "Vous voyez ? Ce n'étaient pas des bénédictions qui permettaient aux femmes de dominer les guerriers mais des mensonges !" Tandis qu'il parlait, un formidable coup de tonnerre retentit  loin dans le nord, et le blizzard s'arrêta soudain. " Vous voyez ? Bhall s'offusquait que sa voix ne soit portée que par de faibles femmes." Il attrapa le bras d'une petite fille recroquevillée près du feu, les yeux écarquillés. "L'apprentie de la prêtresse. Entraînée à dominer les Orcs forts à l'aide de mensonges de femmes. Qu'as-tu à dire ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Entraînée dans la révolution, la foule chanta : "Donne-la à Bhall !" Et ainsi fit Jonas. Avec un cri, la fille fut précipitée dans les flammes. Contrairement aux soldats humains, son cri ne s'arrêta pas tandis que sa chair se consummait, mais s'intensifiait, poussant des cris perçants de plus en plus fort. Ses mouvements ralentirent tandis que son corps brûlait, et sa voix devint plus profonde. Finalement, ses yeux révulsés par la douleur se tournèrent pour faire face à Jonas alors même que les flammes les léchaient.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jonas Endain !" gronda-t-elle. Le guerrier craint devint pâle et tomba à genoux. "Mes filles ont fait leurs sacrifices... Mais et toi ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ma... ma Déesse..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sors moi des flammes, Jonas."[PARAGRAPH:1]Le chef de clan Orc s'avança dans le feu les dents serrées, et prit la tête de la fille dans ses mains. Son corps, presque des cendres, s'effondra. Son manteau prit feu, et sa peau commença à s'assombrir se cloquer, mais il recula doucement, tenant la tête à deux mains. "J'ai été... inattenttive vis à vis de mon peuple dans les royaumes mortels, Jonas. Mais ça n'excuse pas ton blasphème."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Prends ma vie, Bhall," murmura Joans.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Je devrais" répondit la tête. Les flammes perduraient mais la tête ne se consummait pas. "Mais pas pour t'amener à moi. Tu seras mon instrument, Jonas. Mon premier prêtre. Tu guideras mon peuple comme tu comptais le faire, mais ta gloire me reviendra à moi seule. Pour que tu n'oublies pas que ta vie est mon outil, cette tête et ce cri de cette fille te suivront jusqu'à la mort. Maintenant prépare-toi, mon peuple. Mon adversaire n'est plus, et l'hiver se termine. Il est temps de commencer un nouvel âge. Et de le commencer dans les flammes."[PARAGRAPH:1]Cinq mille Orcs levèrent leurs lances et rugirent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELLOWING_EMBERS_2]Les Braises Hurlantes, Chapitre 2[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELLOWING_EMBERS_3]Les Braises Hurlantes, Chapitre 3[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LEADER_HAFGAN]Les Braises Hurlantes, Chapitre 4[\LINK]</French>
		<German>[H2]Part 1: Bellowing Embers[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]Die Bevölkerung von Braduk the Burning schwoll auf die zehnfache normale Größe an. Viele der Orks hier hatte Pugg im letzten Jahr nicht gesehen. Sie versammelten sich um die Heilige Flamme, allerdings mehr um Unterschlupf vor dem wütenden Schneesturm zu finden als aus Verehrung. Pugg quetschte sich zwischen zwei kräftige Orks hindurch, die zwar grunzten aber den Goblin passieren ließen. Schließlich war ihm warm genug und er konnte auch die Priesterin hören.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Oh großartige Bhall, Göttin des Feuers, schütze uns und führe uns! Höre deine Töchter! Gib unseren Speerarmen Kraft und lass unsere Feinde die schneidende Hitze unseres Hasses spüren!" Die Orks und Goblins dämpften ihre rauhen Gespräche, neigten sich näher um am Ritual teilzunehmen. "Lasse Dein Feuer auf unsere Totenwache folgen!" stimmten sie mit den Speeren scheppernd an.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Priesterin führte ihr Gesuch fort, während die Orks ihren Teil wie vorgesagt wiederholten und den Höhepunkt des Rituals erwarteten. Es war soweit als die Priesterin ausrief: "Bringt das Opfer hervor!" Die Menge rund um das Feuer teilte sich und gewährte den Dienern der Priesterin Einlass. Erwachsene Orkmänner, sie waren nahezu nackt trotz der endlosen und von Kopf bis zu den Füßen mit mystischen Symbolen bemalten Haut. Zwischen den drei Paaren trugen sie die Opfergabe: drei menschliche Soldaten. Allem Wertvollen beraubt zeigten ihre zerrissenen Lumpen immer noch Fetzen des Bannor-Emblems. Trotz des immerwährenden Konflikts war es ungewöhnlich, dass sie ihre gehassten Feinde lebend fingen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Pugg johlte und brüllte mit dem Rest, und schleuderte einen Klumpen Dreck auf einen der Menschen. Er verfehlte sein Ziel und traf stattdessen einen der Bhall-Orks, der ihn im Verbeigehen erblickte und anfauchte und mit seinem zungenlosen Maul prahlte. Pugg schreckte zurück.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hier, oh Göttin, koste unsere Andacht!" Die menschlichen Gefangenen wurden einer nach dem anderen in die große Feuerstelle geworfen, entzündet durch die Heilige Flamme selbst. Sie krümmten sich in den Flammen, stießen gedämpfte Schreie aus bis ihre Knebel verbrannt waren. Dann übertönten ihre Schreie sogar das rauhe Jubeln der Orks. "Oh große Göttin, zeig uns dein Begehren!" rief die Priesterin, in tiefer Verbeugung vor den Flammen. Die versammelte Menge tat es ihr gleich.[PARAGRAPH:1] Wie schon bei der letzten Opferung und auch der davor, warten und beobachteten sie. Schließlich stand die Priesterin auf und drehte sich der Versammlung zu. "Bhall hat uns ein Zeichen gegeben, in Dankbarkeit für unsere Opfergabe der gehassten Menschen. Sie segnet unsere Vorhaben und gibt ihre Zustimmung zum Willen ihrer Priesterinnen." [PARAGRAPH:1]"Das ist nicht was ich sehe, Hexe." Die Orks keuchten als sie die Worte hörten, am heiligen Zirkel Ein schwer gepanzerter, mit Narben aus der Schlacht bedeckter Ork näherte sich der Priesterin während sich der Rest verbeugte. Eher der größte Teil, hier und dort blieben einige wackere Orks mit ihrem Speer in der Hand stehen, vor allem nahe der Bhall-Orks.. Sie trugen Mäntel aus Rehleder im Abgleich mit der Rednerin. "Ich sehe keine Zeichen vom alten Weib. Ich sehe ein Volk voller Wut und Tapferkeit, das von einer alten Frau geführt wird, die die Beute anderer opfert."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jonas vom Stamm der Drei Speere," zischte die alte Frau. Zu schreien war nicht mehr nötig. Die Menge, hunderte starke Orks, äußerten kein Wort. "Ihr wagt es, eure Blasphemie über dieses-"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Dieses was? Heilige Feuer? Braduk ist nicht das Signum von Bhalls Macht, es ist ihr Scheiterhaufen.  Und Ihr, Hexenweib, könnt euch ihr im Tod anschließen. "Ein schneller Schubs und die altehrwürdige Orkfrau lag in der Feuerstelle zwischen den Überresten der Gefangenen. Sie starb schnell und leise. Zur selben Zeit fertigen die Verbündeten Jonas' die Bhall-Orks ab. "Seht ihr? Es war nicht der Segen, der der Frau die Autorität über die Krieger gab, sondern Lügen!" Während er sprach konnte man einen enormen Donnerschlag aus dem fernen Norden hören und der Schneesturm endete urplötzlich. "Seht ihr? Bhall grollt, dass ihre Stimme nur durch eine schwache Frau gehört wurde." Er griff nach dem Arm eines kleinen Mädchens, das mit großen Augen am Feuer kauerte. "Lehrling der Priesterin. Geschult, die starken Orks mit den Lügen einer Frau zu dominieren. Was sagt Ihr?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Von der Revolution angestachelt rief die Menge "Schickt sie zu Bhall!" Und dem entsprach Jonas. Das Mädchen ging unter Gekreisch in die Flammen. Anders als bei den Menschen verstummten ihre Schreie nicht als ihr Fleisch verzehrt wurde, sondern intensivierten sich und schrillten immer lauter. Ihr Zucken verlangsamte sich während ihr Körper verbrannte und ihre Stimme wurde tiefer. Schlussendlich verdrehten sich ihre Augen unter Schmerzen und ihr Gesicht wandte sich Jonas zu obgleich die Flammen es erreichten.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jonas Endain!" brüllte sie. Die gefürchteten Krieger wurden blass und sanken auf ihre Knie. "Meine Töchter haben ihr Opfer dargebracht ... aber was ist mit Euch?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Meine... meine Göttin..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Nehmt mich aus den Flammen, Jonas."[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Ork-Häuptling schritt die Zähne zusammenbeißend in das Feuer und nahm den Kopf des Mädchens in die Hände. Ihr Körper, nahezu nur noch Asche, zerfiel. Sein Mantel fing Feuer und seine Haut begann sich zu verdunkeln und Blasen zu werfen, aber er ging langsam zurück und hielt den Kopf mit beiden Händen. "Ich war...meinem Volk im Reich der Sterblichen gegenüber, Jonas. Aber das entschuldigt nicht Eure Blasphemie." [PARAGRAPH:1]"Nehmt mein Leben, Bhall," flüsterte Jonas.[PARAGRAPH:1] "Das sollte ich," sprach der Kopf. Die Flammen wüteten weiter aber der Kopf  wurde nicht verzehrt. "Aber ich nehme es nicht zu mir. Du sollst mein Instrument sein, Jonas. Mein erster Priester. Du wirst mein Volk führen wie du es vorgesehen hast, doch dein Ruhm soll nur auf mich zurückfallen. Damit du nicht vergisst, dass dein Leben mein Werkzeug ist, werden dir Kopf und Schreie dieses Mädchens bis in den Tod folgen. Mach dich nun bereit, mein Volk. Mein Feind ist gegangen, der Winter ist vorüber. Es ist Zeit, dass ein neues Zeitalter beginnt. Und zwar in Flammen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Fünf tausend Orks rissen ihre Speere empor und brüllten.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELLOWING_EMBERS_2]Part 2: Bellowing Embers[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELLOWING_EMBERS_3]Part 3: Bellowing Embers[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LEADER_HAFGAN]Part 4: Bellowing Embers[\LINK]</German>

"But not to bring to me. You shall be my instrument, Jonas. My first Priest. You will lead my people as you intended, but your glory shall fall to me alone. Lest you forget that your life is my tool, this head, and this girl's scream, will follow you to your death. Now prepare, my people. My foe is gone, and winter is over. It is time for the new age to begin. And to begin in flames."[PARAGRAPH:1]Five thousand Orcs raised their spears and roared.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELLOWING_EMBERS_2]Part 2: Bellowing Embers[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELLOWING_EMBERS_3]Part 3: Bellowing Embers[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LEADER_HAFGAN]Part 4: Bellowing Embers[\LINK]</Spanish>

		<English>[LINK=LORE_BELLOWING_EMBERS_1]Part 1: Bellowing Embers[\LINK][H2]Part 2: Bellowing Embers[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]The battle was fierce, but the Bannor men proved true. Turin was called up from the reserves, and he gathered his relics and poultices assuming he was needed to tend the wounded. Alas, the body they presented to him was beyond his or his god's help.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Turin..." Aethil begin, "we found it in the fire-pit. I'm sorry, my friend." The guardsman held out his hand, displaying the tiny bracelet with the Acolyte's family crest. Turin grabbed it and pushed past him, kneeling before the fire-pit. The blood of orcs and men, mingled with the melting snow soaked though his pants as he cradled the tiny skull he found there in his hands.[PARAGRAPH:1]"My Jessua..." he murmured. The hope had been small, but it had been, and now it died at the sight of his daughter's ashes.[PARAGRAPH:1]"At least these Orcs will take no more sacrifices," Aethil said, wiping his saber and surveying the wasted camp. "Though we're likely to find another camp here as soon as we turn our back."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Lieutenant!" A warrior approached them, a bundle in his arms. "This one's still alive."[PARAGRAPH:1]Aethil grabbed the Orc child by the leg, holding it up to examine as the wrappings fell to the trampled earth. "A girl. Damned ugly, but definitely a girl. Turin, take it. Kill it, you'll feel better."[PARAGRAPH:1]Turin took the child from his friend, cradling it in his arms as he had his own. "This girl did not kill my own. No justice is served by her death."[PARAGRAPH:1]"It is a corruption, a blight. You'll be saving someone else's child from the ravages of the beasts she'll spawn."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Aethil, she's a baby!"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Fine, leave it here to die by the wind and the wolves. Or were you planning on raising it yourself?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The priest had already wrapped the child his own fur cloak. "I shall, then Aethil. And we'll see how she takes to civilization. If law and goodness can be taught, maybe our relentless war could end."[PARAGRAPH:2]"Confessor Turin! Come in, come in. I was so sorry to hear about your wife."[PARAGRAPH:1]Turin ran a hand through his hair and sighed. "Yes. We had dreamed of living to see the end of Winter together... I guess she gets to see green pastures... before I do." Turin let the Adept lead him to a chair by the fireplace, and they sat for a moment in silence. "How go your studies, Pharsalus?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Good news at last. Official sanction from Torrolerial and Sabathiel himself, so they say. We may continue our studies on the mana we have uncovered as long as it aids the war and contributes to the land's law and peace."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Well, then, I have a favor to ask you. My.... The Orc child-"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, how is she?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I fear I was overly optimistic. She has grown demanding and selfish, barely able to toddle around, just learning our speech, and it's no' this and no' that. It seems her chaotic nature asserts herself. With the passing of my wife, it is becoming so difficult to raise her, between that and my duties. But I'd hate to have to send her out."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jessua... she died at what age?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"She'd been just weaned when they took her. What are you implying?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Simply that perhaps you don't have the experience to judge this Orc child. Many children are-"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No. My sweet Jessua would not do the things this child does!"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Very well, my friend, what is the favor?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I heard rumors of a spell you have uncovered. One that can touch minds and bind loyalties. Cast this on my child."[PARAGRAPH:1]Pharsalus sighed. "I should protest that it is extremely experimental, but I know better than to try to dissuade you. I could do it here and now, if you had a clump of hair or some other part of her."[PARAGRAPH:1]Turin pulled out a small fang and held it up. "She just lost a tooth."[PARAGRAPH:1]The Adept took it and walked to the next room, bare of furniture except for shelves of reagents and a perfectly round fire-pit carved out of the stone floor. He picked a few ingredients out, added the tooth, and started the fire. In went an item now and then as he intoned words, some in the common language, some in a more ancient tongue, ending with, "Qualum en noctum et solum nivum sheelba!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Turin watched from the doorway, uncertain that the ritual was over until Pharsalus turned to him. "It is done. The spell will be strengthened whenever you repeat that last word in her presence."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sheelba."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes. It is from her native tongue. Forsaken. Whether in night or day, never to be forsaken.'"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thank you my friend. I shudder to think what would become of me if I raised a wild Orc in the heart of the Tor Elyr."[PARAGRAPH:2]Wild celebration was occurring throughout the civilized world, and the home of the High Priest of Tor Elyr was no exception. "To those that didn't make it to this day," Turin toasted his friends with the finest wine. The windows had been thrown wide open, letting in not the chill winds of winter but the gentle breezes of spring, at last. The city guard Captain chugged his down in one swig.[PARAGRAPH:1]"More! Might as well finish this vintage Turin, the coming harvest is sure to make a much better wine."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Indeed, my friend." Turin rose to satisfy Aethil's request.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sit, sit. Why do you bother to get up when you have this Orc here to do your chores?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"It isn't..." Turin sat. "Sheelba, get some more wine for our friend."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes father." As she left, Turin drained his own glass, adding it to the pile of empties.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You let her call you that? Father!'" Aethil spat the word. "You're not her father. I know, I probably killed him myself, 12, 13 years ago was it now?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Aethil! Please, this is a happy time," Pharsalus interrupted, spilling wine down the front of his robes.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I suppose you dress her up in Kiradia's clothing? Call her little Sheelba Jessua Stonelaw do you? It's vulgar, I tell you."[PARAGRAPH:1]"It isn't... she's not... She's not my daughter, Aethil, I know that. Keeping her here amuses me, alright? Better than out pillaging isn't it?" Turin averted his gaze from his friend's eyes when he said it.[PARAGRAPH:1]"It is if she ever manages to bring back that wine." Aethil got up and staggered towards that kitchen. "Girl! The men are thirsty here!" Turin and Pharsalus followed him. They found the wine sitting on the kitchen counter and the back door wide open. A quick search showed the girl missing.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Where is she?" Turin asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I think... I think she heard us talking, Turin," Pharsalus said. "I think she heard you and ran off..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"She can't leave me! She's all I have!" He turned to the mage. "Pharsalus, I said your word every day, so much so she thought it was her name! Where's your Loyalty spell now?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"My what? You mean... way back then? That was ten years ago! I was but an adept then, and I told you the spell was still experimental!"[PARAGRAPH:1]"So it wore off?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, it never took effect. I had the reagents wrong. I thought I told you..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Of course it took effect! From that day on she never left my side! She became the most true and loyal daughter I'd ever seen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Aethil saw that anguish in his friend's eyes, and it momentarily overcame his hate for the people he had fought against all his life. "Turin, don't you see? See wasn't loyal because she was ensorcelled! She grew up! She became your daughter once you began treating her like she was going to stay with you, rather than always looking for some glimmer of rebellion in her."[PARAGRAPH:1]The confessor fell to his knees, grasping his graying hair. "Good gods, what have I done?"[PARAGRAPH:2]She ran out of the village, tearing away the trappings of civilization. Words escaped her, and she let out a roar, rushing through the dense jungle. She was nearly naked by the time he grabbed her.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Gotcha! Hey, you aren't human," the huge Orc said.[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, no I'm not, am I?" Sheelba shook herself free. "I'm not, and he's not my father, and they mean nothing to me, they can burn they can all burn!" She beat the chest of the Orc in front of her with each word. Out of breath, she finally collapsed at his feet. He lifted her up.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I am Rantine of the Ember Clans. Who are you?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I am Sheelba."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Come, Sheelba, I will take you home."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELLOWING_EMBERS_3]Part 3: Bellowing Embers[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LEADER_HAFGAN]Part 4: Bellowing Embers[\LINK]</English>
		<French>[LINK=LORE_BELLOWING_EMBERS_1]Les Braises Hurlantes, Chapitre 1[\LINK][H2]Les Braises Hurlantes, Chapitre 2[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]La bataille faisait rage, mais les guerriers Bannors n'en démordaient pas. Turin fut mandé depuis le réserves, et il rassembla ses reliques et ses cataplasmes en supposant qu'il était appelé à soigner les blessés. Hélas, le corps qu'ils lui montrèrent dépassait ses moyens ou ceux de son dieu.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Turin..." commença Aethil, "nous l'avons trouvé dans le brasier. Je suis désolé mon ami." Le garde ouvrit la main, révélant le petit bracelet frappé des armoiries de la famille de l'Acolyte. Turin le prit et le serra contre lui, s'agenouillant devant le brasier. Le sang des orcs et des hommes, mélangés avec la neige fondue imbibait son pantalon tandis qu'il berçait dans ses mains le petit crâne trouvé ici.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ma Jessua..." murmura-t-il. L'espoir avait été faible, mais il avait existé. Et il s'était éteint à la vue des cendres de sa fille.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Au moins ces Orcs ne prendront plus de sacrifices," dit Aethil, nettoyant son sabre et surveillant le camp dévasté. "Même si nous trouverons ici un autre camp dès que nous arurons tourné le dos."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Lieutenant !" Un guerrier s'approcha, un paquet dans les bras. "Celui-là est encore en vie."[PARAGRAPH:1]Aethil attrapa l'enfant Orc par la jambe, le maintenant pour l'examiner tandis que les langes tombaient sur le sol maculé. "Une fille. Horriblement moche, mais clairement une fille. Turin, prends la. Tue la, tu te sentiras mieux."[PARAGRAPH:1]Turin prit l'enfant tenu apr son ami, le berçant dans ses bras comme il l'aurait fait avec le sien. "Cette fille n'a pas tué la mienne. Il n'y a aucune justice dans sa mort."[PARAGRAPH:1]"C'est une corruption, un fléau. Tu t'occuperas de sauver l'enfant d'autres des ravages bestiaux qu'elle causera."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Aethil, c'est un bébé !"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Bien, laisse la là pour mourir du vent et des loups. Ou as-tu l'intention de l'élever toi-même ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Le prêtre avait déjà emmitouflé l'enfant dans son manteau de fourrure. "Je le ferai donc, Aethil. Et nous verrons comment elle s'adapte à la civilisation. Si la loi et la bonté peuvent être apprises, peut-être notre guerre sans répit pourrait prendre fin."[PARAGRAPH:2]"Confesseur Turin ! Venez, venez. J'ai été tellement triste d'apprendre pour votre femme."[PARAGRAPH:1]Turin passa une main dans ses cheveux et soupira. "Oui. Nous avions rêvé de vivre pour voir ensemble la fin de l'Hiver... Je suppose qu'elle verra de verts pâturages... avant moi." Turin laissa l'Adepte le mener à une chaise près de l'âtre, et ils s'assirent un moment en silence. "Comment se passent tes études, Pharsalus ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Enfin de bonnes nouvelles. Approbation officielle de Torrolerial et Sabathiel lui-même, à ce qu'on dit. Nous pourrions poursuivre nos études sur le mana récupéré tant qu'elles contribuent à la gagner la guerre et à la loi et la paix du pays."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Bien, dans ce cas j'ai une faveur à te demander. Ma... L'enfant Orc -"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Oui, comment va-t-elle ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Je pense que j'ai été un peu trop optimiste. Elle devient de plus en plus exigente et égoïste, à peine capable de marcher à pas héstants dans les environs, apprenant à peine notre langage, et c'est du 'non ceci' et 'non cela'. sa nature chaotique s'affirme. Avec la mort de ma femme, c'est devenu très difficile de l'élever, entre ça et mes études. Mais je détesterais avoir à la renvoyer."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jessua... À quel âge est-elle morte ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Elle venait d'être sevrée quand ils l'ont prise. Qu'est-ce que tu sous-entends ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]" Simplement que tu n'as peut-être pas l'expérience pour juger cet enfant Orc. Beaucoup d'enfants sont -"(PARAGRAPH:1]"Non. Ma douce Jessua n'aurait pas fait ce que cet enfant fait !"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Très bien mon ami, quelle est cette faveur ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"J'ai entendu des rumeurs à propos d'un sort que vous auriez redécouvert. Un qui affecte les esprits et lie les loyautés. Lance-le sur mon enfant."[PARAGRAPH:1]Pharsalus soupira. "Je devrais protester en disant qu'il est extrêmement expérimental, mais je connais un moyen plus efficace que d'essayer de te dissuader. Je pourrais le faire ici et maintenant, si tu as en ta possession une mèche de cheveux ou un autre bout d'elle."[PARAGRAPH:1]Turin sortit un petit croc et lui tendit. "Elle vient de perdre une dent."[PARAGRAPH:1]L'Adepte le prit et alla dans l'autre pièce, nue à l'exception d'étagères de réactifs et un petit foyer parfaitement rond creusé dans le sol de pierre. Il saisit quelques ingrédients, y ajouta la dent, et alluma le feu. Il les introduisait dans un objet tout en entonnant des mots, certains dans la langue commune, d'autres dans une langue plus ancienne, et finissant par, "Qualum en noctum et solum nivum Sheelba!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Turin regardait depuis l'encadrement de la porte, ne sachant pas si le rituel était terminé jusqu'à ce que Pharsalus se tourne vers lui. "C'est fait. Le sort se renforcera chaque fois que tu répèteras ce dernier mot en sa présence."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sheelba."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Oui. Ça vient de sa langue natale. Abandonnée. 'Le jour comme la nuit, tu ne seras jamais abandonnée'."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Merci mon ami. Je frémis à l'idée de ce qui serait advenu de moi si j'avais élevé une Orc sauvage en plein c&#156;ur du Tor Elyr."[PARAGRAPH:2]Des festivités endiablées se déroulaient dans tout le monde civilisé, et la maison du Haut-Prêtre du Tor Elyr n'y faisait pas exception. "À ceux qui n'ont pas survécu jusqu'à ce jour," Turin régalait ses amis du vin le plus fin. Les fenêtres avaient été grandes ouvertes, non pas pour laisser entrer le vent froid de l'hiver mais les douces brises du printemps. Le capitaine des gardes de la cité vida le sien cul-sec.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Encore ! On ferait aussi bien de terminer ce vieux vin Turin, la récolte à venir en fera à coup sûr du bien meilleur."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Bien sûr, mon ami". Turin se leva pour satisfaire la demande d'Aethil.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Assieds-toi, assis. Pourquoi prends-tu la peine de te lever quand tu as cette Orc pour effectuer les corvées ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ce n'est pas..." Turin s'assit. "Sheelba, va chercher un peu plus de vin pour notre ami."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Oui père." Tandis qu'elle s'en allait, Turin finit son verre, l'ajoutant à la pile des verres vides.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Tu la laisses t'appeler ainsi ? 'Père !'" Aethil cracha le mot. "Tu n'es pas son père. Je le sais, je l'ai probablement tué moi-même, il y a de ça quoi, 12 ou 13 ans."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Aethil ! S'il te plait, c'est un moment de fête," l'interrompit Pharsalus, reversant du vin sur sa robe.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Je suppose que tu l'habilles avec les vêtements de Kiradia ? Appelle la petite Sheelba Jessua Pierreloi tant qu'à faire. C'est vulgaire, je te le dis."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ce n'est pas... Elle n'est pas... Elle n'est pas ma fille, Aethil, je le sais. La garder ic m'amuse, d'accord ? Toujours mieux que d'être dehors à piller, non ?" Turin avait détourné son regard des yeux de son ami tout en parlant.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ça sera le cas si elle parvient un jour à rapporter ce vin." Aethis se leva et tituba vers la cuisine. "Fille ! Les hommes ont soif par cii !" Turin et Pharsalus le suivirent. Ils trouvèrent le vin gisant sur le comptoir de la cuisine et la porte de derrière grande ouverte. Une rapide fouille montra que la fille manquait à l'appel.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Où est-elle ?" demanda Turin.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Je pense... Je pense qu'elle nous a entendus parler, Turin," dit Pharsalus. "Je pense qu'elle t'a entendu et s'est enfuie..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Elle ne peut pas me quitter ! Elle est tout ce que j'ai !" Il se tourna vers le mage. "Pharsalus, j'ai prononcé ton mot chaque jour, tellement qu'elle a cru que c'était son nom ! Où est ton sort de Loyauté maintenant ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Mon quoi ? Tu veux dire... à ce moment là ? C'était il y a dix ans ! Je n'étais alors qu'un Adepte, et je t'ai dit que le sort était encore expérimental !"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Donc il a prit fin ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Non, il n'a jamais eu d'effet. Je n'avais pas les bons réactifs. Je pensais te l'avoir dit..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Bien sûr qu'il a agi ! Depuis ce jour elle ne m'a jamais quitté ! Elle est devenue la plus franche et loyale fille que j'ai jamais vue."[PARAGRAPH:1]Aethil vit cette angoisse dans les yeux de son ami, et elle outrepassa momentanément sa haine pour le peuple qu'il a combattu toute sa vie. "Turin, tu ne vois pas ? Elle n'a jamais été loyale parce qu'elle était ensorcelée ! Elle a grandi ! Elle est devenue ta fille quand tu as commencé à la traiter comme si elle allait rester avec toi, plutôt que de toujours chercher en elle les germes de la rébellion."[PARAGRAPH:1]Le confesseur tomba à genoux, agrippant ses cheveux grisonannts. "Oh dieux, qu'ai-je fait ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Elle s'enfuit du village, s'achappant des pièges de la civilisation. Les mots lui échappaient, et elle poussa un rugissement, courant au travers de la jungle dense. Elle était presque nue quand il l'attrapa.[PARAGRAPH:1]"J't'ai eue ! Hé, tu n'es pas humaine," dit l'immense Orc.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Non, non je ne le suis pas, n'est-ce pas ?" Sheelba se libéra. "Je ne le suis pas, et il n'est pas mon père, et ils ne signifient rien pour moi, ils peuvent tous brûler, ils peuvent tous brûler !" Elle heurta le torse de l'Orc en face à chaque mot. Hors d'haleine, elle s'effondra à ses pieds. Il la releva.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Je suis Rantine du Clan des Braises. Qui es-tu ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Je suis Sheelba."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Viens, Sheelba, je te ramène à la maison."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELLOWING_EMBERS_3]Les Braises Hurlantes, Chapitre 3[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LEADER_HAFGAN]Les Braises Hurlantes, Chapitre 4[\LINK]</French>
		<German>[LINK=LORE_BELLOWING_EMBERS_1]Part 1: Bellowing Embers[\LINK][H2]Part 2: Bellowing Embers[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]Die Schlacht nahm heftige Ausmaße an, doch die Männer Bannors waren erprobt genug. Turin wurde aus der Reserve ab berufen, um die Verwundeten zu versorgen. Alas, der Körper welchen sie ihm Präsentierten, war bereits außerhalb seiner Hilfe, oder der seines Gottes.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Turin..." begann Aethil, "wir fanden es in der Flammengrube. Es tut mir leid mein Freund." Der Wachmann streckte seine Hand aus und stellte das kleine Armband mit dem kleinen Acolytischem Familienkamm zur Schau. Turin ergriff es und presste es fest an sich während er vor der Feuergrube kniete. Das Blut von Orks und Menschen mischte sich mit dem schmelzenden Schnee und triefte durch seine Hose, während er denn kleinen Schädel zwischen seinen Händen hin und her schaukelte.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jessua, meine Jessua..." murmelte er. Seine Hoffnung war klein gewesen doch sie war da und nun war sie beim Anblick der Asche seiner Tochter gestorben.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Diese Orks werden nun keine weiteren Opfer mehr machen," sprach Aethil während er seinen Säbel abwischte und das alte verwüstete Camp untersuchte. "Ich denke wir sollten uns am besten sobald wir umkehren ein anderes Camp suchen."[PARAGRAPH:1] "Leutnant!" Ein Krieger erreichte sie, ein Bündel zwischen seinen Armen. "Dieses hier lebt noch."[PARAGRAPH:1]Aethil nahm das Orkjunge am Bein hoch um es genauer zu betrachten, wobei die Umschläge auf die plattgetrampelte Erde fielen. "Ein Mädchen. Verdammt hässlich, doch definitiv ein Mädchen. Turin, nimm es. Töte es und du wirst dich besser fühlen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Turin nahm das Kind von seinem Freund und hielt es in seinen Armen wie sein eigenes Kind. "Dieses Mädchen, tötete nicht das meine. Mit ihrem Tod wird keine Gerechtigkeit verübt."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Es ist eine Korruption der Natur, eine trockene Fäule. Du rettest das Kind eines anderen, vor den  von dieser Bestie ausgehenden Gräueln."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Aethil sie ist ein Baby!"[PARAGRAPH:1"Gut, lass es hier um es von Wind und Wölfen töten zu lassen. Oder möchtest du es als dein eigenes ansehen?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Priester hatte es jedoch schon längst wie sein eigenes, in seinen Mantel gehüllt. "Ich tue es Aethill. Und wir werden sehen, wie sie sich in die Zivilisation einfügen wird. Falls Gesetz und Gutmütigkeit gelehrt werden können, könnte vielleicht auch dieser Unsinnige Krieg enden."[PARAGRAPH:2]"Beichtvater Turin! Kommt, kommt herein. Es tut mir so leid, als ich die Nachricht über eure Frau hörte."[PARAGRAPH:1]Turin strich mit einer Hand durch sein Haar und antwortete. "Ja. Wir haben immer davon geträumt das Ende des Winters gemeinsam zu erleben... Ich denke sie wird die grünen Weiden schon eher zu sehen bekommen,  bevor ich sie sehen werde" Turin ließ sich von einem Adepten zu einem Stuhl nahe der Feuerstelle weisen und sie saßen für einen Moment ganz still da. "Wie geht es mit deinen Studien voran Pharsalus?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ganz gut ich habe etwas tolles zu berichten. Wir erhielten die offizielle Erlaubnis, von Torrolerial und Sabathiel höchstpersönlich, wie sie sagen. Wir dürfen unsere Studien mit dem von uns entdeckten Mana solange fortsetzen, wie es dem Krieg dienlich ist und dem Land Frieden und Gesetz bringt."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Gut nun, ich habe das Bedürfnis dich zu fragen. Mein... das Ork Kind"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ja wie geht es ihr?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich fürchte ich war zu Optimistisch. Ihre Ansprüche sind gewachsen, genauso wie ihr Egoismus. Einzig unsere Sprache ist sie am Lernen. Es scheint so als ob ihre chaotische Natur, sie langsam aber sicher überkommt. Seit dem vergehen meiner Frau, ist es sehr schwer geworden, sie nach meinen Pflichten zu Erziehen. Doch ich hasse es sie nach draußen zu schicken."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jessua... sie starb in welchem Alter?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sie wurde nur entführt als sie, sie gefangen haben. Was willst du damit andeuten?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Einfach das du vielleicht nicht die richtige Erfahrung besitzt dieses Orkkind zu erziehen. Viele Kinder"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Nein. Meine süße Jessua würde keine der Sachen tun die dieses Kind tut."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sehr gut, mein Freund was ist das Problem?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich hörte das Gerüchte eines von dir entdeckten Zauberspruches. Einem der Gedächtnisse berühren und Loyalitäten binden kann. Wirkt ihn auf mein Kind."[PARAGRAPH:1]Pharsalus sah sich um. "Ich sollte es besser wissen und einwenden dass dieser Spruch höchst experimentell ist, doch nützt es nichts dir zu widersprechen. Ich kann es hier und jetzt tun, falls du einen Fetzen Haar oder etwas anderes von ihr hier hast."[PARAGRAPH:1]Turin holte ein kleines Büschel heraus. "Sie verliert in letzter Zeit sehr viel."[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Adept nahm es und ging in den nächsten Raum herüber, einem Raum ausgekleidet mit Bildern hoher Regenten und in der Mitte gesäumt von einer Feuerstelle. Er holte ein paar Utensilien heraus, vereinte sie mit dem Büschel und entzündete das Feuer. Nun schmiss er sie ins Feuer und sprach nun Worte, manche in der hiesigen Sprache andere in einer mehr Antiken Sprache, welche mit "Qualum en noctum et solum nivum sheelba!" endeten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Turin beobachtete ihn aus dem Türahmen heraus, unwissend das, das Ritual schon vorbei war als Pharsalus sich zu ihm herum drehte. "Es ist getan. Der Zauber wird immer stärker sobald du die letzten von mir gesprochenen Worte in ihrer Gegenwart wiederholst."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sheelba."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ja es stammt aus ihrer Zunge. Verlassen. Ob am Tage oder in der Nacht, sie wird dich niemals verlassen."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Danke dir mein Freund. Mir graut es davor was mit mir passieren würde, falls ein wilder Ork im Herzen von Tor Elyr sein Unwesen Treiben würde."[PARAGRAPH:2]Wilde Bräuche traten überall in der zivilisierten Welt auf und die Heimat der Hohepriester, Tor Elyr war keine Ausnahme. "Bleibt zu hoffen das wir es nicht zu diesen Tag kommen lassen". Turin verkostete seinen Freunden die Edelsten Weine. Die Fenster waren weit aufgeschlagen, ließen jedoch keinen Windzug des Winters, sondern einzig die Frische Brise des Frühlings herein. Der Kapitän der Stadtwachen, schluckte den seinen mit einem Schluck herunter.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Mehr! Um diese Weinlese abzuschließen, verspricht die kommende Ernte einen noch besseren Wein."[PARAGRAPH:1]"In der Tat mein Freund." Turin versuchte seiner Anfrage auszuweichen.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Setzt euch setzt euch, warum macht ihr euch die ganze mühe wenn ihr diesen Ork hier habt, der euch die ganze Arbeit abnehmen kann?[PARAGRAPH:1]Es ist nicht... Sheelba hol doch bitte etwas mehr Wein für unseren Freund.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ja Vater." Als sie ging, setzte Turin sein nun ebenfalls leeres Glas ab. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Du lässt sie dich so nennen?' Vater!" Aethil spuckte die Worte förmlich heraus. "Du bist nicht ihr Vater! Ich weiss dass ich sie 12 oder 13 Jahre zuvor, vielleicht selber getötet hätte."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Aethil bitte dies ist nicht die rechte Zeit zum streiten". Pharsalus unterbrach ihn und setzte sein Weinglas vor seiner Robe ab.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich schätze du kleidest sie in Kiradias alten Kleidern? Nennst du sie kleine Sheelba Jessua Stonelaw? Tust du das? Ich sage dir es ist einfach nur vulgär."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ist es nicht... sie ist nicht... ich weiss das sie nicht meine Tochter ist Aethil. Sie hier zu behalten amüsiert mich verstanden? Besser als sie Plündern zu lassen oder? Als Turin das sagte wendete er seinen Blick von dem seines Freundes ab.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Es scheint so als ob sie ewig braucht diesen Wein zu holen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Aethil stand auf und ging Richtung Küche, die beiden anderen folgten ihm. "Hey Mädchen, die Männer hier sind durstig." Sie sahen den Wein, alleine auf der Fensterbank stehen und die Hintertür weit aufgeschlagen. Eine kurze Suche offenbarte, das verschwinden des Mädchens.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Wo ist sie?" fragte Turin.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich denke... ich denke, sie hat uns sprechen hören." sprach Pharsalus. "Ich denke sie hörte dich und rannte fort..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sie kann mich nicht verlassen! Sie ist alles was ich habe!" Er drehte sich zum Magier um. "Pharsalus, ich sagte deine Worte jeden Tag, so oft das sie annahm es sei ihr Name! Wo ist euer Loyalitätsspruch jetzt?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"Mein was? Du meinst...  Das war vor zehn Jahren! Ich war nur ein Adept und sagte dir dass der Spruch so experimentell war!"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Also hat er seine Wirkung verloren?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Nein er zeigte niemals Wirkung. Ich benutzte flache Zutaten. Ich dachte ich sag es dir..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Natürlich zeigte er Wirkung! Von dem Tag an, an dem der Spruch gewirkt wurde wich sie nie von meiner Seite! Sie wurde die Treueste und Liebste Tochter die mir jemals untergekommen ist.[PARAGRAPH:1]Aethil sah die Qual in den Augen seines Freundes und für einen kurzen Moment überkam ihn der Hass gegen die Leute die er sein ganzes Leben über bekämpft hatte. "Turin siehst du es nicht? Sie war nicht Treu weil sie Verzaubert wurde, sie ist gewachsen. Sie wurde zu deiner Tochter, weil du sie so behandelt hast. Hast du nie den Schimmer von Rebellion in ihr gesehen?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Beichtvater fiel auf die Knie und griff sich durch das Graue Haar. "Oh um Gottes willen was habe ich getan?"[PARAGRAPH:2]Sie rannte aus dem Dorf, die Zeichen der Zivilisation wurden immer undeutlicher. Ihr entwichen Wörter und sie brachte ein lautes Brüllen heraus, während sie durch den Dschungel eilte. Sie war nahezu nackt als er sie ergriff.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hab ich dich! Hey du bist kein Mensch" sagte der riesige Ork bei ihrem Anblick.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Nein, nein bin ich nicht, bin ich? Sheelba befreite sich vom Griff des Ork. "Nein bin ich nicht und er ist nicht mein Vater und sie bedeuten mir nichts, sie können Brennen, sie können alle Brennen!" Sie schlug bei jedem Wort auf  die Brust des Ork. Außer Atem brach sie schließlich vor den Füßen des Orks zusammen. Er half ihr auf.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich bin Rantine Mitglied des Klans der Asche und wer bist du?[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich bin Sheelba."[PARAGRAPH:1]Nun denn komm Sheelba, ich werde dich zurück nach Hause bringen".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELLOWING_EMBERS_3]Part 3: Bellowing Embers[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LEADER_HAFGAN]Part 4: Bellowing Embers[\LINK]</German>
		<Italian>[LINK=LORE_BELLOWING_EMBERS_1]Part 1: Bellowing Embers[\LINK][H2]Part 2: Bellowing Embers[\H2][PARAGRAPH:1]The battle was fierce, but the Bannor men proved true. Turin was called up from the reserves, and he gathered his relics and poultices assuming he was needed to tend the wounded. Alas, the body they presented to him was beyond his or his god's help.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Turin..." Aethil begin, "we found it in the fire-pit. I'm sorry, my friend." The guardsman held out his hand, displaying the tiny bracelet with the Acolyte's family crest. Turin grabbed it and pushed past him, kneeling before the fire-pit. The blood of orcs and men, mingled with the melting snow soaked though his pants as he cradled the tiny skull he found there in his hands.[PARAGRAPH:1]"My Jessua..." he murmured. The hope had been small, but it had been, and now it died at the sight of his daughter's ashes.[PARAGRAPH:1]"At least these Orcs will take no more sacrifices," Aethil said, wiping his saber and surveying the wasted camp. "Though we're likely to find another camp here as soon as we turn our back."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Lieutenant!" A warrior approached them, a bundle in his arms. "This one's still alive."[PARAGRAPH:1]Aethil grabbed the Orc child by the leg, holding it up to examine as the wrappings fell to the trampled earth. "A girl. Damned ugly, but definitely a girl. Turin, take it. Kill it, you'll feel better."[PARAGRAPH:1]Turin took the child from his friend, cradling it in his arms as he had his own. "This girl did not kill my own. No justice is served by her death."[PARAGRAPH:1]"It is a corruption, a blight. You'll be saving someone else's child from the ravages of the beasts she'll spawn."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Aethil, she's a baby!"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Fine, leave it here to die by the wind and the wolves. Or were you planning on raising it yourself?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The priest had already wrapped the child his own fur cloak. "I shall, then Aethil. And we'll see how she takes to civilization. If law and goodness can be taught, maybe our relentless war could end."[PARAGRAPH:2]"Confessor Turin! Come in, come in. I was so sorry to hear about your wife."[PARAGRAPH:1]Turin ran a hand through his hair and sighed. "Yes. We had dreamed of living to see the end of Winter together... I guess she gets to see green pastures... before I do." Turin let the Adept lead him to a chair by the fireplace, and they sat for a moment in silence. "How go your studies, Pharsalus?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Good news at last. Official sanction from Torrolerial and Sabathiel himself, so they say. We may continue our studies on the mana we have uncovered as long as it aids the war and contributes to the land's law and peace."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Well, then, I have a favor to ask you. My.... The Orc child-"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, how is she?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I fear I was overly optimistic. She has grown demanding and selfish, barely able to toddle around, just learning our speech, and it's no' this and no' that. It seems her chaotic nature asserts herself. With the passing of my wife, it is becoming so difficult to raise her, between that and my duties. But I'd hate to have to send her out."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jessua... she died at what age?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"She'd been just weaned when they took her. What are you implying?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Simply that perhaps you don't have the experience to judge this Orc child. Many children are-"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No. My sweet Jessua would not do the things this child does!"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Very well, my friend, what is the favor?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I heard rumors of a spell you have uncovered. One that can touch minds and bind loyalties. Cast this on my child."[PARAGRAPH:1]Pharsalus sighed. "I should protest that it is extremely experimental, but I know better than to try to dissuade you. I could do it here and now, if you had a clump of hair or some other part of her."[PARAGRAPH:1]Turin pulled out a small fang and held it up. "She just lost a tooth."[PARAGRAPH:1]The Adept took it and walked to the next room, bare of furniture except for shelves of reagents and a perfectly round fire-pit carved out of the stone floor. He picked a few ingredients out, added the tooth, and started the fire. In went an item now and then as he intoned words, some in the common language, some in a more ancient tongue, ending with, "Qualum en noctum et solum nivum sheelba!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Turin watched from the doorway, uncertain that the ritual was over until Pharsalus turned to him. "It is done. The spell will be strengthened whenever you repeat that last word in her presence."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sheelba."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes. It is from her native tongue. Forsaken. Whether in night or day, never to be forsaken.'"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thank you my friend. I shudder to think what would become of me if I raised a wild Orc in the heart of the Tor Elyr."[PARAGRAPH:2]Wild celebration was occurring throughout the civilized world, and the home of the High Priest of Tor Elyr was no exception. "To those that didn't make it to this day," Turin toasted his friends with the finest wine. The windows had been thrown wide open, letting in not the chill winds of winter but the gentle breezes of spring, at last. The city guard Captain chugged his down in one swig.[PARAGRAPH:1]"More! Might as well finish this vintage Turin, the coming harvest is sure to make a much better wine."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Indeed, my friend." Turin rose to satisfy Aethil's request.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sit, sit. Why do you bother to get up when you have this Orc here to do your chores?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"It isn't..." Turin sat. "Sheelba, get some more wine for our friend."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes father." As she left, Turin drained his own glass, adding it to the pile of empties.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You let her call you that? Father!'" Aethil spat the word. "You're not her father. I know, I probably killed him myself, 12, 13 years ago was it now?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Aethil! Please, this is a happy time," Pharsalus interrupted, spilling wine down the front of his robes.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I suppose you dress her up in Kiradia's clothing? Call her little Sheelba Jessua Stonelaw do you? It's vulgar, I tell you."[PARAGRAPH:1]"It isn't... she's not... She's not my daughter, Aethil, I know that. Keeping her here amuses me, alright? Better than out pillaging isn't it?" Turin averted his gaze from his friend's eyes when he said it.[PARAGRAPH:1]"It is if she ever manages to bring back that wine." Aethil got up and staggered towards that kitchen. "Girl! The men are thirsty here!" Turin and Pharsalus followed him. They found the wine sitting on the kitchen counter and the back door wide open. A quick search showed the girl missing.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Where is she?" Turin asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I think... I think she heard us talking, Turin," Pharsalus said. "I think she heard you and ran off..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"She can't leave me! She's all I have!" He turned to the mage. "Pharsalus, I said your word every day, so much so she thought it was her name! Where's your Loyalty spell now?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"My what? You mean... way back then? That was ten years ago! I was but an adept then, and I told you the spell was still experimental!"[PARAGRAPH:1]"So it wore off?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, it never took effect. I had the reagents wrong. I thought I told you..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Of course it took effect! From that day on she never left my side! She became the most true and loyal daughter I'd ever seen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Aethil saw that anguish in his friend's eyes, and it momentarily overcame his hate for the people he had fought against all his life. "Turin, don't you see? See wasn't loyal because she was ensorcelled! She grew up! She became your daughter once you began treating her like she was going to stay with you, rather than always looking for some glimmer of rebellion in her."[PARAGRAPH:1]The confessor fell to his knees, grasping his graying hair. "Good gods, what have I done?"[PARAGRAPH:2]She ran out of the village, tearing away the trappings of civilization. Words escaped her, and she let out a roar, rushing through the dense jungle. She was nearly naked by the time he grabbed her.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Gotcha! Hey, you aren't human," the huge Orc said.[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, no I'm not, am I?" Sheelba shook herself free. "I'm not, and he's not my father, and they mean nothing to me, they can burn they can all burn!" She beat the chest of the Orc in front of her with each word. Out of breath, she finally collapsed at his feet. He lifted her up.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I am Rantine of the Ember Clans. Who are you?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I am Sheelba."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Come, Sheelba, I will take you home."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELLOWING_EMBERS_3]Part 3: Bellowing Embers[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LEADER_HAFGAN]Part 4: Bellowing Embers[\LINK]</Italian>

If the men here caught him, they would kill him. Just for who he was, though if they knew what he had done, they would make it slow and painful. He didn't blame them, Rantine was not ready to die by the Bannor-men's hands, not just yet. But he could not leave until he met his queen, or the dreams would continue.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dreams! He scoffed at himself. Being led so many leagues through the bitter cold, alone, by dreams. He was letting her control him, manipulate him again, and he knew it. But there was a line. He was not the orc he had been in his youth, rabid and bloodthirsty, eager for the excuse to rend flesh. Even an orc can tire of bathing in the blood of children, or at least this orc did. He had told her that many times as he traveled here, the last few months. There was a line he would not cross again, not even for her. Bhall did not answer him, except to continue the dreams.[PARAGRAPH:1]He became aware of sound, coming closer. Someone was running through the underbrush. Noisy, and right towards him. He sighed, and poised himself to strike. Not to kill. He knew how to take down a lone man without killing him, and the fool should expect worse from the rest of the jungle.[PARAGRAPH:1]It was not a human, rushing out of the Bannor village. It was an orc; a half naked orc girl. It was his queen, he knew at once, as the dread he had been feeling for so long vanished.[PARAGRAPH:2]Braduk the Burning was as easy to find as ever, no matter how long he had been away. The unnatural fire showed the way, day or night. And now, for some reason, no blizzards obscured his sight. His journey had been fraught with the perils of winter, perils he had known all his life. The short trip from the outlying Bannor holdings to the sacred city of the orcs bore him no such hardships. The air was warm. No rain fell, let alone snow. He actually felt warm, even without his furs, which Sheelba now wrapped around herself.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The men were celebrating the end of winter," she told him. Rantine nodded. Conversation was foreign to him, and this girl had no end of words. She made liberal use of them as they neared the city, telling bits and pieces of her life. But she was stunned into silence when they entered Braduk. Hundreds of orcs were arrayed before the flames, preparing for war. Sharpening spears, applying war paint, carving shields, harnessing wargs-everywhere was a flurry of activity. Rantine noticed the orcs arrayed around the banners of their clans. The Reindeer, the Forked Spear, the Bear... even two companies of lizard men. But above them all flew the banner of Embers. And that meant one thing to Rantine.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jonas."[PARAGRAPH:1]"What?" Sheelba clutched tightly to his arm as they began to be noticed.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jonas Endain will be here. When I left, he vowed to kill me."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Why?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I was once a hero among our people. But I tried to stop the war, to lead a clan of orcs into treaties with men and against the savagery of Orthus."[PARAGRAPH:1]Sheelba stared at him, confused.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The men never intended to make peace. The elders were slaughtered. I was... thanked and released."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rantine looked away, unable to meet Sheelba's gaze, but before she could question him further, an enormous orc entered the village followed by a lizardman scouting party. An orc with a girl's head attached to the shaft of a thick mace.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hello Jonas. What's happening?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I have united the Clans, Rantine. We are marching on the humans. Going to revenge your folly. Bhall has chosen me to lead. Stay out of my way." The orcs' Priest-King pushed past Rantine.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Wait-you can't do that!" Jonas turned to give Sheelba a contemptuous glare. "Every time you attack the Bannor, you die! I've seen it from their side. They win because they have bronze, they have iron, they have magics, and they have training! Throwing away orc lives in mindless raids will get you... will get us nothing! We need civilization to defeat men on their terms!"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Who is she?" Jonas asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]"She is your queen. And I... I will be your protector, Jonas, if you heed her. Otherwise, our people are doomed. I have seen it."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rantine expected to die. Any other Clan might have listened. The Jonas he knew would not take such provocation.[PARAGRAPH:1]Jonas seethed. He gripped the mace tighter. Then, "Come, the two of you. We will speak of this alone."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LEADER_HAFGAN]Part 4: Bellowing Embers[\LINK]</English>

Si les hommes l'attrapaient, ils le tueraient. Juste pour ce qu'il était. Pourtant, s'ils savaient ce qu'il avait fait, ils le feraient lentement et douloureusement. Il ne les blâmait pas, Rantine n'était pas prêt à mourir des mains humaines des Bannor, pas encore. Mais il ne pouvait pas partir sans avoir rencontré sa reine, ou les rêves continueraient.[PARAGRAPH:1]Les rêves ! Il se moqua de lui-même. Conduit sur tant de lieues dans le froid glacial, seul, par des rêves. Il la laissait le contrôler, le manipluler à nouveau, et il le savait. Mais il y avait une ligne. Il n'était plus l'orc de sa jeunesse, enragé et assoiffé de sang, avide d'excuses pour déchirer les chairs. Même un orc peut se fatiguer de se baigner dans le sang d'enfants, du moins cet Orc le pouvait. Il lui avait dit tellement de fois ces derniers mois, en voyageant jusqu'ici. Il y avait une ligne qu'il ne franchirait plus, même pour elle. Bhall ne lui avait pas répondu, si ce n'est en faisant se poursuivre ses rêves.[PARAGRAPH:1]Il perçut un bruit, se rapprochant. Quelqu'un courait dans les fourrés. Bruyamment, et droit sur lui. Il soupira et le prépara à frapper. Pas pour tuer. Il savait comment venir à bout d'un homme isolé sans le tuer, et seul le fou pourrait s'attendre à pire du reste de la jungle.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ce n'était pas humain, et s'échappait du village Bannor. C'était un Orc; une fille Orc à demi-nue. C'était sa reine, il le sut de suite, tandis que la crainte qu'il ressentait depuis si longtemps s'évanouissait.[PARAGRAPH:2]Braduk l'Enflammée était toujours aussi facile à trouver, aussi longtemps qu'il pût être parti. Le feu surnaturel montrait la voie, jour et nuit. Et maintenant, pour une raison quelconque, aucun blizzard n'obscurcissait la vue. Son voyage avait été rendu difficile par les dangers de l'hiver, dangers qu'il avait connus toute sa vie. Le court voyage des structures Bannors périphériques jusqu'à la ville sacrée des Orcs l'ennuya par l'absence de handicap. L'air était chaud. Aucune pluie, laissant seule la neige. En fait il avait chaud, même sans ses fourrures, maintenant enroulées autour de Sheelba.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Les hommes célébraient la fin de l'hiver," lui dit-elle. Rantine acquiesça. Les bavardages lui étaient inconnus, et cette fille semblait ne jamais être à court de mots. Elle en fit libre usage tandis qu'ils s'approchaient de la ville, racontant des parties de sa vie. Mais elle fut réduite au silence en entrant dans Braduk. Des centaines d'Orcs étaient alignés devant les flammes, se préparant à la guerre. Aiguisant les lances, appliquant les peintures de guerre, gravant les boucliers, harnachant les wargs. Partout se voyait une activité bouillonnante. Rantine nota que les orcs se rassemblaient sous les bannières de leurs clans. Le Renne, la Lance Fourche, l'Ours... et même deux compagnies d'hommes-lézards. Mais au-dessus de toutes ces bannières flottait la bannière des Braises. Et ça ne pouvai signifier qu'une chose pour Rantine.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jonas."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Quoi ?" Sheelba s'aggripa à son bras à mesure qu'ils se faisaient remarquer.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jonas Endain sera là. Quand je suis parti, il a fait le sermentde me tuer."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Pourquoi ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Je fus autrefois un héros pour mon peuple. Mais j'ai essayé d'arrêter la guerre, de conduire un clan d'Orcs à parlementer avec les hommes et contre la sauvagerie d'Orthus."[PARAGRAPH:1]Sheelba le dévisagea, confuse.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Les hommes n'ont jamais eu l'intention de faire la paix. Les anciens furent massacrés. J'ai été... remercié et relâché."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rantine détourna le regard, incapable de soutenir celui de Sheelba, mais avant qu'elle puisse lui poser des questions un énorme Orc entra dans la ville, suivi par un groupe d'éclaireurs hommes-lézards. Un orc avec une tête de fille attachée au manche d'une énorme masse.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Toi."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Bonjour Jonas. Que se passe-t-il ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"J'ai fédéré les clans, Rantine. Nous allons marcher sur les humains. Prendre notre revanche pour ta folie. Bhall m'a choisi pour les guider. Reste hors de mon chemin." Les Orcs du Prêtre-Roi dépassèrent Rantine.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Attends ! Tu ne peux pas faire ça !" Jonas se retourna pour jeter un regard méprisant à Sheelba. "Chaque fois que vous attaquez les Bannor vous mourez ! Je l'ai vu de leur point de vue. Ils gagnent car ils ont le bronze, ils ont le fer, ils ont la magie, et ils ont l'entraînement ! Gâcher des vies Orcs dans des raids insensés ne vous... ne nous conduira nulle part ! Nous avons besoin de la civilisation pour les battre sur leur terrain !"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Qui est-elle ?" demanda Jonas.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Elle est ta reine. Et je... je serai ton protecteur Jonas, si tu la reconnais. Sinon, notre peuple est condamné. Je l'ai vu."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rantine s'attendait à mourir. N'importe quel autre Clan aurait pu écouter, mais le Jonas qu'il connaissait ne résisterait pas à une telle provocation.[PARAGRAPH:1]Jonas écuma. Il serra encore plus le manche de sa masse. Puis, "Venez, vous deux. Nous parlerons de tout ça en privé."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LEADER_HAFGAN]Les Braises Hurlantes, Chapitre 4[\LINK]</French>

Die Männer hier hätten ihn getötet, wenn sie ihn gefasst hätten. Nur weil er war, der er war, aber hätten sie gewusst, was er getan hatte, hätten sie es langsam und schmerzvoll gemacht. Er gab ihnen keine Schuld, Rantine war nicht bereit, durch die Hände der Bannor zu sterben, nicht zu dieser Zeit. Aber er konnte nicht zurück, bevor er seine Königin gefunden hat, oder die Träume würden nicht enden.[PARAGRAPH:1]Träume! Er verspottete sich selbst. Durch Träume so weit weggeführt zu werden, in der beißenden Kälte, allein. Er ließ zu, dass sie ihn kontrollierte, ihn wieder beeinflusste, und er wusste es. Aber es gab eine Grenze. Er war nicht mehr derselbe Ork wie in seiner Jugend, blind vor Wut und blutdurstig, immer gierig nach einer Gelegenheit, Fleisch zu zerreißen. Sogar ein Ork kann müde werden, in Kinderblut zu baden, oder zumindest dieser Ork. Er hatte ihr das oft erzählt, als er in den letzten Monaten hier herreiste. Es gab eine Grenze, die er nie wieder übertreten würde, nicht einmal für sie. Bhall antwortete ihm nicht, außer um die Träume fortzuführen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Er bemerkte Geräusche, stetig näher kommend. Jemand rannte durch das Unterholz. Laut, und direkt in seine Richtung. Er seufzte und bereitete sich vor, zuzuschlagen. Nicht zu töten. Er wusste, wie man einen einzelnen Mann überwältigt, ohne ihn zu töten, und der Narr sollte Schlimmeres vom Rest des Dschungels erfahren.[PARAGRAPH:1]Es war kein Mensch, der aus dem Bannor-Dorf stürmte. Es war ein Ork; ein halbnacktes Ork-Mädchen. Sie war seine Königin, er wusste es in dem Moment, in dem die Scheu, die er so lange fühlte, schwand.[PARAGRAPH:2]Braduk the Burning war wie immer leicht zu finden, egal, wie lange er fort war. Das unnatürliche Feuer leuchtete den Weg, Tag und Nacht. Und nun, aus irgendeinem Grund, behinderten keine Schneestürme seine Sicht. Seine Reise war voll der Gefahren des Winters, Gefahren, die er schon sein gesamtes Leben lang kannte. Die kurze Reise von den äußeren Bannor-Gebieten zur heiligen Stadt der Orks boten keine solchen Erschwernisse. Die Luft war warm. Es fiel kein Regen, geschweige denn Schnee. Es war ihm sogar zu warm, auch ohne seine Felle, welche Sheelba nun um sich wickelte.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Die Männer feierten das Ende des Winters" erzählte sie ihm. Rantine nickte. Unterhaltung war ihm fremd, und dieses Mädchen hörte nicht auf zu reden. Sie machte freien Gebrauch von Wörtern, als sie sich der Stadt näherten, erzählte stückweise von ihrem Leben. Aber sie war sprachlos, als sie Braduk betraten. Hunderte Orks reihten sich vor den Flammen, in Vorbereitung auf den Krieg. Speere schärfend, Kriegsbemalung auftragend, Schilde schnitzend, Wargs anschirrend - überall war ein reges Treiben. Rantine bemerkte, dass die Orks sich bei den Bannern ihrer Clans aufreihten. Die Rentiere, der gespaltene Speer, der Bär... Sogar zwei Kompanien Echsenkrieger. Aber über ihnen allen schwebte das Banner des Klans der Asche. Und das bedeutete für Rantine nur eins.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jonas."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Was?" Sheelba umklammerte fest seinen Arm, als sie begannen, bemerkt zu werden.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jonas Endain wird hier sein. Als ich aufbrach, schwor er mich zu töten."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Weshalb?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich war einst ein Held unter meinem Volk. Aber ich versuchte, den Krieg zu beenden, einen Klan der Orks in Bündnissen mit den Menschen und gegen die Grausamkeit Orthus' zu führen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Sheelba starrte ihn verwirrt an.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Die Männer hatten nie die Absicht, Frieden zu schließen.  Die Ältesten wurden niedergemetzelt.  Mir wurde... gedankt und ich wurde entlassen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rantine schaute weg, unfähig, Sheelbas Blick zu entgegnen, aber bevor sie ihn weiter ausfragen konnte, betrat ein gewaltiger Ork die Stadt, gefolgt von einem Echsen-Spähtrupp. Ein Ork mit dem an den Schaft einer großen Keule angebrachten Kopfes eines Mädchens.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Du."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hallo Jonas.  Was ist passiert?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich habe die Klans vereint, Rantine. Wir marschieren gegen die Menschen. Werden deine Torheit rächen. Bhall hat mich als Anführer auserwählt. Geh mir aus dem Weg." Der orkische Priester-König drängte sich an Rantine vorbei.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Warte - Das kannst du nicht tun!" Jonas wandte sich mit einem verächtlichen Blick der Wut nach Sheelba um. "Jedes Mal, wenn ihr die Bannor angreift, sterbt ihr! Ich habe es von ihrer Seite gesehen. Sie gewinnen, denn sie haben Bronze, sie haben Eisen, sie haben Zauber und sie sind gut ausgebildet!! In sinnlosen Überfällen Orkleben wegzuwerfen wird euch... wird uns nichts bringen! Wir brauchen Kultur um die Menschen mit ihren eigenen Mitteln zu schlagen!"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Wer ist sie?" fragte Jonas.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sie ist deine Königin. Und ich... ich werde dich beschützen, Jonas, wenn du sie achtest. Ansonsten ist unser Volk dem Untergang geweiht. Ich habe es gesehen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rantine erwartete zu sterben. Jeder andere Klan hätte zugehört. Der Jonas, den er kannte, würde solch eine Provokation nicht hinnehmen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Jonas kochte. Er umfasste die Keule fester. Plötzlich, "Kommt, ihr beide. Wir werden allein darüber reden."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LEADER_HAFGAN]Part 4: Bellowing Embers[\LINK]</German>

If the men here caught him, they would kill him. Just for who he was, though if they knew what he had done, they would make it slow and painful. He didn't blame them, Rantine was not ready to die by the Bannor-men's hands, not just yet. But he could not leave until he met his queen, or the dreams would continue.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dreams! He scoffed at himself. Being led so many leagues through the bitter cold, alone, by dreams. He was letting her control him, manipulate him again, and he knew it. But there was a line. He was not the orc he had been in his youth, rabid and bloodthirsty, eager for the excuse to rend flesh. Even an orc can tire of bathing in the blood of children, or at least this orc did. He had told her that many times as he traveled here, the last few months. There was a line he would not cross again, not even for her. Bhall did not answer him, except to continue the dreams.[PARAGRAPH:1]He became aware of sound, coming closer. Someone was running through the underbrush. Noisy, and right towards him. He sighed, and poised himself to strike. Not to kill. He knew how to take down a lone man without killing him, and the fool should expect worse from the rest of the jungle.[PARAGRAPH:1]It was not a human, rushing out of the Bannor village. It was an orc; a half naked orc girl. It was his queen, he knew at once, as the dread he had been feeling for so long vanished.[PARAGRAPH:2]Braduk the Burning was as easy to find as ever, no matter how long he had been away. The unnatural fire showed the way, day or night. And now, for some reason, no blizzards obscured his sight. His journey had been fraught with the perils of winter, perils he had known all his life. The short trip from the outlying Bannor holdings to the sacred city of the orcs bore him no such hardships. The air was warm. No rain fell, let alone snow. He actually felt warm, even without his furs, which Sheelba now wrapped around herself.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The men were celebrating the end of winter," she told him. Rantine nodded. Conversation was foreign to him, and this girl had no end of words. She made liberal use of them as they neared the city, telling bits and pieces of her life. But she was stunned into silence when they entered Braduk. Hundreds of orcs were arrayed before the flames, preparing for war. Sharpening spears, applying war paint, carving shields, harnessing wargs-everywhere was a flurry of activity. Rantine noticed the orcs arrayed around the banners of their clans. The Reindeer, the Forked Spear, the Bear... even two companies of lizard men. But above them all flew the banner of Embers. And that meant one thing to Rantine.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jonas."[PARAGRAPH:1]"What?" Sheelba clutched tightly to his arm as they began to be noticed.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jonas Endain will be here. When I left, he vowed to kill me."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Why?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I was once a hero among our people. But I tried to stop the war, to lead a clan of orcs into treaties with men and against the savagery of Orthus."[PARAGRAPH:1]Sheelba stared at him, confused.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The men never intended to make peace. The elders were slaughtered. I was... thanked and released."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rantine looked away, unable to meet Sheelba's gaze, but before she could question him further, an enormous orc entered the village followed by a lizardman scouting party. An orc with a girl's head attached to the shaft of a thick mace.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hello Jonas. What's happening?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I have united the Clans, Rantine. We are marching on the humans. Going to revenge your folly. Bhall has chosen me to lead. Stay out of my way." The orcs' Priest-King pushed past Rantine.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Wait-you can't do that!" Jonas turned to give Sheelba a contemptuous glare. "Every time you attack the Bannor, you die! I've seen it from their side. They win because they have bronze, they have iron, they have magics, and they have training! Throwing away orc lives in mindless raids will get you... will get us nothing! We need civilization to defeat men on their terms!"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Who is she?" Jonas asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]"She is your queen. And I... I will be your protector, Jonas, if you heed her. Otherwise, our people are doomed. I have seen it."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rantine expected to die. Any other Clan might have listened. The Jonas he knew would not take such provocation.[PARAGRAPH:1]Jonas seethed. He gripped the mace tighter. Then, "Come, the two of you. We will speak of this alone."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LEADER_HAFGAN]Part 4: Bellowing Embers[\LINK]</Italian>

		<English>[H2]Chapter 1: Beltane Cycle[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]"We danced under the leaves, in the forest that was Sucellus. He sat at its heart but he was the branches that we walked upon, the ground on which we played and wind and rain that nurtured us. There was no disease, and no death that he did not allow."[PARAGRAPH:1]"That isn't to say that no one died. Our lives were long but not eternal and eventually the physical body would be laid aside to travel in more spiritual places. But no one ever died by malice or accident. A child jumping from branch to branch was blessed by Sucellus with agility and balance, but he would also find that the branch would move to catch him as well. So great was Sucellus's love for us that his forest cared for us as well."[PARAGRAPH:1]The elven children gathered closer to the storyteller. They could still feel the stirring of their bonds with the forest, but the forests they knew were tombs compared to the forest in the Age of Dragons. The elves still felt deep reverence for them, but the soul of the forest was gone.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What story would you like to hear tonight children?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Many answers were shouted back, the storyteller stopped them, surprised by one of the suggestions.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The Black Mirror? What do you know of that story Cewellyn?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The boy smiled shyly. "My father said that the Malakim receive visions from a sea of glass that is supposed to bless anyone who looks into it, to make him more virtuous. But that in hell there is one that does the opposite."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, there was once a mirror as your father described, but it has been destroyed now. Remember that during this first age, as we lived in Sucellus's embrace and the gentle Aifons dwelt in the Seas with Danalin, the rest of creation was at war. We were bordered by vast mountains with moving rocks, battle scarred plains and the sea. Of those only the sea was safe to travel on. Those few that left to explore other regions never returned."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Cernunnos was with us then as well, and had 3 mortal wives. They all bore him children and all the male children were born with the horns and hooves of their father. They were powerful fighters among the Ljosalfar and used to play games to test their strength. The greatest was said to be Gower."[PARAGRAPH:1]"They were powerful sons, but powerful only compared to those in the forest and the occasional Aifon traveler, and they believed themselves to be unbeatable. They spent days watching the great beasts of the gods battle across the plains neighboring the forest, envying the battle they couldn't join. Until the day Gower defied the laws of Sucellus and left the forest to see what lay on the other side of the mountains."[PARAGRAPH:2]The branches reached for the charging Satyr, roots and weeds wrapped around his hooves but still he charged ahead tearing plants from the ground. Back behind his brothers called for him and a rustle of warning spread through the forest towards its heart. But Gower charged on.[PARAGRAPH:1]Leaping from the forests edge onto the rocky slope of the mountains was like moving from one world to another. He was no longer within the borders of Sucellus's lands and he immediately felt the difference. The forest had loved him, nourished him and been a companion from birth. But he felt nothing from the rough stone beneath him now. Beside him the forest lay open, welcoming him back like a protective womb. But Gower pushed on.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the forest the wind whistled though the canopy of trees, but here it roared against the mountains. He imagined the breath of those great beasts he saw battling on the fields couldn't be much stronger than this and the higher he climbed the more the wind pushed and switched direction.[PARAGRAPH:1]Everything seemed dangerous here. In the forest he had been the strongest of his father's sons, and there was nothing that he couldn't bend, break or push aside. But here the stones chipped at his hooves and tore at his skin when he fell and slid back along the steep mountainside. Occasionally the mountain shook, sending rocks raining down on him. One of these rockslides caused a rock to cut deeply into his shoulder. He had bled before, in mock battles with his brothers they would often hurt each other. But where those wounds were the worst he could receive in the forests embrace, here it was the very least.[PARAGRAPH:1]Stopping halfway up he looked back to see he had long ago risen well past even the forests tallest trees. He could look down into the emerald lands of Sucellus and see the deep blue sea beyond. To the west the mountains continued and to the east the battle scarred plains where he had watched so many battles. Now he saw a floating citadel passing over the plains like a giant rocky spike. Fortifications and symbols were carved into the rock and winged creatures surrounded it like a black cloud. As it got closer to the mountain range great giants rose out of the ground and began tossing rocks at the floating citadel. Crashing into it and causing hordes of the flying creatures to swoop down, pick up the giants and carry them up almost to the citadel before dropping them.[PARAGRAPH:1]But the rocks did little damage to the citadel and the winged creatures were rarely able to lift one of the giants off of the ground. The battle continued for hours as Gower climbed, with little success from either side. Night came and eventually the sounds of rocks slamming into the citadel and the distant war cries from either side faded away as well. The moon hung low over the sea but the stars were obscured by a grey haze.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Gower reached the mountains peak he saw the source of the haze. Beyond the mountains burned. Great red rivers ran from them like blood and tortured smoke poured from peaks and collapsed holes in the mountains.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Such is the cost of war."[PARAGRAPH:1]An angel was sitting in the shadow of the peak. He was old, powerfully built and wore a gold crown decorated with opals.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What happened?" Gower asked, wary but curious about the stranger.[PARAGRAPH:1]"A raid on Kilmorph's lands. This was once a beautiful valley filled with the wide eyed Calculpech and troublesome groundhogs. Now only ash and broken rock remain."[PARAGRAPH:1]Gower noticed that the angel had a long spear beside him. It had rings on the end where a banner could be flown but the rings were empty.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Who are you?" Gower asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Once the champion of hope, but that time is long past. Now I am only another victim of this great war."[PARAGRAPH:1]At this the angel finally turned and considered Gower, and Gower felt uneasy in his stare. Unwilling to be read by the angel Gower offered his identity.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I am Gower, from the domain of Sucellus."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ahh, Gower. Do you come to join the war or to end it?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Gower considered the question. He only really wanted to see what was on the other side of the mountains, maybe wrestle the beasts he saw fighting on the plains. But this destruction, this kind of war, shocked him.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I thought I would fight, but I see now that Sucellus was right to stay out of the Godswar. There is too much pain here."[PARAGRAPH:1]The angel smiled, Gower thought he approved of his answer but in truth the angel was just amused by the satyr's innocence.[PARAGRAPH:1]"We can end this war, but not through diplomacy. Only through more pain. When creation itself shudders, when every angel fights, there will be no choice but peace."[PARAGRAPH:1]As the angel spoke he stood up and his gold wings unfurled. Gower had seen Sucellus as the heart of the forest many times and this angel shared a majestic quality with the god of nature.[PARAGRAPH:1]"That will never happen," Gower answered "Sucellus will never join the war."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, yes he will."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_2]Chapter 2: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_3]Chapter 3: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_4]Chapter 4: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_5]Chapter 5: Beltane Cycle[\LINK]</English>

Crashing into it and causing hordes of the flying creatures to swoop down, pick up the giants and carry them up almost to the citadel before dropping them.[PARAGRAPH:1]But the rocks did little damage to the citadel and the winged creatures were rarely able to lift one of the giants off of the ground. The battle continued for hours as Gower climbed, with little success from either side. Night came and eventually the sounds of rocks slamming into the citadel and the distant war cries from either side faded away as well. The moon hung low over the sea but the stars were obscured by a grey haze.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Gower reached the mountains peak he saw the source of the haze. Beyond the mountains burned. Great red rivers ran from them like blood and tortured smoke poured from peaks and collapsed holes in the mountains.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Such is the cost of war."[PARAGRAPH:1]An angel was sitting in the shadow of the peak. He was old, powerfully built and wore a gold crown decorated with opals.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What happened?" Gower asked, wary but curious about the stranger.[PARAGRAPH:1]"A raid on Kilmorph's lands. This was once a beautiful valley filled with the wide eyed Calculpech and troublesome groundhogs. Now only ash and broken rock remain."[PARAGRAPH:1]Gower noticed that the angel had a long spear beside him. It had rings on the end where a banner could be flown but the rings were empty.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Who are you?" Gower asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Once the champion of hope, but that time is long past. Now I am only another victim of this great war."[PARAGRAPH:1]At this the angel finally turned and considered Gower, and Gower felt uneasy in his stare. Unwilling to be read by the angel Gower offered his identity.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I am Gower, from the domain of Sucellus."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ahh, Gower. Do you come to join the war or to end it?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Gower considered the question. He only really wanted to see what was on the other side of the mountains, maybe wrestle the beasts he saw fighting on the plains. But this destruction, this kind of war, shocked him.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I thought I would fight, but I see now that Sucellus was right to stay out of the Godswar. There is too much pain here."[PARAGRAPH:1]The angel smiled, Gower thought he approved of his answer but in truth the angel was just amused by the satyr's innocence.[PARAGRAPH:1]"We can end this war, but not through diplomacy. Only through more pain. When creation itself shudders, when every angel fights, there will be no choice but peace."[PARAGRAPH:1]As the angel spoke he stood up and his gold wings unfurled. Gower had seen Sucellus as the heart of the forest many times and this angel shared a majestic quality with the god of nature.[PARAGRAPH:1]"That will never happen," Gower answered "Sucellus will never join the war."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, yes he will."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_2]Chapter 2: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_3]Chapter 3: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_4]Chapter 4: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_5]Chapter 5: Beltane Cycle[\LINK]</French>
		<German>[H2]Kapitel 1: Der Beltanezyklus[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]"Wir tanzten unter den Blättern, in dem Wald, den Sucellus verkörperte. Er saß im Herzen des Waldes, aber er verkörperte die Äste auf denen wir liefen, den Boden auf dem wir spielten und Wind und Regen die uns nährten. Es gab keine Krankheiten und keinen Tod, den er nicht erlaubte."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Es ist nicht so, dass niemand gestorben wäre. Unsere Leben waren lang, aber nicht ewig und manchmal wurde der materielle Körper abgestreift um an mehr spirituellen Orten zu wandeln. Aber keiner starb je durch Absicht oder Unfälle. Ein Kind, das von Ast zu Ast sprang, war von Sucellus mit Gewandheit und Balance gesegnet, aber es würde auch bemerken, dass sich der Ast manchmal bewegte um es aufzufangen. So groß war Sucellus' Liebe zu uns, dass sein Wald ebenfalls für uns sorgte."[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Elfenkinder scharten sich näher um den Geschichtenerzähler. Sie konnten noch immer das ergreifende Band mit dem Wald spüren, aber die Wälder die sie kannten waren eher Gräber im Vergleich zu den Wäldern des Zeitalters der Drachen. Die Elfen verspürten noch immer Ehrfurcht für sie, aber der Geist der Wälder war entschwunden.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Welche Geschichte möchtet ihr heute Nacht hören, Kinder?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Viele Antworten wurden ihm zugerufen, der Geschichtenerzähler hob beschwichtigend die Hand, erstaunt und überrascht durch eine der Antworten.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Der schwarze Spiegel? Was weißt du von dieser Geschichte, Cewellyn?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Junge lächelte scheu. "Mein Vater hat mir erzählt, dass die Malakim Visionen von einer See aus Glas erhalten, von der angenommen wird, dass sie jeden segnet, der in sie hinein blickt, und ihn tugendhafter werden lässt. Aber in der Hölle gibt es eine, die genau das Gegenteil macht."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ja, einst gab es einen Spiegel wie ihn dein Vater beschreibt, aber er ist heute zerstört. Bedenke, dass im ersten Zeitalter, als wir unter Sucellus' Schutz lebten und die sanften Aifons zusammen mit Danalin in den Meeren wohnten, der Rest der Schöpfung im Krieg lag. Wir waren von hohen Bergen mit sich bewegenden Felsen umgeben, von durch Kriege vernarbten Ebenen und der See. Und lediglich die See war sicher, um auf ihr zu reisen. Die wenigen, die auszogen um anderen Regionen zu erkunden, kehrten niemals zurück."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Cernunnos war ebenfalls bei uns und hatte 3 sterbliche Frauen. Sie alle gebaren ihm Kinder und die Jungen wurden mit den Hörnern und Hufen ihres Vaters geboren. Sie waren starke Kämpfer in den Reihen der Ljosalfar und spielten oft Spiele ihre Stärke zu testen. Der größte soll Gower gewesen sein."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sie waren mächtige Söhne, aber nur im Vergleich zu den anderen Bewohnern des Waldes und den ab und an durchreisenden Aifon; und sie hielten sich selbst für unbesiegbar. Sie verbrachten oft Tage damit, den großen Bestien der Götter zuzusehen, die sich auf den Ebenen neben dem Wald bekämpften, sie um den Kampf, an dem sie nicht teilnehmen konnten, beneidend. Bis zu dem Tag an dem Gower die Gesetze von Sucellus brach und den Wald verließ, um zu sehen was auf der anderen Seite der Berge liegen möge."[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Äste versuchten den ausbrechenden Satyr zu halten, Wurzeln und Gräser umfassten seine Hufe, aber er bewegte sich weiter vorwärts, Pflanzen aus dem Boden reißend. Hinter ihm riefen seine Brüder nach ihm und eine geraschelte Warnung lief durch den Wald bis in sein Herz. Aber Gower ging weiter.[PARAGRAPH:1]Aus dem Wald herauszuspingen und auf den felsigen Hängen der Berge zu landen, war wie eine Reise von einer Welt in eine andere. Er befand sich nicht länger in den Grenzen Sucellus' Länder und er spürte sofort den Unterschied. Der Wald hatte ihn geliebt und ernährt und war ein Gefährte gewesen, seid seiner Geburt. Aber er spürte absolut nichts von den rauen Steinen unter ihm. Neben ihm lag der Wald, offen, ihn willkommen zurück heißend, wie eine beschützende Mutter. Aber Gower trieb es weiter vorwärts.[PARAGRAPH:1]Im Wald war der Wind durch das Blätterdach gerauscht, aber hier toste er gegen die Felswände. Er stellte sich vor, dass der Atem der großen Bestien, die er sich gegenseitig auf den Ebenen bekämpfen sah, nicht viel stärker als dies hier sein könne. Und je höher er kletterte, desto stärker blies der Wind und wechselte häufiger seine Richtung.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alles hier sah gefährlich aus. Im Wald war er der stärkste der Söhne seines Vaters gewesen, und es hatte nichts gegeben, was er nicht verbiegen, brechen oder zur Seite bewegen konnte. Aber hier schälten die Steine seine Hufe ab und ritzten seine Haut wenn er fiel und die steilen Hänge zurückrutschte. Gelegentlich bewegte sich der Berg und sandte Felsen hinab, die auf ihn herabregneten. Einer dieser Bergrutsche ließ einen Stein seine Schulter tief verwunden. Er hatte schon früher geblutet, in den Scheinkämpfen mit seinen Brüdern hatten sie sich oft gegenseitig verletzt. Aber diese Wunden waren die schwersten gewesen, die er unter dem Schutz des Waldes hatte erleiden können, so waren es jetzt die leichtesten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Auf halber Höhe hielt er inne, sah zurück und bemerkte, dass er schon einiges höher war, als die größten Bäume des Waldes. Er konnte zu den smaragdgrünen Ländern Sucellus' zurückblicken und sah sogar die tiefblaue See dahinter. Im Westen setzen sich die Berge fort und im Osten lagen die kriegsgezeichneten Ebenen, auf denen er schon so manche Schlacht beobachtet hatte. Nun sah er eine schwebende Zitadelle, die sich über die Ebenen bewegte, wie ein großer felsiger Stachel. Befestigungen und Symbole waren in den Fels geschlagen und geflügelte Kreaturen umgaben sie wie eine schwarze Wolke. Als sie den Bergen näher kam erhoben sich große Giganten aus dem Boden und begannen Felsen auf die Zitadelle zu schleudern. Sie krachten in die Zitadelle und ließen Horden der fliegenden Wesen nach unten stoßen, die Giganten hochheben und sie fast bis zur Zitadelle hochfliegen, bevor sie sie wieder fallen ließen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Aber die Felsen verursachten nur wenig Schaden an der Zitadelle und die Geflügelten waren kaum in der Lage einen der Giganten in die Lüfte zu erheben. Die Schlachte wogte für Stunden hin und her während Gower weiterkletterte, ohne das eine Seite einen Vorteil erreichen konnte. Die Nacht fiel und schließlich verhallten die Geräusche der einschlagenden Felsbrocken und auch die Kriegsschreie beider Seiten verstummte zunehmend. Der Mond stand tief über dem Meer, aber die Sterne wurden durch grauen Rauch verdeckt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Als Gower die Bergspitze erreichte sah er die Quelle des Rauches. Die Berge brannten! Große rote Flüsse strömten wie Blut die Hänge hinab, Rauch und Qualm stieg von den Spitzen auf und eingestürzte Krater befanden sich im Fels.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Das ist der Preis des Krieges."[PARAGRAPH:1]Ein Engel saß im Schatten der Bergspitze. Er war alt, kräftig gebaut und trug eine goldenen, mit Opalen verzierte Krone.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Was ist geschehen?" fragte Gower, wachsam aber auch neugierig wegen des Fremden.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ein Überfall auf Kilmorphs Länder. Einst war dies ein schönes Tal, bevölkert von den großäugigen Calculpech und den lästigen Murmeltieren. Nun gibt es nur noch Asche und Felstrümmer."[PARAGRAPH:1]Gower bemerkte, dass der Engel einen langen Speer neben sich am Fels lehnen hatte. Er hatte Ringe unter der Spitze, sodass eine Flagge befestigt werden könnte, aber die Ringe waren leer.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Wer seid Ihr?" fragte Gower.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Einst ein Champion der Hoffnung, aber diese Zeit ist lange vorbei. Nun bin ich lediglich ein weiteres Opfer dieses Krieges."[PARAGRAPH:1]Dabei drehte sich der Engel um und musterte Gower und Gower fühlte sich unwohl unter dessen Blick. Unwillig von dem Engel gelesen zu werden wie ein Buch offenbarte Gower seine Identität.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich bin Gower, aus den Ländern Sucellus'."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ahh, Gower. Seid Ihr gekommen dem Krieg beizutreten oder ihn zu beenden?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Gower überdachte die Frage. Er wollte ja nur gesehen haben, was auf der anderen Seite der Berge liegt, und eventuell mit den Bestien ringen, die er in der Ebene gesehen hatte. Aber diese Zerstörung, diese Art des Krieges, schockierte ihn zutiefst.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich denke ich würde kämpfen, aber ich sehe nun, dass Sucellus Recht damit hatte, sich aus dem Götterkrieg herauszuhalten. Es gibt einfach zu viel Leid."[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Engel lächelte, Gower dachte, dass er seiner Antwort zustimmen würde, aber in Wirklichkeit war Engel nur von der Unschuld des Satyrs amüsiert.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Wir können diesen Krieg beenden, aber nicht durch Diplomatie. Nur durch noch mehr Leid. Wenn die Schöpfung selbst erschaudert, wenn jeder Engel kämpft, dann wird es keine andere Wahl mehr geben als den Frieden."[PARAGRAPH:1]Als der Engel sprach erhob er sich und entfaltete seine goldenen Flügel. Gower hatte Sucellus schon oft im Herzen des Waldes gesehen und dieser Engel teilte eine majestätische Erhabenheit mit dem Gott der Natur.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Das wird niemals geschehen," antwortete Gower, "Sucellus wird niemals am Krieg teilnehmen."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Doch, doch, wer wird."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_2]Kapitel 2: Der Beltanezyklus[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_3]Kapitel 3: Der Beltanezyklus[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_4]Kapitel 4: Der Beltanezyklus[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_5]Kapitel 5: Der Beltanezyklus[\LINK]</German>
		<Italian>[H2]Chapter 1: Beltane Cycle[\H2][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]"We danced under the leaves, in the forest that was Sucellus. He sat at its heart but he was the branches that we walked upon, the ground on which we played and wind and rain that nurtured us. There was no disease, and no death that he did not allow."[PARAGRAPH:1]"That isn't to say that no one died. Our lives were long but not eternal and eventually the physical body would be laid aside to travel in more spiritual places. But no one ever died by malice or accident. A child jumping from branch to branch was blessed by Sucellus with agility and balance, but he would also find that the branch would move to catch him as well. So great was Sucellus's love for us that his forest cared for us as well."[PARAGRAPH:1]The elven children gathered closer to the storyteller. They could still feel the stirring of their bonds with the forest, but the forests they knew were tombs compared to the forest in the Age of Dragons. The elves still felt deep reverence for them, but the soul of the forest was gone.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What story would you like to hear tonight children?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Many answers were shouted back, the storyteller stopped them, surprised by one of the suggestions.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The Black Mirror? What do you know of that story Cewellyn?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The boy smiled shyly. "My father said that the Malakim receive visions from a sea of glass that is supposed to bless anyone who looks into it, to make him more virtuous. But that in hell there is one that does the opposite."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, there was once a mirror as your father described, but it has been destroyed now. Remember that during this first age, as we lived in Sucellus's embrace and the gentle Aifons dwelt in the Seas with Danalin, the rest of creation was at war. We were bordered by vast mountains with moving rocks, battle scarred plains and the sea. Of those only the sea was safe to travel on. Those few that left to explore other regions never returned."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Cernunnos was with us then as well, and had 3 mortal wives. They all bore him children and all the male children were born with the horns and hooves of their father. They were powerful fighters among the Ljosalfar and used to play games to test their strength. The greatest was said to be Gower."[PARAGRAPH:1]"They were powerful sons, but powerful only compared to those in the forest and the occasional Aifon traveler, and they believed themselves to be unbeatable. They spent days watching the great beasts of the gods battle across the plains neighboring the forest, envying the battle they couldn't join. Until the day Gower defied the laws of Sucellus and left the forest to see what lay on the other side of the mountains."[PARAGRAPH:2]The branches reached for the charging Satyr, roots and weeds wrapped around his hooves but still he charged ahead tearing plants from the ground. Back behind his brothers called for him and a rustle of warning spread through the forest towards its heart. But Gower charged on.[PARAGRAPH:1]Leaping from the forests edge onto the rocky slope of the mountains was like moving from one world to another. He was no longer within the borders of Sucellus's lands and he immediately felt the difference. The forest had loved him, nourished him and been a companion from birth. But he felt nothing from the rough stone beneath him now. Beside him the forest lay open, welcoming him back like a protective womb. But Gower pushed on.[PARAGRAPH:1]In the forest the wind whistled though the canopy of trees, but here it roared against the mountains. He imagined the breath of those great beasts he saw battling on the fields couldn't be much stronger than this and the higher he climbed the more the wind pushed and switched direction.[PARAGRAPH:1]Everything seemed dangerous here. In the forest he had been the strongest of his father's sons, and there was nothing that he couldn't bend, break or push aside. But here the stones chipped at his hooves and tore at his skin when he fell and slid back along the steep mountainside. Occasionally the mountain shook, sending rocks raining down on him. One of these rockslides caused a rock to cut deeply into his shoulder. He had bled before, in mock battles with his brothers they would often hurt each other. But where those wounds were the worst he could receive in the forests embrace, here it was the very least.[PARAGRAPH:1]Stopping halfway up he looked back to see he had long ago risen well past even the forests tallest trees. He could look down into the emerald lands of Sucellus and see the deep blue sea beyond. To the west the mountains continued and to the east the battle scarred plains where he had watched so many battles. Now he saw a floating citadel passing over the plains like a giant rocky spike. Fortifications and symbols were carved into the rock and winged creatures surrounded it like a black cloud. As it got closer to the mountain range great giants rose out of the ground and began tossing rocks at the floating citadel. Crashing into it and causing hordes of the flying creatures to swoop down, pick up the giants and carry them up almost to the citadel before dropping them.[PARAGRAPH:1]But the rocks did little damage to the citadel and the winged creatures were rarely able to lift one of the giants off of the ground. The battle continued for hours as Gower climbed, with little success from either side. Night came and eventually the sounds of rocks slamming into the citadel and the distant war cries from either side faded away as well. The moon hung low over the sea but the stars were obscured by a grey haze.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Gower reached the mountains peak he saw the source of the haze. Beyond the mountains burned. Great red rivers ran from them like blood and tortured smoke poured from peaks and collapsed holes in the mountains.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Such is the cost of war."[PARAGRAPH:1]An angel was sitting in the shadow of the peak. He was old, powerfully built and wore a gold crown decorated with opals.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What happened?" Gower asked, wary but curious about the stranger.[PARAGRAPH:1]"A raid on Kilmorph's lands. This was once a beautiful valley filled with the wide eyed Calculpech and troublesome groundhogs. Now only ash and broken rock remain."[PARAGRAPH:1]Gower noticed that the angel had a long spear beside him. It had rings on the end where a banner could be flown but the rings were empty.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Who are you?" Gower asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Once the champion of hope, but that time is long past. Now I am only another victim of this great war."[PARAGRAPH:1]At this the angel finally turned and considered Gower, and Gower felt uneasy in his stare.

They spoke of his son Gower, that he had left the protection of the forest. He was instantly up and charging through the forest. The Ljosalfar stared as his passing, unable to hear the trees and scared to see the greatest angel of Sucellus so enraged.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Where did he go? What of my children?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The chorus of answers surrounded him, "into the mountains...", "the children wait at the forests edge...", "Gower is gone...".[PARAGRAPH:1]As he ran he felt the presence of Sucellus beside him, calming him although Cernunnos didn't want to be calmed.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Why didn't you stop him?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Sucellus spoke directly to his archangel, his words resounded within him "This is no prison my child. Gower left of his own will, you cannot follow."[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos knew the truth of the words but refused to answer. In a few minutes he was at the forests edge where the rest of sons stood yelling for Gower to come back. Gower was just beginning the ascent, no more than a few hundred yards from the forests edge. Cernunnos stopped to command his other sons to return to the forests heart, but so terrible was his expression that he didn't even need to speak to send them all fleeing into the forest.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos yelled from the edge. His great voice echoed against the mountain and everyone in the forest heard his call but Gower continued on as if he hadn't. Frustrated Cernunnos ripped out a tree and slammed it into the ground. The mountainside trembled with the blow, sending rocks rolling down into the forest and even knocking down Gower as he climbed. But still he didn't look back.[PARAGRAPH:1]Even more angry Cernunnos picked up one of the loose rocks that had rolled into the forest and threw it at his son. The rock hit Gower on his shoulder and he fell in pain. But when he picked himself up he only looked up the mountain and hurried forward even faster.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos looked back into the forests heart. Sucellus hadn't moved from the great chamber of root and branches that was his home, but his spirit was there at the forests edge. Cernunnos only whispered "I'm sorry" and then jumped out onto the mountainside.[PARAGRAPH:1]Landing on the rocky slope Cernunnos felt the loss of Sucellus's ara for the first time. His body trembled and it felt like his soul was pulled out of him. Only the thought of his eldest son scrambling up the slope ahead of him allowed him to continue on. Cernunnos yelled Gower's name again as he picked himself up.[PARAGRAPH:1]A shadow fell over him. Cernunnos recognized the god of despair when he saw him and paled when Agares dropped between him and his son.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You were always my favorite of the archangels, are you as strong as they say?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares stood bathed in black and gold flames, he was beautiful and horrible. His lance was raised above his head and his 6 wings fully unfurled and blocking Cernunnos's sight of his son.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos summoned the strength to talk, "I only want my son, I have no quarrel with you."[PARAGRAPH:1]"If you want him," Agares smiled "come and get him."[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos charged forward, lowering his head he braced his shoulders for the impact. Nothing had ever resisted his charge, though he had never attacked a god before.[PARAGRAPH:1]Just before the strike a single feather fell off of Agares's wing. It landed on Cernunnos's back and drove the charging archangel to the ground. There he lay prostrate before the god of entropy, a single feather on his back. As much as he struggled, dug his hands into the earth and shattered the rocks beneath him Cernunnos could not rise.[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares knelt down beside Cernunnos, "Maybe next time will work out better for you." Then Agares was off into the sky, the shadow passed over Cernunnos and was gone.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos labored under the weight of the feather for the rest of the day. When the sun finally dipped below the mountains and Cernunnos was swallowed by the mountains shadow a breeze blew along the mountainside. Barely enough to ruffle hair the breeze picked up the feather which circled lazily in the breeze before slipping down and coming to rest at the forests edge.[PARAGRAPH:1]But Cernunnos was already gone. The mountain shook with each thunderous strike of his hooves as he charged up the mountain. He could see the silhouette of Gower at the mountains peak, standing, looking over the mountain. Cernunnos was terrified for his son but for a moment he had hope. Hope that he would reach him in time. Hope that his encounter with Agares had nothing to do with Gower. Then Agares stood up next to Gower on the mountains peak and that hope was gone.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos screamed, the mountains echoed that terrified yell back at him and over the forest below. The Ljosalfar cried in anguish and Cernunnos's other children echoed their fathers yell.[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares reached out and grabbed Gower by the throat. The satyr flailed helplessly in the gods powerful grip. Gower's muscles strained and turned red, his limbs trembled. Agares reached out with his other hand and opened a portal. There was a dark world beyond, full of ashes and pitch black seas. It was the ruins of a world now ground to dust. And Agares carried Gower through the portal.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos reached the top just as the portal began to close. Without thinking he leapt through.[PARAGRAPH:2]Cernunnos lost his connection with Sucellus when he left the forest. But he hadn't realized that he could feel the connection with each of the gods until it was taken from him. Passionate Bhall, loving Sirona, vigilant Junil all had some part in his soul and drove him from the forest to save his son. But this world was devoid of their voices. Here only one god remained, the god of despair, Agares.[PARAGRAPH:1]The world was ash in all directions. The sky was empty and although he had seen a dark river leading to a sea that seemed to reflect the empty sky Cernunnos couldn't see it now. But Cernunnos was not without talents, he was the archangel of nature and he reached his hands down into the grey earth and called for some living thing to respond. Something with strength, with warmth that could grow and change. The entire world could not be dead.[PARAGRAPH:1]And he felt it, the only life in this forgotten world, his son being dragged into a pit. Gower was still alive but in horrible pain. And for the first time Gower sensed Cernunnos as well and called out his father's name.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos was up and moving again. Across the endless grey, his breaths the only sound in this empty world and a wake of ashes left behind him. He followed his sons call until he came to a great pit. In the center a granite island floated and ashes eternally fell like sand from it into the darkness below. Agares stood on the island with the captured Gower.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos leapt. He flew across the expanse like a bird in flight and as he flew he heard, he felt, Gower's cries. Halfway across the expanse Agares squeezed the neck of the young satyr and he died. Gower's soul hung in the air, longed for the call of Sucellus to lead him to his eternal home but Agares reached out and consumed the satyr's soul instead.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos slammed into the side of the floating island. He cried out for his son in despair as he clawed his way up and over the lip of the island onto the top.[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares stood alone on the flat granite top. He casually tossed the broken body of Gower down in front of him and Cernunnos charged. Agares held out a hand to stop the enraged archangel and the entire world shuddered with the force of the impact. Agares was the heart of this world and he could not be moved. But so powerful was Cernunnos strike that the world was moved around him. Chasms opened up in the surface of the deepest hell, rivers poured into lost caverns, and Agares was laid prostrate before the mighty Cernunnos.[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares looked down at the horn marks in his black and gold breastplate. It was as great a hit as the he had ever received, but he was a god and would not fall to an archangels attack.[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares was on Cernunnos in full force. His lance forgotten Agares tore into the horned giant as a beast. Black and gold flames sheathed both of them, burning Cernunnos and he suffered through the physical attack and a similar assault on his soul. Both his body and his spirit were being crushed by the force of Agares. Agares grabbed Cernunnos's head and turned it to the smooth polished floor of the island, it was a perfect black mirror that reflected the pain and anguish Cernunnos was feeling.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You were always my favorite of the archangels." Agares whispered.[PARAGRAPH:1]From within the black mirror Cernunnos's image writhed and yelled. He shared all of Cernunnos's features but they were cast in blacks and reds instead of browns and green of the archangel. As Cernunnos watched in horror the image reached up through the surface and climbed out of the mirror. This dark version of him stood leering down at where Agares held him.[PARAGRAPH:1]Satisfied with his new creation Agares wrapped his hand around Cernunnos's throat and squeezed. The world swirled in Cernunnos's gaze, he could feel his life draining from him and Agares preparing to consume his soul.[PARAGRAPH:1]A crack of thunder shook the island. Agares screamed in pain and dropped Cernunnos. Another blow destroyed Agares's breastplate and drove the god back further. The twisted image of Cernunnos charged and was caught by deer hooves and kicked over the side of the island and into the pit. Sucellus stood in the center of the island, an angry god in all his glory. He looked down at Cernunnos but his gaze was caught in the black mirror.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos realized immediately what was happening so he struck the mirror with all his force and the mirror exploded around them. Great black shards rained over them and Agares howled in anger. Cernunnos picked up a shard, intending to throw it at the god of despair but Sucellus grabbed him and the grey wastes of Agares's hell disappeared beneath them.[PARAGRAPH:1]Back in the forest Sucellus called out to every plant and animal, ordering them to prepare for the coming battle. As his presence raced through the forest he could already feel Agares's taint invading. The forest was being twisted and corrupted. The grass withered, animals grew sick and fled, spreading their disease in any area they passed through.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos began organizing the Ljosalfar. They had never known war but they would soon. One, a young sculptor, looked into the shard of the black mirror Cernunnos still held. She was frozen, transfixed by it. A ghostly image appeared beside her, an image of her but malicious and cruel. Cernunnos crushed the image with his massive fist and handed the shard, face down, to the elf.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hide this, don't ever let anyone look into it."[PARAGRAPH:1]She took the shard it and rushed off immediately to perform the task. There was a battle coming, but Cernunnos had a task left to perform before he started it.[PARAGRAPH:1]He returned to his home beneath the red oak. Gower's mother was waiting outside. He didn't need to say anything, as he approached she fell weeping, her head in her hands.[PARAGRAPH:2]The children sat entranced by the story. Eyes widened with every attack and they quivered and mourned with each defeat.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What happened next?" Cewellyn asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]The storyteller considered the question.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I wish I could say that things were better but things became much worse. Sucellus and Danalin joined the Godswar and creation itself was nearly destroyed in the following weeks. Fortunately, rather than cause that, the gods came together to create the compact and agree to withdrawal from creation. All because of the events begun by Gower."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Did Sucellus rescue Gower?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, I don't believe so. But at Beltane the nations that revere Cernunnos hold a wrestling celebration that is in honor of his favored son. And to this day the satyrs, distant children of Cernunnos, ally themselves to any nation that follows their great father."[PARAGRAPH:1]The storyteller paused. Beltane was only a few nights away and he wanted the children to understand that these were more than just games.[PARAGRAPH:1]"But it is late and more of this story will have to wait for another night."[PARAGRAPH:1]The storyteller smiled as the children moaned and begged for a little more time. But they eventually accepted the storytellers statement and went off to their beds where they were met by dreams of battling gods, Cernunnos and his favorite son.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_3]Chapter 3: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_4]Chapter 4: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_5]Chapter 5: Beltane Cycle[\LINK]</English>
		<French>[LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_1]Chapter 1: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE]Chapter 2: Beltane Cycle[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cernunnos, the great horned one, awoke to the whispers of the trees. They spoke of his son Gower, that he had left the protection of the forest. He was instantly up and charging through the forest. The Ljosalfar stared as his passing, unable to hear the trees and scared to see the greatest angel of Sucellus so enraged.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Where did he go? What of my children?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The chorus of answers surrounded him, "into the mountains...", "the children wait at the forests edge...", "Gower is gone...".[PARAGRAPH:1]As he ran he felt the presence of Sucellus beside him, calming him although Cernunnos didn't want to be calmed.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Why didn't you stop him?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Sucellus spoke directly to his archangel, his words resounded within him "This is no prison my child. Gower left of his own will, you cannot follow."[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos knew the truth of the words but refused to answer. In a few minutes he was at the forests edge where the rest of sons stood yelling for Gower to come back. Gower was just beginning the ascent, no more than a few hundred yards from the forests edge. Cernunnos stopped to command his other sons to return to the forests heart, but so terrible was his expression that he didn't even need to speak to send them all fleeing into the forest.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos yelled from the edge. His great voice echoed against the mountain and everyone in the forest heard his call but Gower continued on as if he hadn't. Frustrated Cernunnos ripped out a tree and slammed it into the ground. The mountainside trembled with the blow, sending rocks rolling down into the forest and even knocking down Gower as he climbed. But still he didn't look back.[PARAGRAPH:1]Even more angry Cernunnos picked up one of the loose rocks that had rolled into the forest and threw it at his son. The rock hit Gower on his shoulder and he fell in pain. But when he picked himself up he only looked up the mountain and hurried forward even faster.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos looked back into the forests heart. Sucellus hadn't moved from the great chamber of root and branches that was his home, but his spirit was there at the forests edge. Cernunnos only whispered "I'm sorry" and then jumped out onto the mountainside.[PARAGRAPH:1]Landing on the rocky slope Cernunnos felt the loss of Sucellus's ara for the first time. His body trembled and it felt like his soul was pulled out of him. Only the thought of his eldest son scrambling up the slope ahead of him allowed him to continue on. Cernunnos yelled Gower's name again as he picked himself up.[PARAGRAPH:1]A shadow fell over him.

		<German>[LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_1]Kapitel 1: Der Beltanezyklus[\LINK][NEWLINE]Kapitel 2: Der Beltanezyklus[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Cernunnos, der große Geweih Tragende, erwachte auf das Flüstern der Bäume hin. Sie sprachen über seinen Sohn Gower, dem er den Schutz des Waldes übertragen hatte. Er war sofort hellwach und rannte durch den Wald. Die Ljosalfar starrten ihn an während er an ihnen vorbeirauschte, unfähig die Bäume zu hören und erschrocken durch die Tatsache, dass der größte von Sucellus' Engeln so in Aufruhr war.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Wo ist er hingegangen? Was ist mit meinen Kindern?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Chor der Antworten umfing ihn, "in die Berge...", "die Kinder warten am Waldesrand...", "Gower ist fort...".[PARAGRAPH:1]Während er rannte fühlte er Sucellus' Präsenz neben sich, ihn beruhigend obwohl Cernunnos nicht beruhigt werden wollte.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Warum hast du ihn nicht aufgehalten?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Sucellus sprach direkt zu seinem Erzengel, seine Worte hallten in ihm wieder "Dies ist kein Gefängnis, mein Kind. Gower ging aus freien Stücken, du kannst ihm nicht folgen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos erkannte die Wahrheit in den Worten, aber wollte nicht antworten. Nach wenigen Minuten erreichte er den Rand des Waldes, wo seine anderen Söhne standen und Gower hinterherriefen zurückzukommen. Gower war gerade dabei den Aufstieg anzugehen, nicht mehr als ein paar hundert Meter vom Waldesrand entfernt. Cernunnos hielt an um seinen anderen Söhnen zu Befehlen in das Herz des Waldes zurückzukehren, aber sein Gesichtsausdruck war so schrecklich, dass er nicht zu sprechen brauchte um sie alle die Flucht zurück in den Wald ergreifen zu lassen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos brüllte vom Rand aus. Seine gewaltige Stimme echote von den Bergen zurück und jeder im Wald hörte seinen Ruf, aber Gower fuhr mit seinem AUfstieg fort als hätte er nichts gehört. Frustriert riss Cernunnos Baum aus und rammte ihn in den Boden. Die Bergwände erzitterten unter diesem Hieb, ließen Felsbrocken die Hänge hinab in den Wald rollen und warfen sogar Gower zu Boden während er kletterte. Aber er blickte noch immer nicht zurück.[PARAGRAPH:1]Noch wütender als zuvor packte Cernunnos einen der lose herumliegenden Felsbrocken und warf ihn nach seinem Sohn. Der Brocken traf Gower an seiner Schulter und er fiel vor Schmerzen um. Aber als er wieder aufstand blickte er lediglich den Berg hinauf und kletterte noch eiliger als zuvor.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos blickte zurück in das Herz des Waldes. Sucellus hatte sich nicht aus der großen Höhle aus Wurzeln und Ästen, die sein Zuhause war, herausbegeben, aber sein Geist stand hier am Rand des Waldes. Cernunnos flüsterte nur "Es tut mir Leid." und sprang dann zum Berghang.[PARAGRAPH:1]Als er am Hang landete fühlte Cernunnos das erste mal den Verlust von Sucellus' Aura. Sein Kröper erzitterte und es fühlte sich an, als ob seine Seele aus ihm herausgerissen worden wäre. Lediglich der Gedanke an seinen ältesten Sohn, wie er den Hang vor ihm hinaufkletterte, erlaubte ihm weiterzugehen. Cernunnos rief Gowers Namen erneut, als er sich selber aufmachte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ein Schatten fiel über ihn. Cernunnos erkannte den Gott der Verzweiflung als er ihn sah und erblasste als Agares zwischen ihm und seinem Sohn landete.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ihr wart schon immer mein Favorit unter den Erzengeln, seid Ihr wirklich so stark wie man sich erzählt?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares stand dort, gehüllt in schwarze und goldene Flammen, er war schön und schrecklich zugleich. Seine Lanze war über seinen Kopf erhoben und seine 6 Flügel voll entfaltet, Cernunnos Sicht auf seinen Sohn behindernd.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos beschwor seine Stärke um zu sprechen, "Ich will lediglich meinen Sohn, I habe keinen Streit mit Euch."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Wenn Ihr ihn wollt," lächelte Agares, "kommt und holt ihn."[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos stürmte vor, senkte seinen Kopf und spannte seinen Schultern an während er den Zusammenprall erwartete. Nichts hatte je seinem Ansturm standgehalten, allerdings hatte er auch niemals zuvor einen Gott angegriffen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kurz vor dem Aufprall fiel eine einzelne Feder aus Agares Flügeln. Sie landete auf Cernunnos' Rücken und sandte den angreifenden Erzengel zu Boden. Da lag er ausgestreckt vor den Füßen des Gottes der Entropie, eine einzelne Feder auf seinem Rücken. So sehr er sich auch anstrengte, seine Hände in die Erde rammte und die Felsen in seiner Nähe erschütterte, Cernunnos konnte sich nicht erheben.[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares kniete neben Cernunnos nieder, "Vielleicht läuft es das nächste Mal besser für Euch." Dann erhob sich Agares in den Himmel, sein Schatten flog über Cernunnos und er war entschwunden.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos kämpfte den Rest des Tages gegen das Gewicht der Feder an. Als die Sonne schließlich hinter den Bergen versank und Cernunnos von den Schatten der Berge eingehüllt wurde, kam eine leichte Brise auf. Kaum stark genug um Haare zu zerzausen nahm der Lufthauch die Feder auf, die träge durch die Luft taumelte und schlussendlich am Waldesrand zu liegen kam.[PARAGRAPH:1]Aber Cernunnos war da schon gegangen. Der Berg erzitterte mit jedem donnerden Hufschlag als er den Hang hinaufstürmte. Er konnte Gowers Umrisse oben auf der Spitze des Berges erkennen, stehend, über den Berg hinüberblickend. Cernunnos war regelrecht in Panik um seinen Sohn, aber für einen Moment hatte er Hoffnung. Hoffnung, dass er ihn rechtzeitig erreichen würde. Hoffnung, dass seine Begegnung mit Agares nicht mit Gower zu tun hätte. Dann erhob sich Agares direkt neben Gower und diese Hoffnung war verloren.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos schrie, die Berge warfen das Echo dieses Panikschreis zu ihm zurück und über den ganzen Wald hinter ihm. Die Ljosalfar schrien in Angst auf und Cernunnos andere Kinder stimmten in den Schrei ihres Vaters ein.[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares ergriff Gower mit einer Hand an seiner Kehle. Der Satyr zappelte hilflos im starken Griff des Gottes. Gowers Muskeln spannten sich an und wurden rot, seine Beine zitterten. Agares öffnete mit seiner anderen Hand ein Portal. Es lag eine dunkle Welt auf der anderen Seite, voller Asche und tiefschwarzer Seen. Es waren Überreste einer Welt, die in den Staub ihrer selbst gefallen war. Und Agares schleppte Gower durch das Portal.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos erreichte die Bergspitze gerade, als sich das Portal zu schließen anfing. Ohne nachzudenken eilte er hindurch.[PARAGRAPH:2]Cernunnos verlor seine Verbindung mit Sucellus als er den Wald verließ. Aber er hatte nie wahrgenommen, dass er die Verbindung mit jedem Gott fühlen konnte, bis sie ihm genommen wurde. Die leidenschaftliche Bhall, die liebende Sirona, der wachsame Junil, sie alle hatten einen Platz in seiner Seele und hatten ihn aus dem Wald getrieben, seinen Sohn zu retten. Aber diese Welt war ohne ihre Stimmen. Hier gab es nur noch einen Gott, den Gott der Verzweiflung, Agares.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Welt bestand aus Asche, wohin man auch sah. Der Himmel war leer und obwohl er einen dunklen Fluss gesehen hatte, der zu einem Meer zu führen schien, das den leeren Himmel reflektierte, sah Cernunnos nun nichts mehr von ihm. Aber Cernunnos war nicht ohne gewisse Talente, er war der Erzengel der Natur und er steckte seine Hände in die graue Erde und rief nach irgendeinem lebenden Ding um Antwort. Irgendetwas mit Stärke, mit Wärme, das wachsen und sich verändern könnte. Es könnte nicht die ganze Welt tot sein.[PARAGRAPH:1]Und er fühlte es, das einzige Leben in dieser vergessenen Welt war sein Sohn, der in eine Grube geworfen worden war. Gower war noch am Leben, aber litt unbeschreibliche Schmerzen. Und zum ersten Mal nahm Gower Cernunnos wahr und rief seines Vaters Namen aus.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos stand auf und bewegte sich vorwärts. Durch endloses Grau, sein Atem der einzige Ton in dieser leeren Welt und Wirbel aus Asche hinter ihm. Er folgte dem Ruf seines Sohnes, bis er zu einer großen Grube kam. In der Mitte schwebte eine Insel aus Granit und Asche fiel seit Ewigkeiten von ihrem Rand in die Dunkelheit unter ihr. Agares stand auf Insel, zusammen mit dem entführten Gower.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos sprang. Er glitt über den Zwischenraum wie ein Vogel im Flug und währenddessen hörte er, fühlte er, Gowers Schreie. Als er schon halb über den Abgrund war, brach Agares das Genick des jungen Satyrs und er starb. Gowers Seele hing in der Luft, wartete auf Sucellus Ruf, ihn zu seinem ewigen Heim zu geleiten, aber stattdessen griff Agares nach der Seele des Satyrs und verschlang sie.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos landete heftig auf dem Rand der schwebenden Insel. Er schrie voller Verzweiflung nach seinem Sohn, während er sich seinen Weg den Rand der Insel hoch und auf die Spitze bahnte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares stand alleine auf dem flachen Plateau der Granitinsel. Er warf den gebrochenen Körper Gowers beiläufig vor sich hin und Cernunnos griff an. Agares streckte eine Hand aus um den wütenden Erzengel zu stoppen und die ganze Welt erzitterte unter der Wucht des Aufpralls. Agares war das Herz dieser Welt und er konnte nicht bewegt werden. Aber Cernunnos Angriff war so stark, das die Welt um Agares herum bewegt wurde. Erdspalten aus der tiefsten Hölle öffneten sich an der Oberfläche, Flüsse schossen in leere Kavernen und Agares lag ausgestreckt vor dem mächtigen Cernunnos auf dem Boden.[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares sah hinab zu den Hornabdrücken in seiner schwarz-goldenen Brustplatte. Es war der stärkste Schlag der ihm jemals verpasst worden war, aber er war ein Gott und würde nicht unter dem Angriff eines Erzengels fallen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares ging Cernunnos mit all seiner Kraft an. Seine Lanze vergessend, warf sich Agares auf Cernunnos wie eine Bestie. Schwarze und goldene Flammen umhüllten sie beide, verbrannten Cernunnos und er litt sowohl unter dem körperlichen Angriff, als auch unter einem ähnlichen Angriff auf seine Seele. Sein Körper und sein Geist wurden von Agares' Macht zerschlagen. Agares ergriff Cernunnos Kopf und drehte ihn zu der polierten Oberfläche der Insel. Sie war ein perfekt schwarzer Spiegel, der die Schmerzen und Qualen, die Cernunnos fühlte, wiedergab.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ihr wart schon immer mein Favorit unter den Erzengeln." flüsterte Agares.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos' Spiegelbild wand sich und schrie. Es teilte alle von Cernunnos' Eigenschaften, aber sie waren in Schwarz und Rot gehalten, statt in Braun und Grün wie beim Erzengel. Noch während Cernunnos mit Entsetzen zusah, griff das Spiegelbild aus der Oberfläche heraus und kletterte aus dem Spiegel. Diese dunkle Version seiner selbst stand vor ihm und grinste ihn an.[PARAGRAPH:1]Zufrieden mit seiner neuen Schöpfung legte Agares seine Hand um Cernunnos' Kehle und drückte zu. Die Welt verschwamm vor Cernunnos' Augen, er konnte fühlen wie das Leben aus ihm wich und sich Agares darauf vorbereitete, seine Seele zu verzehren.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ein Donnerschlag erschütterte die Insel. Agares schrie vor Qual auf und ließ Cernunnos fallen. Ein erneuter Donnerschlag zerstörte Agares' Brustplatte und trieb den Gott weiter zurück. Das verdrehte Abbild von Cernunnos griff an, wurde von Hufen getroffen und über den Rand der Insel in den Abgrund geschleudert. Sucellus stand in der Mitte der Insel, ein wütender Gott in all seiner Herrlichkeit. Er blickte zu Cernunnos hinab, aber sein Blick wurde von dem schwarzen Spiegel eingefangen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos realisierte sofort was geschah, schlug mit all seiner Kraft auf den Spiegel ein und der Spiegel explodierte um sie herum. Große schwarze Scherben regneten um sie herum herab und Agares heulte vor Wut auf. Cernunnos ergriff einen Splitter, wollte ihn nach dem Gott der Verzweiflung werfen, aber Sucellus berührte ihn und die grauen Einöden von Agares' Hölle verschwanden.[PARAGRAPH:1]Zurück im Wald rief Sucellus jede Pflanze und jedes Tier an, befahl ihnen, sich auf den kommenden Kampf vorzubereiten. Während seine Präsenz durch den Wald glitt, konnte er Agares' Makel fühlen, wie er bereits eindrang. Der Wald wurde verdreht und korrumpiert. Das Gras verdorrte, Tiere wurden krank und flohen, verteilten ihre Krankheit in jedem Gebiet das sie durchquerten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos begann damit, die Ljosalfar zu organisieren. Sie hatten noch nie Krieg kennen gelernt, aber bald würden sie ihn kennen. Eine, eine junge Bildhauerin, blickte in den Splitter des schwarzen Spiegels den Cernunnos noch immer in der Hand hielt. Sie war wie gefroren, versteinert durch ihn. Ein geisterhaftes Abbild erschien neben ihr, ein Bild von ihr, aber bösartig und grausam. Cernunnos erschlug das Bild mit seiner mächtigen Faust und übergab den Splitter, mit der Oberfläche nach unten, der Elfe.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Verstecke diesen Splitter und lasse niemals jemanden einen Blick hinein werfen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Sie nahm den Splitter und entschwand sofort um die Aufgabe zu erfüllen. Es zog eine Schlacht herauf, aber Cernunnos hatte noch eines zu erledigen, bevor er sie beginnen könnte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Er kehrte zu seinem Heim unter der roten Eiche zurück. Gowers Mutter wartete draußen. Er brauchte nichts zu sagen, als er sich näherte begann sie zu weinen, den Kopf in ihren Händen verborgen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Kinder saßen dort, gefesselt von der Geschichte. Ihre Augen weiteten sich bei jedem Angriff und sie zuckten bei jeder Verteidigung zusammen.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Was geschah dann?" fragte Cewellyn.[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Geschichtenerzähler überdachte die Frage.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich wünschte ich könnte sagen die Dinge hätten besser gelegen, aber es wurde immer schlimmer. Sucellus und Danalin traten dem Krieg der Götter bei und die Schöpfung selbst wurde in den kommenden Wochen nahezu zerstört. Glücklicherweise, eigentlich genau deswegen, kamen die Götter zusammen, schlossen den Pakt und stimmten darin überein sich aus der Schöpfung zurückzuziehen. Alles wegen der Dinge, die von Gower begonnen wurden."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hat Sucellus Gower gerettet?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Nein, Ich glaube nicht. Aber beim Beltanefest halten die Nationen, die Cernunnos verehren, einen Ringkampf ab, um seinen geliebte Sohn zu ehren. Und bis zum heutigen Tag verbünden sich die Satyre, entfernte Kinder Cernunnos', mit jeder Nation die ihrem großen Vater folgt."[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Geschichtenerzähler pausierte. Beltane war schon in ein paar Nächten und er wollte, dass die Kinder verstanden, dass es mehr als nur ein paar Spiele war.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Aber es ist schon spät und mehr von dieser Geschichte muss bis zu einer anderen Nacht warten."[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Geschichtenerzähler schmunzelte als die Kinder seufzten und um ein bisschen mehr Zeit bettelten. Aber letztendlich akzeptierten sie seine Entscheidung und gingen in ihre Betten, wo sie von kämpfenden Göttern, Cernunnos und seinem geliebten Sohn träumten.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_3]Kapitel 3: Der Beltanezyklus[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_4]Kapitel 4: Der Beltanezyklus[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_5]Kapitel 5: Der Beltanezyklus[\LINK]</German>
		<Italian>[LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_1]Chapter 1: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE]Chapter 2: Beltane Cycle[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cernunnos, the great horned one, awoke to the whispers of the trees. They spoke of his son Gower, that he had left the protection of the forest. He was instantly up and charging through the forest. The Ljosalfar stared as his passing, unable to hear the trees and scared to see the greatest angel of Sucellus so enraged.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Where did he go? What of my children?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The chorus of answers surrounded him, "into the mountains...", "the children wait at the forests edge...", "Gower is gone...".[PARAGRAPH:1]As he ran he felt the presence of Sucellus beside him, calming him although Cernunnos didn't want to be calmed.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Why didn't you stop him?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Sucellus spoke directly to his archangel, his words resounded within him "This is no prison my child. Gower left of his own will, you cannot follow."[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos knew the truth of the words but refused to answer. In a few minutes he was at the forests edge where the rest of sons stood yelling for Gower to come back. Gower was just beginning the ascent, no more than a few hundred yards from the forests edge. Cernunnos stopped to command his other sons to return to the forests heart, but so terrible was his expression that he didn't even need to speak to send them all fleeing into the forest.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos yelled from the edge. His great voice echoed against the mountain and everyone in the forest heard his call but Gower continued on as if he hadn't. Frustrated Cernunnos ripped out a tree and slammed it into the ground. The mountainside trembled with the blow, sending rocks rolling down into the forest and even knocking down Gower as he climbed. But still he didn't look back.[PARAGRAPH:1]Even more angry Cernunnos picked up one of the loose rocks that had rolled into the forest and threw it at his son. The rock hit Gower on his shoulder and he fell in pain. But when he picked himself up he only looked up the mountain and hurried forward even faster.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos looked back into the forests heart. Sucellus hadn't moved from the great chamber of root and branches that was his home, but his spirit was there at the forests edge. Cernunnos only whispered "I'm sorry" and then jumped out onto the mountainside.[PARAGRAPH:1]Landing on the rocky slope Cernunnos felt the loss of Sucellus's ara for the first time. His body trembled and it felt like his soul was pulled out of him. Only the thought of his eldest son scrambling up the slope ahead of him allowed him to continue on. Cernunnos yelled Gower's name again as he picked himself up.[PARAGRAPH:1]A shadow fell over him. Cernunnos recognized the god of despair when he saw him and paled when Agares dropped between him and his son.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You were always my favorite of the archangels, are you as strong as they say?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares stood bathed in black and gold flames, he was beautiful and horrible. His lance was raised above his head and his 6 wings fully unfurled and blocking Cernunnos's sight of his son.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos summoned the strength to talk, "I only want my son, I have no quarrel with you."[PARAGRAPH:1]"If you want him," Agares smiled "come and get him."[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos charged forward, lowering his head he braced his shoulders for the impact. Nothing had ever resisted his charge, though he had never attacked a god before.[PARAGRAPH:1]Just before the strike a single feather fell off of Agares's wing. It landed on Cernunnos's back and drove the charging archangel to the ground. There he lay prostrate before the god of entropy, a single feather on his back. As much as he struggled, dug his hands into the earth and shattered the rocks beneath him Cernunnos could not rise.[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares knelt down beside Cernunnos, "Maybe next time will work out better for you." Then Agares was off into the sky, the shadow passed over Cernunnos and was gone.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos labored under the weight of the feather for the rest of the day. When the sun finally dipped below the mountains and Cernunnos was swallowed by the mountains shadow a breeze blew along the mountainside. Barely enough to ruffle hair the breeze picked up the feather which circled lazily in the breeze before slipping down and coming to rest at the forests edge.[PARAGRAPH:1]But Cernunnos was already gone. The mountain shook with each thunderous strike of his hooves as he charged up the mountain. He could see the silhouette of Gower at the mountains peak, standing, looking over the mountain. Cernunnos was terrified for his son but for a moment he had hope. Hope that he would reach him in time. Hope that his encounter with Agares had nothing to do with Gower. Then Agares stood up next to Gower on the mountains peak and that hope was gone.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos screamed, the mountains echoed that terrified yell back at him and over the forest below. The Ljosalfar cried in anguish and Cernunnos's other children echoed their fathers yell.[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares reached out and grabbed Gower by the throat. The satyr flailed helplessly in the gods powerful grip. Gower's muscles strained and turned red, his limbs trembled. Agares reached out with his other hand and opened a portal. There was a dark world beyond, full of ashes and pitch black seas. It was the ruins of a world now ground to dust. And Agares carried Gower through the portal.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos reached the top just as the portal began to close. Without thinking he leapt through.[PARAGRAPH:2]Cernunnos lost his connection with Sucellus when he left the forest. But he hadn't realized that he could feel the connection with each of the gods until it was taken from him. Passionate Bhall, loving Sirona, vigilant Junil all had some part in his soul and drove him from the forest to save his son. But this world was devoid of their voices. Here only one god remained, the god of despair, Agares.[PARAGRAPH:1]The world was ash in all directions. The sky was empty and although he had seen a dark river leading to a sea that seemed to reflect the empty sky Cernunnos couldn't see it now. But Cernunnos was not without talents, he was the archangel of nature and he reached his hands down into the grey earth and called for some living thing to respond. Something with strength, with warmth that could grow and change. The entire world could not be dead.[PARAGRAPH:1]And he felt it, the only life in this forgotten world, his son being dragged into a pit. Gower was still alive but in horrible pain. And for the first time Gower sensed Cernunnos as well and called out his father's name.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos was up and moving again. Across the endless grey, his breaths the only sound in this empty world and a wake of ashes left behind him. He followed his sons call until he came to a great pit. In the center a granite island floated and ashes eternally fell like sand from it into the darkness below. Agares stood on the island with the captured Gower.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos leapt. He flew across the expanse like a bird in flight and as he flew he heard, he felt, Gower's cries. Halfway across the expanse Agares squeezed the neck of the young satyr and he died. Gower's soul hung in the air, longed for the call of Sucellus to lead him to his eternal home but Agares reached out and consumed the satyr's soul instead.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos slammed into the side of the floating island. He cried out for his son in despair as he clawed his way up and over the lip of the island onto the top.[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares stood alone on the flat granite top. He casually tossed the broken body of Gower down in front of him and Cernunnos charged. Agares held out a hand to stop the enraged archangel and the entire world shuddered with the force of the impact. Agares was the heart of this world and he could not be moved. But so powerful was Cernunnos strike that the world was moved around him. Chasms opened up in the surface of the deepest hell, rivers poured into lost caverns, and Agares was laid prostrate before the mighty Cernunnos.[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares looked down at the horn marks in his black and gold breastplate. It was as great a hit as the he had ever received, but he was a god and would not fall to an archangels attack.[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares was on Cernunnos in full force. His lance forgotten Agares tore into the horned giant as a beast. Black and gold flames sheathed both of them, burning Cernunnos and he suffered through the physical attack and a similar assault on his soul. Both his body and his spirit were being crushed by the force of Agares. Agares grabbed Cernunnos's head and turned it to the smooth polished floor of the island, it was a perfect black mirror that reflected the pain and anguish Cernunnos was feeling.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You were always my favorite of the archangels." Agares whispered.[PARAGRAPH:1]From within the black mirror Cernunnos's image writhed and yelled. He shared all of Cernunnos's features but they were cast in blacks and reds instead of browns and green of the archangel. As Cernunnos watched in horror the image reached up through the surface and climbed out of the mirror. This dark version of him stood leering down at where Agares held him.[PARAGRAPH:1]Satisfied with his new creation Agares wrapped his hand around Cernunnos's throat and squeezed. The world swirled in Cernunnos's gaze, he could feel his life draining from him and Agares preparing to consume his soul.[PARAGRAPH:1]A crack of thunder shook the island. Agares screamed in pain and dropped Cernunnos. Another blow destroyed Agares's breastplate and drove the god back further. The twisted image of Cernunnos charged and was caught by deer hooves and kicked over the side of the island and into the pit. Sucellus stood in the center of the island, an angry god in all his glory. He looked down at Cernunnos but his gaze was caught in the black mirror.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos realized immediately what was happening so he struck the mirror with all his force and the mirror exploded around them. Great black shards rained over them and Agares howled in anger. Cernunnos picked up a shard, intending to throw it at the god of despair but Sucellus grabbed him and the grey wastes of Agares's hell disappeared beneath them.[PARAGRAPH:1]Back in the forest Sucellus called out to every plant and animal, ordering them to prepare for the coming battle. As his presence raced through the forest he could already feel Agares's taint invading. The forest was being twisted and corrupted. The grass withered, animals grew sick and fled, spreading their disease in any area they passed through.[PARAGRAPH:1]Cernunnos began organizing the Ljosalfar. They had never known war but they would soon. One, a young sculptor, looked into the shard of the black mirror Cernunnos still held. She was frozen, transfixed by it. A ghostly image appeared beside her, an image of her but malicious and cruel. Cernunnos crushed the image with his massive fist and handed the shard, face down, to the elf.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hide this, don't ever let anyone look into it."[PARAGRAPH:1]She took the shard it and rushed off immediately to perform the task. There was a battle coming, but Cernunnos had a task left to perform before he started it.[PARAGRAPH:1]He returned to his home beneath the red oak. Gower's mother was waiting outside. He didn't need to say anything, as he approached she fell weeping, her head in her hands.[PARAGRAPH:2]The children sat entranced by the story. Eyes widened with every attack and they quivered and mourned with each defeat.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What happened next?" Cewellyn asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]The storyteller considered the question.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I wish I could say that things were better but things became much worse. Sucellus and Danalin joined the Godswar and creation itself was nearly destroyed in the following weeks. Fortunately, rather than cause that, the gods came together to create the compact and agree to withdrawal from creation. All because of the events begun by Gower."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Did Sucellus rescue Gower?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, I don't believe so. But at Beltane the nations that revere Cernunnos hold a wrestling celebration that is in honor of his favored son. And to this day the satyrs, distant children of Cernunnos, ally themselves to any nation that follows their great father."[PARAGRAPH:1]The storyteller paused. Beltane was only a few nights away and he wanted the children to understand that these were more than just games.[PARAGRAPH:1]"But it is late and more of this story will have to wait for another night."[PARAGRAPH:1]The storyteller smiled as the children moaned and begged for a little more time. But they eventually accepted the storytellers statement and went off to their beds where they were met by dreams of battling gods, Cernunnos and his favorite son.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_3]Chapter 3: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_4]Chapter 4: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_5]Chapter 5: Beltane Cycle[\LINK]</Italian>

He didn't need to say anything, as he approached she fell weeping, her head in her hands.[PARAGRAPH:2]The children sat entranced by the story. Eyes widened with every attack and they quivered and mourned with each defeat.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What happened next?" Cewellyn asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]The storyteller considered the question.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I wish I could say that things were better but things became much worse. Sucellus and Danalin joined the Godswar and creation itself was nearly destroyed in the following weeks. Fortunately, rather than cause that, the gods came together to create the compact and agree to withdrawal from creation. All because of the events begun by Gower."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Did Sucellus rescue Gower?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, I don't believe so. But at Beltane the nations that revere Cernunnos hold a wrestling celebration that is in honor of his favored son. And to this day the satyrs, distant children of Cernunnos, ally themselves to any nation that follows their great father."[PARAGRAPH:1]The storyteller paused. Beltane was only a few nights away and he wanted the children to understand that these were more than just games.[PARAGRAPH:1]"But it is late and more of this story will have to wait for another night."[PARAGRAPH:1]The storyteller smiled as the children moaned and begged for a little more time. But they eventually accepted the storytellers statement and went off to their beds where they were met by dreams of battling gods, Cernunnos and his favorite son.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_3]Chapter 3: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_4]Chapter 4: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_5]Chapter 5: Beltane Cycle[\LINK]</Spanish>

A storm had ravaged the area and a glint of gold was visible in the dirt. Thinking it a coin he was surprised to find a golden feather. The feather was beautiful, unblemished by its time in the mud despite the fact that Hemah suspected it had been there for a very long time, and it had such a feeling of strong reality about it that it made everything around it seem less real.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan called for him from the horses. His accent was as perfect as the illusion Hemah's amulet wove around him. He would appear to everyone as a Lanun trader instead of a Svartalfar assassin. Even his impatience was indicative of his human persona, and Hemah wondered how much of it was an act.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I'm coming." Hemah slipped the feather into his robe and brushed the dirt from his sleeves, the signal that they were being watched. Alazkan was already aware of that and resisted the urge to roll his eyes at the mysterious, though talented, mage.[PARAGRAPH:1]Three days later found them in the heart of the forest. It was Beltane and the city was full of travelers intent on worship and games. A pair of new faces, even human ones wouldn't be noticed.[PARAGRAPH:1]Once Alazkan had shuttered the windows and checked the inn room he removed the amulet.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Have you found it?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah rubbed his eyes. He had been scrying the city all day but hadn't slept well for days. The Svartalfar provided him with incense that kept him from dreaming, but the sleep was empty. He was physically rested but it was becoming more difficult to focus his mind.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, there are three temples in the city. Between the three there is a small grove with a statue of a satyr. It is inside the statue."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Inside?" Alazkan asked, "is there a secret door in the statue?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I don't think so. They couldn't destroy it. So they built it into a statue to hide it."[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan was a talented thief, but he couldn't steal a statue from the Ljosalfar capital alone. And trying to chip away at a statue in the middle of a festival was bound to get someone's attention.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I'm going to need another illusion, and a time when no one will be in the grove."[PARAGRAPH:1]The festival provided the opportunity they needed. The regina procession, a parade of all of the Ljosalfar royalty lead by Arendel herself. Hemah and Alazkan stood waiting at the edge of the procession only a few hundred yards from the grove. Though they would be close to the crowds of Evermore no one would be watching the grove and the cheers should cover any noise they made.[PARAGRAPH:1]Adepts were preparing for the procession. All were dressed in elven finery and practicing the minor illusions that would enhance the parade. Hemah scoffed at the obvious strain they spent on starlight or glowing effects on the chariots. One adept struggled to make a deer carved in the side of chariot look to leap and dance along the chariot's side.[PARAGRAPH:1]Then Hemah saw her. She was going to each of the adepts, making sure they were ready and encouraging them. She went from one display to the next, she had mastered every illusion and easily recreated it for each adept. Showing him how to improve it or making sure it was just right. She stopped at the struggling adept, held his hands against hers and let him feel her movements as she cast the spell. It was perfect and in his next attempt he had it as well.[PARAGRAPH:1]She was beautiful and for the first time Hemah felt guilty for helping the Svartalfar steal from this city. It had been a long time since he had felt guilty for anything.[PARAGRAPH:1]The horns rang out and the crowds pushed toward the center of Evermore. The beautiful archmage slipped into the palace and the procession began. As elven royalty began coming out of the palace to enter their enchanted chariots Alazkan grabbed Hemah's elbow.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Come on."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah resisted, hoping the she would come back. But gave in at another pull from Alazkan and followed him through the crowd.[PARAGRAPH:1]Outside the grove their wagon waited. Four bulls pulled it and the open back was reinforced with enough iron to be able to carry the statue. There was a rune inscribed on the wagon bed, though for now it was inert.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan lead the wagon into the grove while Hemah walked alongside. They could hear the crowd getting louder as each set of nobles got progressively more famous. But not everyone was watching the procession, a disciple was startled to see the wagon cutting through the small grove.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What are you doing? Get that wagon out of here!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah started the excuse they had prepared, "I'm so sorry, the road ahead was blocked and we..."[PARAGRAPH:1]The rest of the story was unnecessary as Alazkan had already killed him. A sword strike, body caught before it dropped to the ground and slipped into the back of the wagon. Hemah was suddenly glad that if he were to die Alazkan's amulet would stop working and he would be revealed as a Svartalfar in the center of the Ljosalfar capital.[PARAGRAPH:1]The crowds cheered and horns announced the entrance of Arendel herself.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Help me," Alazkan ordered, throwing ropes around the statue.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah did, tying them off and signaling that he was ready for the wagon to pull. Alazkan whipped the bulls forward until the ropes pulled taunt, there was brief second of pause when nothing moved and then the statue fell forward against the wagon's back.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan stopped the bulls, then locked the wheels in place and adjusted the ropes. While he set the bulls to be able to pull the statue up into the wagon Hemah inscribed a rune on the ground where the statue used to stand. When he was finished he cast his spell and an illusionary statue stood in the old statue's place.[PARAGRAPH:1]By that time Alazkan had the statue in the wagon and was calling for Hemah to hurry up. Hemah jumped into the wagon bed and traced over the rune he had inscribed there. The statue in the wagon bed shimmered and disappeared, leaving the wagon bed apparently empty as long as no one noticed that it sat low on its wheels and its wheels cut heavy grooves in the ground.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan looked back and smiled, "I don't think were supposed to be here friend, what say we try to get out to real roads?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah nodded.[PARAGRAPH:1]The ride out of Evermore was uneventful, outside of that single disciple and the hordes of people watching the procession the city was empty. With luck it would take days for anyone to notice the statue had been stolen and by then it would be safely outside of their forest. But the further Hemah rode on the wagon the more anxious he got.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I can't leave yet."[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan eyed him suspiciously, "You are far too useful to be discarded after this mission if that is what you are worrying about."[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, I just want to explore Evermore more. There may be more artifacts here, it's supposed to have been the same location the elves once shared with Sucellus."[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan considered his options, as always killing anyone presenting the least risk weighed highly in his thinking. But he either decided that Hemah may be right in finding even more treasures in the Ljosalfar city, or the mage truly scared him. Either way he decided to let him go. He reached into his tunic and produced the pouch of incense that was Hemah's payment.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Very well, let me know if you find something worth stealing and we can try it again. Next time I want to be a Grigori nobleman. I have some ideas for some great insults and I can put down Cernunnos at every opportunity."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah smiled, "I will do that, the shadows greet you."[PARAGRAPH:1]"And you brother."[PARAGRAPH:1]With that Alazkan drove the wagon out into the forest and Hemah turned and began walking back into Evermore.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_4]Chapter 4: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_5]Chapter 5: Beltane Cycle[\LINK]</English>

Ein Sturm hatte die Gegend verwüstet und das Glitzern von Gold war im Schmutz zu erkennen. Er glaubte er würde eine Münze finden, doch zu seiner Überraschung war es eine goldene Feder. Die Feder war schön, makellos obwohl sie im Schmutz gelegen hatte und Hemah vermutete, dass sie dort schon einige Zeit gelegen haben müsse. Sie hatte außerdem eine Aura unglaublich starker Realität um sich, die alles andere weniger real wirken ließ.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan stand bei den Pferden und rief nach ihm. Sein Akzent war so perfekt wie die Illusion, die Hemahs Amulett um ihn herum aufgebaut hatte. Er würde jedermann als ein Händler der Lanun erscheinen, statt als Assassine der Svartalfar. Selbst seine Ungeduld war typisch für seine menschliche Persona und Hemah fragte sich, wie viel davon wirklich nur gespielt war.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich komme." Hemah verstaute die Feder in seiner Robe und schlug sich Schmutz von seinen Ärmeln, das Signal, dass sie beobachtet wurden. Alazkan hatte es bereits bemerkt und widerstand dem Drang die Augen über den geheimnisvollen, jedoch auch talentierten, Magier zu rollen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bereits drei Tage später befanden sie sich im Herzen des Waldes. Es war die Zeit von Beltane und die Stadt war voll von Reisenden, bedacht auf Verehrung und auch auf Spiele. Ein paar neuer Gesichter, selbst menschliche, würde nicht auffallen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nachdem Alazkan die Fenster geschlossen und den Innenraum der Gaststätte überprüft hatte, nahm er das Amulett ab.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Habt Ihr es gefunden?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah rieb sich die Augen. Er hatte die Stadt den ganzen Tag lang durchsucht und schon seit Tagen nicht mehr gut geschlafen. Die Svartalfar versorgten ihn mit einem Mittel, das ihn vom Träumen abhielt, aber sein Schlaf war leer. Er war körperlich erholt, aber es wurde zunehmend schwieriger, seinen Geist zu fokussieren.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ja, es gibt drei Tempel in der Stadt. Zwischenen ihnen liegt ein kleiner Hain, in dem die Statue eines Satyr steht. Es ist in dieser Statue."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Innen?" fragte Alazkan nach, "gibt es eine geheime Tür hinein?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich denke nicht. Sie konnte es nicht zerstören. Also haben sie in eine Statue hineingebaut, um es zu verbergen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan war ein talentierter Dieb, aber auch er konnte alleine keine Statue aus der Hauptstadt der Ljosalfar stehlen. Und mitten während des Festes zu versuchen eine Statue abzuschlagen war geradezu prädestiniert dazu, von irgendjemandem gesehen zu werden.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich werde eine weitere Illusion brauchen und eine Zeit, in der niemand in diesem Hain ist."[PARAGRAPH:1]Das Fest bot die Gelegenheit, die sie benötigten. Die Königsprozession, eine Parade aller Edlen der Ljosalfar, angeführt von Arendel selbst. Hemah und Alazkan standen abwartend am Rande der Prozession, nur wenige hundert Meter von dem Hain entfernt. Sie wären zwar nahe an den Massen von Evermore, aber niemand würde auf den Hain achten und die Jubelrufe würden jeden Lärm überdecken, den sie machen würden.[PARAGRAPH:1]Adepten bereiteten die Prozession vor. Alle waren in elfisches Geschmeide gekleidet und befassten sich mit den kleineren Illusionen, die die Parade verschönern würden. Hemah war belustigt über die offenkundigen Anstrengungen, die sie für Sternenlicht oder Leuchteffekte auf den Streitwagen unternahmen. Ein Adept mühte sich mit einem Hirsch ab, der in die Seite eines Streitwagens geschnitzt war und so aussehen sollte, als würde er dort springen und tanzen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dann sah Hemah sie. Sie ging zu jedem Adepten, stellte sicher, dass sie fertig waren, und sprach ihnen gut zu. Sie ging von einer zu verschönernden Stelle zur nächsten, sie hatte jedwede Illusion gemeistert und sie schnell und einfach für jeden Adepten neu erschaffen. Sie zeigte ihnen wie sie sie verbessern könnten oder stellte nur sicher, dass sie richtig waren. Sie hielt neben dem sich abmühenden Adepten an, nahm seine Hände in ihre und ließ ihn ihre Bewegungen spüren, während sie den Spruch ausführte. Es war perfekt und bei seinem nächsten Versuch hatte er ihn bereits verinnerlicht.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sie war wunderschön und das allererste Mal fühlte Hemah sich schuldig, den Svartalfar dabei zu helfen diese Stadt zu bestehlen. Es war schon sehr lange her, dass er sich überhaupt für etwas schuldig gefühlt hatte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Hörner erschallten und die Massen drängten zu Zentrum von Evermore. Die schöne Erzmagierin schlüpfte in den Palast und die Prozession begann. Als die ersten Noblen aus dem Palast kamen, um ihre verzauberten Streitwagen zu besteigen, zupfte Alazkan Hemah am Ärmel.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Komm schon."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah blieb stehen, hoffte darauf, sie würde zurück kommen. Nach einem weiteren Zupfer Alazkans gab er nach und folgte ihm durch die Massen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Außerhalb des Hains wartete ihr Wagen. Vier Bullen zogen ihn und das offene Heck war mit so viel Eisen verstärkt, dass sie in der Lage wären, die Statue zu transportieren. Im Boden des Wagens war eine Rune eingelassen, aber im Moment war sie noch inaktiv.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan lenkte den Wagen in den Hain und Hemah ging nebenher. Sie konnten hören, wie die Menge immer lauter wurde, je bekannter die Edlen wurden, die den Palast verließen. Aber nicht jeder beobachtete die Prozession, ein junger Geweihter sah den Wagen, wie er durch den Hain rumpelte.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Was macht ihr denn da? Schafft den Wagen hier weg!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah begann mit der Entschuldigung, die sie vorbereitet hatten: "Es tut mir Leid, aber die Straße da vorne ist blockiert und wir..."[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Rest der Geschichte war nicht mehr nötig, da Alazkan den Geweihten bereits getötet hatte. Ein Schwertstreich, den Körper aufgefangen bevor er auf dem Boden aufschlug und dann auf den Wagen geworfen. Hemah war plötzlich froh, dass, wenn er sterben sollte, sein Amulett aufhören würde zu arbeiten und Alazkan als Svartalfar mitten in der Hauptstadt der Ljosalfar enttarnen würde.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Massen jubelten und die Hörner kündigten Arendel höchstselbst an.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hilf mir." befahl Alazkan, während er Stricke um die Statue warf.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah tat so, verknotete sie und gab das Zeichen, dass der Wagen ziehen könne. Alazkan trieb die Bullen an bis die Stricke gestrafft waren, es gab eine kurze Sekunden der Stille und dann kippte sie Statue nach vorne und gegen das Heck des Wagens.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan stoppte die Bullen, blockierte die Räder und ordnete die Stricke neu an. Während er die Bullen neu gruppierte, sodass sie die Statue in den Wagen ziehen würden, zeichnete Hemah dort, wo die Statue gestanden hatte, eine Rune in den Boden. Als er fertig war wirkte er seinen Spruch und eine Illusion der Statue entstand genau dort, wo die alte vorher gestanden hatte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Zu der Zeit hatte Alazkan die Statue bereits in den Wagen bekommen und rief Hemah an, sich zu beeilen. Hemah sprang in den Wagen und strich über die Rune, die er dort vorbereitet hatte. Die Statue im Wagen schimmerte und verschwand, sodass der Wagen leer erschien, solange niemand bemerkte, dass er tiefer lag und seine Räder tiefe Spuren in den Boden gruben.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan sah zurück und grinste, "Ich denke wir sollten nicht hier sein, mein Freund, was haltet Ihr davon, wenn wir versuchen zurück auf richtige Straßen zu gelangen?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah nickte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Reise aus Evermore hinaus war ereignislos, abgesehen von dem einen Geweihten und den Horden von Zuschauern der Prozession war die Stadt leer. Mit etwas Glück würde es noch Tage dauern, bis der Diebstahl der Statue bemerkt würde, und dann wäre sie bereits sicher außerhalb des Waldes. Aber je weiter sie sich entfernten, desto unruhiger wurde Hemah.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich kann noch nicht gehen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan beäugte ihn misstrauisch, "Ihr seid viel zu nützlich, als dass ihr nach dieser Mission gehen gelassen würdet, falls es das ist was ihr wollt."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Nein, ich möchte einfach nur Evermore etwas mehr erkunden. Es könnte noch viel mehr Artefakte geben, es wird vermutet, dass hier der Ort ist, den die Elfen einst mit Sucellus teilten."[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan überdachte seine Optionen, einer seiner ersten Gedanken war immer, jemanden zu töten und so das geringste Risiko einzugehen. Aber entweder kam er zu dem Schluss, dass Hemah recht haben könnte und es noch mehr interessante Artefakte in der Hauptstadt der Ljosalfar gab, oder er der Magier beängstigte ihn wirklich. Auf jeden Fall entschied er sich ihn gehen zu lassen. Er griff in seinen Umhang und zog einen Beutel mit dem Mittel heraus, das Hemahs Bezahlung war.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Nun gut, lasst es mich wissen, wenn ihr etwas anderes findet das stehlenswert ist und wir versuchen es erneut. Nächstes Mal möchte ich ein Nobler der Grigori sein. Ich habe ein paar Ideen für ein paar Zwischenfälle und ich könnte Cernunnos bei jeder sich bietenden Gelegenheit demütigen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah grinste, "Werde ich machen, mögen die Schatten mit dir sein."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Und mit dir, Bruder."[PARAGRAPH:1]Mit diesen Worten lenkte Alazkan den Wagen weiter hinaus in den Wald und Hemah ging zurück nach Evermore.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_4]Kapitel 4: Der Beltanezyklus[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_5]Kapitel 5: Der Beltanezyklus[\LINK]</German>

A storm had ravaged the area and a glint of gold was visible in the dirt. Thinking it a coin he was surprised to find a golden feather. The feather was beautiful, unblemished by its time in the mud despite the fact that Hemah suspected it had been there for a very long time, and it had such a feeling of strong reality about it that it made everything around it seem less real.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan called for him from the horses. His accent was as perfect as the illusion Hemah's amulet wove around him. He would appear to everyone as a Lanun trader instead of a Svartalfar assassin. Even his impatience was indicative of his human persona, and Hemah wondered how much of it was an act.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I'm coming."

He had been scrying the city all day but hadn't slept well for days. The Svartalfar provided him with incense that kept him from dreaming, but the sleep was empty. He was physically rested but it was becoming more difficult to focus his mind.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, there are three temples in the city. Between the three there is a small grove with a statue of a satyr. It is inside the statue."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Inside?" Alazkan asked, "is there a secret door in the statue?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I don't think so. They couldn't destroy it. So they built it into a statue to hide it."[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan was a talented thief, but he couldn't steal a statue from the Ljosalfar capital alone. And trying to chip away at a statue in the middle of a festival was bound to get someone's attention.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I'm going to need another illusion, and a time when no one will be in the grove."[PARAGRAPH:1]The festival provided the opportunity they needed. The regina procession, a parade of all of the Ljosalfar royalty lead by Arendel herself. Hemah and Alazkan stood waiting at the edge of the procession only a few hundred yards from the grove. Though they would be close to the crowds of Evermore no one would be watching the grove and the cheers should cover any noise they made.[PARAGRAPH:1]Adepts were preparing for the procession. All were dressed in elven finery and practicing the minor illusions that would enhance the parade. Hemah scoffed at the obvious strain they spent on starlight or glowing effects on the chariots. One adept struggled to make a deer carved in the side of chariot look to leap and dance along the chariot's side.[PARAGRAPH:1]Then Hemah saw her. She was going to each of the adepts, making sure they were ready and encouraging them. She went from one display to the next, she had mastered every illusion and easily recreated it for each adept. Showing him how to improve it or making sure it was just right. She stopped at the struggling adept, held his hands against hers and let him feel her movements as she cast the spell. It was perfect and in his next attempt he had it as well.[PARAGRAPH:1]She was beautiful and for the first time Hemah felt guilty for helping the Svartalfar steal from this city. It had been a long time since he had felt guilty for anything.[PARAGRAPH:1]The horns rang out and the crowds pushed toward the center of Evermore. The beautiful archmage slipped into the palace and the procession began. As elven royalty began coming out of the palace to enter their enchanted chariots Alazkan grabbed Hemah's elbow.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Come on."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah resisted, hoping the she would come back. But gave in at another pull from Alazkan and followed him through the crowd.[PARAGRAPH:1]Outside the grove their wagon waited. Four bulls pulled it and the open back was reinforced with enough iron to be able to carry the statue. There was a rune inscribed on the wagon bed, though for now it was inert.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan lead the wagon into the grove while Hemah walked alongside. They could hear the crowd getting louder as each set of nobles got progressively more famous. But not everyone was watching the procession, a disciple was startled to see the wagon cutting through the small grove.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What are you doing? Get that wagon out of here!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah started the excuse they had prepared, "I'm so sorry, the road ahead was blocked and we..."[PARAGRAPH:1]The rest of the story was unnecessary as Alazkan had already killed him. A sword strike, body caught before it dropped to the ground and slipped into the back of the wagon. Hemah was suddenly glad that if he were to die Alazkan's amulet would stop working and he would be revealed as a Svartalfar in the center of the Ljosalfar capital.[PARAGRAPH:1]The crowds cheered and horns announced the entrance of Arendel herself.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Help me," Alazkan ordered, throwing ropes around the statue.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah did, tying them off and signaling that he was ready for the wagon to pull. Alazkan whipped the bulls forward until the ropes pulled taunt, there was brief second of pause when nothing moved and then the statue fell forward against the wagon's back.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan stopped the bulls, then locked the wheels in place and adjusted the ropes. While he set the bulls to be able to pull the statue up into the wagon Hemah inscribed a rune on the ground where the statue used to stand. When he was finished he cast his spell and an illusionary statue stood in the old statue's place.[PARAGRAPH:1]By that time Alazkan had the statue in the wagon and was calling for Hemah to hurry up. Hemah jumped into the wagon bed and traced over the rune he had inscribed there. The statue in the wagon bed shimmered and disappeared, leaving the wagon bed apparently empty as long as no one noticed that it sat low on its wheels and its wheels cut heavy grooves in the ground.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan looked back and smiled, "I don't think were supposed to be here friend, what say we try to get out to real roads?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah nodded.[PARAGRAPH:1]The ride out of Evermore was uneventful, outside of that single disciple and the hordes of people watching the procession the city was empty. With luck it would take days for anyone to notice the statue had been stolen and by then it would be safely outside of their forest. But the further Hemah rode on the wagon the more anxious he got.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I can't leave yet."[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan eyed him suspiciously, "You are far too useful to be discarded after this mission if that is what you are worrying about."[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, I just want to explore Evermore more. There may be more artifacts here, it's supposed to have been the same location the elves once shared with Sucellus."[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan considered his options, as always killing anyone presenting the least risk weighed highly in his thinking. But he either decided that Hemah may be right in finding even more treasures in the Ljosalfar city, or the mage truly scared him. Either way he decided to let him go. He reached into his tunic and produced the pouch of incense that was Hemah's payment.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Very well, let me know if you find something worth stealing and we can try it again. Next time I want to be a Grigori nobleman. I have some ideas for some great insults and I can put down Cernunnos at every opportunity."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah smiled, "I will do that, the shadows greet you."[PARAGRAPH:1]"And you brother."[PARAGRAPH:1]With that Alazkan drove the wagon out into the forest and Hemah turned and began walking back into Evermore.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_4]Chapter 4: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_5]Chapter 5: Beltane Cycle[\LINK]</Italian>

A storm had ravaged the area and a glint of gold was visible in the dirt. Thinking it a coin he was surprised to find a golden feather. The feather was beautiful, unblemished by its time in the mud despite the fact that Hemah suspected it had been there for a very long time, and it had such a feeling of strong reality about it that it made everything around it seem less real.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan called for him from the horses. His accent was as perfect as the illusion Hemah's amulet wove around him. He would appear to everyone as a Lanun trader instead of a Svartalfar assassin. Even his impatience was indicative of his human persona, and Hemah wondered how much of it was an act.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I'm coming." Hemah slipped the feather into his robe and brushed the dirt from his sleeves, the signal that they were being watched. Alazkan was already aware of that and resisted the urge to roll his eyes at the mysterious, though talented, mage.[PARAGRAPH:1]Three days later found them in the heart of the forest. It was Beltane and the city was full of travelers intent on worship and games. A pair of new faces, even human ones wouldn't be noticed.[PARAGRAPH:1]Once Alazkan had shuttered the windows and checked the inn room he removed the amulet.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Have you found it?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah rubbed his eyes. He had been scrying the city all day but hadn't slept well for days. The Svartalfar provided him with incense that kept him from dreaming, but the sleep was empty. He was physically rested but it was becoming more difficult to focus his mind.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, there are three temples in the city. Between the three there is a small grove with a statue of a satyr. It is inside the statue."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Inside?" Alazkan asked, "is there a secret door in the statue?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I don't think so. They couldn't destroy it. So they built it into a statue to hide it."[PARAGRAPH:1]Alazkan was a talented thief, but he couldn't steal a statue from the Ljosalfar capital alone. And trying to chip away at a statue in the middle of a festival was bound to get someone's attention.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I'm going to need another illusion, and a time when no one will be in the grove."[PARAGRAPH:1]The festival provided the opportunity they needed.

He had been the least interested in the festival and outside of his religious obligations hadn't attended many of the games or displays that crowded the elven capital.[PARAGRAPH:1]Priest Tuathal watched the flowerbed in concern. The flowers that each bloomed during different parts of the day, arrayed in an arc in order as they bloomed. Numbers marked each section and allowed the flowerbed to function as a large living clock as it was easy to tell the time by looking at the flowers that were in bloom. It was nearly noon and Wyren was still missing.[PARAGRAPH:1]A squirrel chattered loudly above the priest, hoping he may have some treats. Tuathal scowled back, unhappy to see the animal expecting to be fed rather than gathering the food from the forest himself. But the squirrel wouldn't give up and followed the priest from tree to tree as he walked into the grove between the three temples.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tuathal quietly prayed for some guidance. He couldn't help but feel that something bad had happened to Wyren even if everything else seemed normal. Unhappy at being ignored the squirrel climbed out on the branch closest to Tuathal and then jumped from there onto the satyr statue at the center of the grove. But instead of landing gracefully on the satyr's broad arm the squirrel passed completely through the statue and landed with a confused thud on the ground.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tuathal stared in surprise at the squirrel and the statue he had just jumped through. Pulling an acorn from his pocket he scooped the squirrel up onto his shoulder and gave him the nut while studying the statue. The squirrel studied it suspiciously as well.[PARAGRAPH:1]Slowly reaching out Tuathal's hand passed effortlessly through the statue; it was only an illusion. The real statue was gone.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hemah watched as the grove filled up with priests, city watch, and mages investigating the missing statue. He wasn't worried about being noticed, as a significant crowd of curious travelers, disciples and adepts had turned up to watch what was going on.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon, an elven man with golden hair and green eyes was leading the investigation. He wore the garb of a watch captain but it was obvious from his bearing that he was nobility as well. The captain checked out the statue himself and then after conferring with a shrugging group of mages ordered someone to get Thessa. Hemah leaned forward in interest, this was the first time he had heard her name but he suspected he already knew who she was.[PARAGRAPH:1]While he waited the captain investigated the rest of the grove, ordering people back. He found wagon tracks leading into the grove, and the heavier set leading out. They lead back out to one of the busiest roads in Evermore, where they were impossible to track. But he sent a group of soldiers down the road anyway to see what they could find. He asked another to start questioning the local wagoneers to see if anyone had stored or purchased a wagon capable of carrying a marble statue in the past few days. The day after Beltane there were hundreds of wagons in Evermore that fit that description, but the lieutenant accepted his charge and set off to perform it.[PARAGRAPH:1]Shortly afterwards a beautiful archmage entered the grove and the theorizing mages grew quiet. She talked quietly with the captain, asked a few questions to the mages, who shrugged again, and then went over and knelt down by the statue.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Is the statue of anyone in particular?" she asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]Priest Tuathal scowled but controlled himself before responding, "Surely your studies keep you too long from the temple lady Thessa. The statue is of Gower, favored son of Cernunnos, who was killed by Agares during the first Age. This statue was erected by the elves of that age in memory of him. It is one of the oldest relics in Evermore."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thieves usually aren't that interested in history and there are a thousand statues in Evermore that would have been easier to steal. Is there any reason why this one would be more valuable?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The priest cleared his throat. The eyes of everyone in the grove went to him and the squirrel on his shoulder glared back at everyone.[PARAGRAPH:1]After an awkward silence Tuathal said, "we may need to talk about that in private."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon ordered one of his guards to have the priest taken into the temple for a more private conversation. But Thessa ignored the response, to her it was just another example of how the traditions of the Ljosalfar were keeping it from moving ahead. Taking a deep breath she closed her eyes and began to cast.[PARAGRAPH:1]If she was beautiful, she was even more beautiful while in the throes of magic. Her dark hair, unusual among the Ljosalfar, fluttered and her body strained as she channeled the power needed to cast the spell. Hemah recognized it, she would be trying to follow the link between the illusion and the one maintaining it. She was trying to find him. But just before her spell was completed Hemah released the illusion and the statue disappeared.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What happened, did you dispel it?" Devon asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]With the object of her spell gone Thessa struggled to release the magic harmlessly. Her hands glowed as if stars danced from them and then faded out.[PARAGRAPH:1]"No," Thessa answered, "I hadn't done anything yet. The caster released the spell before I could follow it back to him."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon looked up at the assembled group of spectators, who dumbly returned his gaze. He turned to the last of his lieutenants.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Have everyone here be brought to the barracks for questioning."[PARAGRAPH:1]A few hours later Hemah was still sitting in the barracks waiting to be questioned. All of the citizens of Evermore had been first, and questioning them went relatively quickly. But they were taking their time with the travelers. Hemah had already released the spell he cast on Alazkan's amulet, he hoped it hid him for long enough. And unlike most mages he didn't keep anything magical on him. He was less concerned with the questioning then he was in making sure he got the right questioner.[PARAGRAPH:1]Fortunately Thessa was in charge of examining all the travelers and just after nightfall his name was called and he was shuffled into a small office with her. Thessa looked over the notes a soldier had collected on the group and the items they had taken from Hemah.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Are these yours?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes," Hemah answered.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What are you doing in Evermore?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I came for the festival." Hemah said somewhat honestly.[PARAGRAPH:1]"A common answer today, do you worship Cernunnos?" Thessa asked the questions as a matter of protocol, she was more interested in looking through the items he had. She had the golden feather, mask and bag of incense laid out on the table and she was carefully examining the feather.[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, I'm not really religious. Though I do enjoy the sights of Evermore and the festival."[PARAGRAPH:1]This was the first time Thessa looked up at him, most of the people she talked to today claimed to be worshipers even if they weren't. He had a gentle face, almost soft and would be handsome if he didn't look so tired. He didn't match what she would expect from a merchant, mage or one of the many people that flocked to Evermore for the festival.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What of these items?" she asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The mask is for the festival," Hemah lied, he wore the mask to keep him from seeing his own reflection. That helped keep him from dreaming about himself, which was an exhilarating and terrifying experience.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The feather I found on the edges of your empire. I've only had it for a few days and I'm not sure what to make of it."[PARAGRAPH:1]"It is beautiful." Thessa was more practical than most of the Ljosalfar, and had never seen much value in spiritual or artistic matters but she couldn't deny the draw of the feather. She tested it several times before Hemah came into the room and it was the reason she wanted to question him directly. It wasn't magical, but she couldn't believe the draw it had without magical means.[PARAGRAPH:1]"It's the second most beautiful thing I've seen in your lands."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah's meaning was obvious from the way he was looking at her, but Thessa pretended to miss the compliment.[PARAGRAPH:1]"And the incense?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"It helps me sleep." Hemah honestly responded, "I have troubling dreams sometimes, but if I burn the incense in the room with me I don't have them."[PARAGRAPH:1]"This is an ancient elven craft, I'm surprised to see anyone with it, especially a human. Did you buy it from someone at the festival?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, I met a merchant in Kingsport with it. But I don't know how he got it."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah paused before continuing.[PARAGRAPH:1]"About the feather... I'd like you to have it."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa looked surprised and suspicious so Hemah continued.[PARAGRAPH:1]"As I said, I found it at the edge of your empire, so if anything it is yours anyway. It is too beautiful to be stuffed into my tunic for months on end."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa would never accept a gift from someone being investigated. The fact that he was offering a gift implied his guilt. But she couldn't help feeling that this was different, that this man was lonely and out of place, but not responsible for the disappearance of the statue or disciple Wyren. And she found herself unable to turn down the feather.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Are you sure? This won't affect the investigation at all. You will still likely spend the night in jail."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah nodded, "I'm sure."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa tucked the feather in her dark hair and smiled at him. That vision was forever burned into Hemah's heart and it was all he could do to keep from professing his eternal love for her. Then she leaned across, kissed him gently on the cheek, whispered her thanks and left the room. He was left stunned.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon was watching the interview. There were only a handful of suspects that seemed out of place. Though he suspected they were all dead ends. But seeing Thessa kiss the pale human caused a turmoil of emotions that he was unable to understand.[PARAGRAPH:1]When she came out of the room they met to discuss the results of the interviews. Thessa didn't know he had seen the kiss but sensed immediately that he was distant. As they went through each of the suspects they easily agreed to hold or release each of them until they came to Hemah.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Do you think he is a mage without magic, a kidnapper without a victim, an attacker without a weapon and a thief without the goods? We found the wagoneer that sold the missing wagon, the man he described doesn't match any of our suspects. What is it you suspect about this one?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon was unaccustomed to being so directly questioned from anyone except Thessa, it was one of the things that he loved about her. She was right, but even without the kiss there was something about Hemah that bothered him. Devon's father was an angel in Sucellus's charge and that divine birthright usually made his instincts correct.[PARAGRAPH:1]Unable to settle the dispute they asked priest Tuathal's opinion. He peeked into the room where Hemah sat quietly and considered him. After a few minutes he simply said, "I agree with Devon, there is something suspicious about the man that warrants more scrutiny. I would have him held until we find out more."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon gave the order before Thessa could object. Then Tuathal stepped in to cool the stubborn archmage's temper.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I heard that Devon proposed to you at the festival dance last night. I am sorry it took me so long to congratulate your betrothal."[PARAGRAPH:1]Tuathal's tactic worked and Thessa let her argument go in the face of the priest's good wishes.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, it was an amazing night. I couldn't be happier."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon was also relaxed by the memories of the previous night, "Now we have only to set a day."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa smiled, Hemah's plight was forgotten.[PARAGRAPH:1]A few minutes later guards came and told Hemah he was to be held for further questioning. They led him to a cell where he was locked up with a few pickpockets and a handful of others that were suspected of having something to do with the theft. He went peacefully to the cell, and only argued that he needed his incense so he could sleep. They refused to give it to him and ignored his requests.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah stayed up for most of the night but as the hours went by he found himself drifting off in short bursts. The sleep from the incense wasn't that restful so it had been weeks since he had really slept. In his short bursts of dreams he saw visions of Thessa, the satyr statue, the golden feather as part of the wings of an ancient god, and that god's attack on this very forest. Visions of withered trees and disease.[PARAGRAPH:1]He shook himself awake. These dreams were horrible but he was so tired that he was falling asleep even as he paced back and forth. Eventually the dreams won.[PARAGRAPH:1]When he awoke the barracks was full of concerned guards, mages and priests. Devon was organizing the efforts and getting reports from scouts checking in from various edges of the forest. After a few hours the guards remembered the travelers they had detained and, seeing no opportunity to pursue the investigation and little hope of finding anything if they did, opened the cell and let them go.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah had his mask, incense and other items returned and he was released onto the streets of Evermore. Devon excused himself from his meeting and caught up with Hemah as he walked away from the barracks.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You, where are you going?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah couldn't believe he was going to go through this again.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The guards released me, they said the investigation was suspended."[PARAGRAPH:1]"I know," Devon responded. "I mean you will be leaving Evermore. You will be leaving our forest. You won't return."[PARAGRAPH:1]The captain looked angry and Hemah noticed that the other suspects that had been released weren't given the same speech.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I was hoping to talk to the woman who questioned me before I left. Do you know where she is?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The captain's eyes narrowed, Hemah had found the point of the captain's anger at him and immediately regretted asking the question.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Her name is Thessa, and she is betrothed to me. You will not talk to her."[PARAGRAPH:1]At that Devon called a guard over and ordered him to escort Hemah to the edge of the forest. The guard agreed and with a final glare from Devon Hemah was led away from the barracks.[PARAGRAPH:1]As Hemah walked beside the guard he put on his mask. He was an amazing caster and could cast minor spells simply from sheer strength of will. Especially after the prior night's sleep, he felt more rested than he had in months. As he walked he reached out to the guard's mind. He would travel out to the forests edge alone, all the while believing Hemah walked beside him and left without any problems.[PARAGRAPH:1]After the spell was firmly in place Hemah cut down an alleyway and headed to the mage guild of the city, where he guessed Thessa would be searching for a cause of the corruption that occurred last night.[PARAGRAPH:1]There were three ways to become invisible. Bend light around your body, create an illusion on your body of the surface behind it or simply trick the mind of the person looking at you so that they don't think they see you. It was this last form that Hemah used as he walked into the mage guild. He scanned ahead, finding elves and blocking their mind to his presence. Technically everyone he walked by saw him as he wandered through the hallways and studies of the guild, but they didn't realize it.[PARAGRAPH:1]He didn't try to include Thessa in the spell. She was looking through piles of ancient tomes when he entered the room. She still had the golden feather in her hair.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thessa."[PARAGRAPH:1]She didn't recognize the voice and it took her a second to match the mask with the one she examined the day before. He had a commanding presence and she could feel the magic radiating from him. This figure was much different than the lonely young man she interviewed and a quick touch of her ring warned Devon that she was in danger.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hemah? What are you doing here?"[PARAGRAPH:1]She reached out and felt the magic flowing through the room, mentally preparing to defend herself against a mental or physical assault. Without thinking she pushed the tomes aside to keep them from getting damaged.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I came for you, this blight consumes hope. It will destroy you or Evermore. You must get out of here."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Did you create it?" What she had seen of the corruption growing in the forest was beyond anything she had seen before. She sensed a lot of power in Hemah, but the corruption was something greater.[PARAGRAPH:1]"No," Hemah replied. "You did. It's a memory of an affliction that struck the forest long ago. It was eventually stopped by an angel, but no such angel exists to stop it now. Come with me."[PARAGRAPH:1]"How do you know about the source of the corruption?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah could feel her gathering power. She was planning to attack him but she wanted to see what she could learn from him first.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thessa, I don't know the answer to that, things are revealed to me in dreams. Like I know that if you come with me we will be safe."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon burst through the study door with sword in hand, followed by mages loudly claiming there was nothing threatening the guild. Devon raced across the room, yelling for Thessa to get back but she didnt listen. Instead she channeled a pulse of arcane energy into the room to disrupt any defensive spells Hemah may have active. The mages stopped in alarm as Hemahs invisibility spell dropped and the masked figure popped into view.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon ducked under Hemahs arm and sliced up along his ribs. Hemah screamed in pain and visions of a sleeping god danced briefly in front of his eyes, in a distant place that god stirred. Thessa prepared another spell as Hemah fell to the floor.[PARAGRAPH:1]Looking up Hemah only said, "Forget," and the impact of the word on the room was dramatic and sudden. It was as if Hemah had never been there.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Why did you set off your ring?" Devon asked in exasperation.[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa stood confused, the mages behind Devon continued their objections to his rush into the guild and their claims that there wasn't any danger here.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I don't know," she answered, "I'm sorry it was an accident."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon took a deep breath and sheathed his sword. After a few minutes of apologizing to the mages they finally left him alone with Thessa. She pulled a golden feather out of her hair and stared at it in confusion.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Are you okay?" Devon asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]He sat down and wrapped his arms around her, kissing her lightly on the cheek. She relaxed in his arms.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Did you find anything?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No," Thessa answered, "not yet."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Have you decided on a day for our wedding yet?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa smiled, she wasn't accustomed to pushing off decisions. But she hadn't been able to pick a day yet.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Soon, I promise."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah watched Thessa and Devon leave the mage guild late that night. Devon held her as they walked and despite the corruption approaching the city they were enjoying the time they had together. Hemah dumped his incense onto the street, he was no longer afraid of the dreams.[PARAGRAPH:1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_5]Chapter 5: Beltane Cycle[\LINK]</English>
		<French>[LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_1]Chapter 1: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_2]Chapter 2: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_3]Chapter 3: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE]Chapter 4: Beltane Cycle[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although it wasn't uncommon for disciples to miss the evening bell during Beltane, and not unheard of to still be missing the next morning, it was out of character for the bookish disciple Wyren. He had been the least interested in the festival and outside of his religious obligations hadn't attended many of the games or displays that crowded the elven capital.[PARAGRAPH:1]Priest Tuathal watched the flowerbed in concern. The flowers that each bloomed during different parts of the day, arrayed in an arc in order as they bloomed. Numbers marked each section and allowed the flowerbed to function as a large living clock as it was easy to tell the time by looking at the flowers that were in bloom. It was nearly noon and Wyren was still missing.[PARAGRAPH:1]A squirrel chattered loudly above the priest, hoping he may have some treats. Tuathal scowled back, unhappy to see the animal expecting to be fed rather than gathering the food from the forest himself. But the squirrel wouldn't give up and followed the priest from tree to tree as he walked into the grove between the three temples.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tuathal quietly prayed for some guidance. He couldn't help but feel that something bad had happened to Wyren even if everything else seemed normal. Unhappy at being ignored the squirrel climbed out on the branch closest to Tuathal and then jumped from there onto the satyr statue at the center of the grove. But instead of landing gracefully on the satyr's broad arm the squirrel passed completely through the statue and landed with a confused thud on the ground.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tuathal stared in surprise at the squirrel and the statue he had just jumped through. Pulling an acorn from his pocket he scooped the squirrel up onto his shoulder and gave him the nut while studying the statue. The squirrel studied it suspiciously as well.[PARAGRAPH:1]Slowly reaching out Tuathal's hand passed effortlessly through the statue; it was only an illusion. The real statue was gone.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hemah watched as the grove filled up with priests, city watch, and mages investigating the missing statue. He wasn't worried about being noticed, as a significant crowd of curious travelers, disciples and adepts had turned up to watch what was going on.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon, an elven man with golden hair and green eyes was leading the investigation. He wore the garb of a watch captain but it was obvious from his bearing that he was nobility as well. The captain checked out the statue himself and then after conferring with a shrugging group of mages ordered someone to get Thessa. Hemah leaned forward in interest, this was the first time he had heard her name but he suspected he already knew who she was.[PARAGRAPH:1]While he waited the captain investigated the rest of the grove, ordering people back. He found wagon tracks leading into the grove, and the heavier set leading out. They lead back out to one of the busiest roads in Evermore, where they were impossible to track. But he sent a group of soldiers down the road anyway to see what they could find. He asked another to start questioning the local wagoneers to see if anyone had stored or purchased a wagon capable of carrying a marble statue in the past few days. The day after Beltane there were hundreds of wagons in Evermore that fit that description, but the lieutenant accepted his charge and set off to perform it.[PARAGRAPH:1]Shortly afterwards a beautiful archmage entered the grove and the theorizing mages grew quiet. She talked quietly with the captain, asked a few questions to the mages, who shrugged again, and then went over and knelt down by the statue.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Is the statue of anyone in particular?" she asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]Priest Tuathal scowled but controlled himself before responding, "Surely your studies keep you too long from the temple lady Thessa. The statue is of Gower, favored son of Cernunnos, who was killed by Agares during the first Age. This statue was erected by the elves of that age in memory of him. It is one of the oldest relics in Evermore."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thieves usually aren't that interested in history and there are a thousand statues in Evermore that would have been easier to steal. Is there any reason why this one would be more valuable?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The priest cleared his throat. The eyes of everyone in the grove went to him and the squirrel on his shoulder glared back at everyone.[PARAGRAPH:1]After an awkward silence Tuathal said, "we may need to talk about that in private."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon ordered one of his guards to have the priest taken into the temple for a more private conversation. But Thessa ignored the response, to her it was just another example of how the traditions of the Ljosalfar were keeping it from moving ahead. Taking a deep breath she closed her eyes and began to cast.[PARAGRAPH:1]If she was beautiful, she was even more beautiful while in the throes of magic. Her dark hair, unusual among the Ljosalfar, fluttered and her body strained as she channeled the power needed to cast the spell. Hemah recognized it, she would be trying to follow the link between the illusion and the one maintaining it. She was trying to find him. But just before her spell was completed Hemah released the illusion and the statue disappeared.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What happened, did you dispel it?" Devon asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]With the object of her spell gone Thessa struggled to release the magic harmlessly. Her hands glowed as if stars danced from them and then faded out.[PARAGRAPH:1]"No," Thessa answered, "I hadn't done anything yet. The caster released the spell before I could follow it back to him."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon looked up at the assembled group of spectators, who dumbly returned his gaze. He turned to the last of his lieutenants.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Have everyone here be brought to the barracks for questioning."[PARAGRAPH:1]A few hours later Hemah was still sitting in the barracks waiting to be questioned. All of the citizens of Evermore had been first, and questioning them went relatively quickly. But they were taking their time with the travelers. Hemah had already released the spell he cast on Alazkan's amulet, he hoped it hid him for long enough. And unlike most mages he didn't keep anything magical on him. He was less concerned with the questioning then he was in making sure he got the right questioner.[PARAGRAPH:1]Fortunately Thessa was in charge of examining all the travelers and just after nightfall his name was called and he was shuffled into a small office with her. Thessa looked over the notes a soldier had collected on the group and the items they had taken from Hemah.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Are these yours?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes," Hemah answered.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What are you doing in Evermore?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I came for the festival." Hemah said somewhat honestly.[PARAGRAPH:1]"A common answer today, do you worship Cernunnos?" Thessa asked the questions as a matter of protocol, she was more interested in looking through the items he had. She had the golden feather, mask and bag of incense laid out on the table and she was carefully examining the feather.[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, I'm not really religious. Though I do enjoy the sights of Evermore and the festival."[PARAGRAPH:1]This was the first time Thessa looked up at him, most of the people she talked to today claimed to be worshipers even if they weren't. He had a gentle face, almost soft and would be handsome if he didn't look so tired. He didn't match what she would expect from a merchant, mage or one of the many people that flocked to Evermore for the festival.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What of these items?" she asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The mask is for the festival," Hemah lied, he wore the mask to keep him from seeing his own reflection. That helped keep him from dreaming about himself, which was an exhilarating and terrifying experience.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The feather I found on the edges of your empire. I've only had it for a few days and I'm not sure what to make of it."[PARAGRAPH:1]"It is beautiful." Thessa was more practical than most of the Ljosalfar, and had never seen much value in spiritual or artistic matters but she couldn't deny the draw of the feather. She tested it several times before Hemah came into the room and it was the reason she wanted to question him directly. It wasn't magical, but she couldn't believe the draw it had without magical means.[PARAGRAPH:1]"It's the second most beautiful thing I've seen in your lands."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah's meaning was obvious from the way he was looking at her, but Thessa pretended to miss the compliment.[PARAGRAPH:1]"And the incense?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"It helps me sleep." Hemah honestly responded, "I have troubling dreams sometimes, but if I burn the incense in the room with me I don't have them."[PARAGRAPH:1]"This is an ancient elven craft, I'm surprised to see anyone with it, especially a human. Did you buy it from someone at the festival?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, I met a merchant in Kingsport with it. But I don't know how he got it."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah paused before continuing.[PARAGRAPH:1]"About the feather... I'd like you to have it."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa looked surprised and suspicious so Hemah continued.[PARAGRAPH:1]"As I said, I found it at the edge of your empire, so if anything it is yours anyway. It is too beautiful to be stuffed into my tunic for months on end."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa would never accept a gift from someone being investigated. The fact that he was offering a gift implied his guilt. But she couldn't help feeling that this was different, that this man was lonely and out of place, but not responsible for the disappearance of the statue or disciple Wyren. And she found herself unable to turn down the feather.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Are you sure? This won't affect the investigation at all. You will still likely spend the night in jail."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah nodded, "I'm sure."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa tucked the feather in her dark hair and smiled at him. That vision was forever burned into Hemah's heart and it was all he could do to keep from professing his eternal love for her. Then she leaned across, kissed him gently on the cheek, whispered her thanks and left the room. He was left stunned.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon was watching the interview. There were only a handful of suspects that seemed out of place. Though he suspected they were all dead ends. But seeing Thessa kiss the pale human caused a turmoil of emotions that he was unable to understand.[PARAGRAPH:1]When she came out of the room they met to discuss the results of the interviews. Thessa didn't know he had seen the kiss but sensed immediately that he was distant. As they went through each of the suspects they easily agreed to hold or release each of them until they came to Hemah.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Do you think he is a mage without magic, a kidnapper without a victim, an attacker without a weapon and a thief without the goods? We found the wagoneer that sold the missing wagon, the man he described doesn't match any of our suspects. What is it you suspect about this one?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon was unaccustomed to being so directly questioned from anyone except Thessa, it was one of the things that he loved about her. She was right, but even without the kiss there was something about Hemah that bothered him. Devon's father was an angel in Sucellus's charge and that divine birthright usually made his instincts correct.[PARAGRAPH:1]Unable to settle the dispute they asked priest Tuathal's opinion. He peeked into the room where Hemah sat quietly and considered him. After a few minutes he simply said, "I agree with Devon, there is something suspicious about the man that warrants more scrutiny. I would have him held until we find out more."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon gave the order before Thessa could object. Then Tuathal stepped in to cool the stubborn archmage's temper.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I heard that Devon proposed to you at the festival dance last night. I am sorry it took me so long to congratulate your betrothal."[PARAGRAPH:1]Tuathal's tactic worked and Thessa let her argument go in the face of the priest's good wishes.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, it was an amazing night. I couldn't be happier."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon was also relaxed by the memories of the previous night, "Now we have only to set a day."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa smiled, Hemah's plight was forgotten.[PARAGRAPH:1]A few minutes later guards came and told Hemah he was to be held for further questioning. They led him to a cell where he was locked up with a few pickpockets and a handful of others that were suspected of having something to do with the theft. He went peacefully to the cell, and only argued that he needed his incense so he could sleep. They refused to give it to him and ignored his requests.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah stayed up for most of the night but as the hours went by he found himself drifting off in short bursts. The sleep from the incense wasn't that restful so it had been weeks since he had really slept. In his short bursts of dreams he saw visions of Thessa, the satyr statue, the golden feather as part of the wings of an ancient god, and that god's attack on this very forest. Visions of withered trees and disease.[PARAGRAPH:1]He shook himself awake. These dreams were horrible but he was so tired that he was falling asleep even as he paced back and forth. Eventually the dreams won.[PARAGRAPH:1]When he awoke the barracks was full of concerned guards, mages and priests. Devon was organizing the efforts and getting reports from scouts checking in from various edges of the forest. After a few hours the guards remembered the travelers they had detained and, seeing no opportunity to pursue the investigation and little hope of finding anything if they did, opened the cell and let them go.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah had his mask, incense and other items returned and he was released onto the streets of Evermore. Devon excused himself from his meeting and caught up with Hemah as he walked away from the barracks.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You, where are you going?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah couldn't believe he was going to go through this again.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The guards released me, they said the investigation was suspended."[PARAGRAPH:1]"I know," Devon responded. "I mean you will be leaving Evermore. You will be leaving our forest. You won't return."[PARAGRAPH:1]The captain looked angry and Hemah noticed that the other suspects that had been released weren't given the same speech.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I was hoping to talk to the woman who questioned me before I left. Do you know where she is?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The captain's eyes narrowed, Hemah had found the point of the captain's anger at him and immediately regretted asking the question.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Her name is Thessa, and she is betrothed to me. You will not talk to her."[PARAGRAPH:1]At that Devon called a guard over and ordered him to escort Hemah to the edge of the forest. The guard agreed and with a final glare from Devon Hemah was led away from the barracks.[PARAGRAPH:1]As Hemah walked beside the guard he put on his mask. He was an amazing caster and could cast minor spells simply from sheer strength of will. Especially after the prior night's sleep, he felt more rested than he had in months. As he walked he reached out to the guard's mind. He would travel out to the forests edge alone, all the while believing Hemah walked beside him and left without any problems.[PARAGRAPH:1]After the spell was firmly in place Hemah cut down an alleyway and headed to the mage guild of the city, where he guessed Thessa would be searching for a cause of the corruption that occurred last night.[PARAGRAPH:1]There were three ways to become invisible. Bend light around your body, create an illusion on your body of the surface behind it or simply trick the mind of the person looking at you so that they don't think they see you. It was this last form that Hemah used as he walked into the mage guild. He scanned ahead, finding elves and blocking their mind to his presence. Technically everyone he walked by saw him as he wandered through the hallways and studies of the guild, but they didn't realize it.[PARAGRAPH:1]He didn't try to include Thessa in the spell. She was looking through piles of ancient tomes when he entered the room. She still had the golden feather in her hair.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thessa."[PARAGRAPH:1]She didn't recognize the voice and it took her a second to match the mask with the one she examined the day before. He had a commanding presence and she could feel the magic radiating from him. This figure was much different than the lonely young man she interviewed and a quick touch of her ring warned Devon that she was in danger.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hemah? What are you doing here?"[PARAGRAPH:1]She reached out and felt the magic flowing through the room, mentally preparing to defend herself against a mental or physical assault. Without thinking she pushed the tomes aside to keep them from getting damaged.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I came for you, this blight consumes hope. It will destroy you or Evermore. You must get out of here."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Did you create it?" What she had seen of the corruption growing in the forest was beyond anything she had seen before. She sensed a lot of power in Hemah, but the corruption was something greater.[PARAGRAPH:1]"No," Hemah replied. "You did. It's a memory of an affliction that struck the forest long ago. It was eventually stopped by an angel, but no such angel exists to stop it now. Come with me."[PARAGRAPH:1]"How do you know about the source of the corruption?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah could feel her gathering power. She was planning to attack him but she wanted to see what she could learn from him first.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thessa, I don't know the answer to that, things are revealed to me in dreams. Like I know that if you come with me we will be safe."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon burst through the study door with sword in hand, followed by mages loudly claiming there was nothing threatening the guild. Devon raced across the room, yelling for Thessa to get back but she didnt listen. Instead she channeled a pulse of arcane energy into the room to disrupt any defensive spells Hemah may have active. The mages stopped in alarm as Hemahs invisibility spell dropped and the masked figure popped into view.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon ducked under Hemahs arm and sliced up along his ribs. Hemah screamed in pain and visions of a sleeping god danced briefly in front of his eyes, in a distant place that god stirred. Thessa prepared another spell as Hemah fell to the floor.[PARAGRAPH:1]Looking up Hemah only said, "Forget," and the impact of the word on the room was dramatic and sudden. It was as if Hemah had never been there.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Why did you set off your ring?" Devon asked in exasperation.[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa stood confused, the mages behind Devon continued their objections to his rush into the guild and their claims that there wasn't any danger here.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I don't know," she answered, "I'm sorry it was an accident."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon took a deep breath and sheathed his sword. After a few minutes of apologizing to the mages they finally left him alone with Thessa. She pulled a golden feather out of her hair and stared at it in confusion.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Are you okay?" Devon asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]He sat down and wrapped his arms around her, kissing her lightly on the cheek. She relaxed in his arms.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Did you find anything?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No," Thessa answered, "not yet."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Have you decided on a day for our wedding yet?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa smiled, she wasn't accustomed to pushing off decisions. But she hadn't been able to pick a day yet.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Soon, I promise."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah watched Thessa and Devon leave the mage guild late that night. Devon held her as they walked and despite the corruption approaching the city they were enjoying the time they had together. Hemah dumped his incense onto the street, he was no longer afraid of the dreams.[PARAGRAPH:1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_5]Chapter 5: Beltane Cycle[\LINK]</French>

Er war einer der am wenigsten an dem Fest Interessierten und außerhalb seiner religiösen Pflichten hatte er an kaum einem Spiel oder Feier in der elfischen Hauptstadt teilgenommen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Priester Tuathal beobachtete besorgt das Blumenbeet. Die Blumen, die jeweils zu verschiedenen Tageszeiten blühten, waren in einem Bogen, in der Reihenfolge ihrer Blütezeit, angeordnet. Nummern markierten jede Sektion des Bogens, sodass das Blumenbeet als Uhr dienen konnte und man einfach die Uhrzeit ablesen konnte, indem man darauf achtete, welche Blume gerade blühte. Es war fast Mittag und Wyren wurden noch immer vermisst.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ein Eichhörnchen schnatterte laut über dem Priester, in der Hoffnung er habe ein paar Leckereien. Tuathal starrte finster zurück, unzufrieden darüber, dass das Tier eher erwartete gefüttert zu werden, anstatt sich sein Futter selbst aus dem Wald zu suchen. Aber das Eichhörnchen gab nicht auf und folgte dem Priester von Baum zu Baum, während dieser zu dem Hain zwischen den drei Tempeln ging.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tuathal betete lautlos um ein wenig Beistand und Führung. Er konnte sich nicht helfen, er fühlte, dass etwas schlimmes mit Wyren geschehen war, auch wenn alles andere sehr normal erschien. Unglücklich über die Tatsache, dass es ignoriert wurde, kletterte das Eichhörnchen über einen Ast, der in der Nähe von Tuathal hing, und sprang von dort auf die Statue eines Satyrs, die in der Mitte des Hains stand. Doch anstelle einer anmutigen Landung auf dem breiten Arm des Satyrs, glitt das Eichhörnchen durch den Arm und die gesamte Statue hindurch und landete mit einem Plumps auf dem Boden[PARAGRAPH:1]Tuathal starrte das Eichhörnchen und die Statue überrascht an. Er kramte eine Eichel aus seiner Tasche, lockte das Eichhörnchen auf seine Schulter und gab ihm die Nuss, während er die Statue musterte. Das Eichhörnche musterte sie ebenfalls misstrauisch.[PARAGRAPH:1]Langsam streckte er seine Hand aus und sie ging widerstandslos durch die Statue hindurch, es war lediglich eine Illusion. Die echte Statue war fort.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hemah beobachtete, wie sich der Hain mit Priester, Wachleuten und Magier füllte, die alle das Verschwinden der Statue untersuchten. Er befürchtete nicht entdeckt zu werden, da sich bereits eine große Traube aus Reisenden, jungen Geweihten und Adepten versammelt hatte, um zu sehen was hier geschah.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon, ein elfischer Mann mit goldenem Haar und grünen Augen führte die Untersuchung an. Er trug das Abzeichen eines Wachhauptmanns, aber es war an seiner Haltung zu erkennen, dass er einer der Noblen war. Der Hauptmann überprüfte die Statue selber und gab, nachdem er sich mit einer Gruppe achselzuckender Magier beraten hatte, den Befehl, Thessa zu holen. Hemah lehte sich interessiert vor, es war das erste Mal, dass er ihren Namen hörte, aber er nahm an, dass er bereits wusste, wer sie war.[PARAGRAPH:1]Während der Hauptmann wartete nahm er den Rest des Hains in Augenschein und wies die leute an, zurückzuweichen. Er fand Wagenspuren, ein Paar in den Hain hinein und ein tieferes Paar aus dem Hain heraus. Sie führten auf die belebteste Straße Evermores, sodass es unmöglich war sie weiter zu verfolgen, aber er sandte trotzdem eine Gruppe Soldaten aus, die die Straße hinab nachsehen sollten, ob sie etwas fänden. Er befahl außerdem einem anderen eine Befragung der örtlichen Wagenlenker zu starten, ob in den letzten Tagen jemand einen Wagen gemietet oder gekauft habe, der in der Lage wäre eine solche Statue zu transportieren. Am Tag nach Beltane gab es in Evermore hunderte Wagen, auf die diese Beschreibung passen würde, aber der Leutnant akzeptierte seine Aufgabe und zog los, sie zu erfüllen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Kurze Zeit später betrat eine wunderhübsche Erzmagierin den Hain und die diskutierenden magier verstummten. Sie sprach leise mit dem Hauptmann, stellte den Magiern ein paar Fragen, welche wie immer nur die Schultern zuckten, und wandte sich dann um und kniete vor der Statue nieder.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Stellt die Statue jemand besonderes dar?" fragte sie.[PARAGRAPH:1]Priester Tuathals Blick verfinsterte sich, aber er bekam sich unter Kontrolle, bevor er antwortete, "Sicherlich halten euch Eure Studien davon ab, öfter in den Tempel zu kommen, Lady Thessa. Die Statue stellt Gower dar, den Lieblingssohn von Cernunnos, der von Agares im ersten Zeitalter getötet wurde. Diese Statue wurden von den Elfen dieser Zeit geschaffen, um seiner zu Gedenken. Sie ist eines der ältesten Relikte in Evermore."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Normalerweise interessieren sich Diebe nicht allzu sehr für Geschichte und außerdem gibt es in Evermore tausende Statuen, die leichter zu stehlen wären. Gibt es also einen besonderen Grund, der diese Statue besonders wertvoll macht?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Priester schluckte schwer. Die Augen eines jeden in diesem Hain lagen auf ihm und das Eichhörnchen auf seiner Schulter starrten zurück.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nach einer unangenehmen Stille entgegnete Tuathal: "Wir sollten nicht in der Öffentlichkeit darüber sprechen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon befahl einer seiner Wachen, den Priester für eine privatere Unterhaltung in den Tempel zu bringen. Aber Thessa ignorierte die Reaktionen, für sie war das ganze nur ein weiteres Beispiel dafür, wie die Traditionen die Ljosalfar davon abhielten, sich weiterzuentwickeln. Sie atmete tief ein und begann einen Spruch vorzubereiten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sie war so schon wunderschön, aber noch schöner war sie, wenn sie zauberte. Ihr schwarzes Haar, unüblich bei den Ljosalfar, wogte hin und her und ihr Körper spannte sich an, als sie die magische Macht kanalisierte, die für den Zauberspruch nötig war. Hemah nahm war, dass sie versuchen würde, die Verbindung zwischen der Illusion und demjenigen, der sie aufrecht erhielt, zurückzuverfolgen. Sie versuchte ihn zu finden. Aber kurz bevor ihr Spruch fertig war löste Hemah die Illusion und die Statue verschwand.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Was ist geschehen, hast du den Zauber gebrochen?" fragte Devon.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nachdem das Zielobjekt ihres Spruches verschwunden war, musste Thessa versuchen, die magische Energie harmlos zu kanalisieren. Ihre Hände leuchteten, als ob Sterne um sie herum tanzen würden, und verblassten schließlich.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Nein," antwortete Thessa, "Ich habe nichts getan. Der Spruchwirker hat die Illusion gelöst, bevor ich sie zu ihm zurückverfolgen konnte."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon blickte zu der zusammengewürfelten Menge von Schaulustigen hinüber, die seinen Blick stumpf erwiderten. Er wandte sich seinem letzten Leutnant zu.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Lasst jeden hier, für eine weitergehende Befragung, zur Kaserne bringen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Ein paar Stunden später saß Hemah noch immer in der Kaserne und wartete auf seine Befragung. Alle Bürger Evermores waren bereits befragt worden und diese Befragungen waren schnell über die Bühne gegangen. Aber mit den Reisenden ließen sie sich Zeit. Hemah hatte bereits den Spruch, der auf Alazkans Amulett lag, gelöst und hoffte, dass er ihn lange genug geschützt habe. Und anders als die meisten Magier trug er nichts magisches bei sich. Er machte sich weniger Gedanken über die Befragung selber, als darüber, den richtigen Fragensteller zu bekommen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Glücklicherweise war Thessa im Dienst und hatte die Aufgabe die Reisenden zu befragen und kurz nach Einbruch der Nacht wurde sein Name aufgerufen und er in ein kleines Büro mit Thessa gebracht. Thessa überflog ein paar Notizen, die ein Soldat über die Gruppe angelegt hatte, und besah sich die Gegenstände, die Hemah abgenommen worden waren.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sind dies Eure Habseligkeiten?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ja" antwortete Hemah.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Was führte Euch nach Evermore?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich kam wegen des Festes her." antwortete Hemah irgendwie ehrlich.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Eine typische Antwort heute, glaubt ihr an Cernunnos?" Thessa stellte diese Fragen nach Protokoll, sie interessierte sich vielmehr für die Gegenstände, die ihm gehörten. Sie hatte die Feder, die Maske und den Beutel mit dem Pulver vor sich auf dem Tisch liegen und untersuchte die Feder vorsichtig.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Nein, ich bin nicht religiös. Aber ich habe die Sehenswürdigkeiten Evermores und das Fest genossen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Das war das erste Mal, dass Thessa zu ihm aufsah, die meisten Leute hatten behauptet Gläubige zu sein, selbst wenn sie es nicht waren. Er hatte ein freundliches Gesicht, recht sanft und würde ganz attraktiv aussehen, wenn er nicht so offenkundig übermüdet wäre. Er sah nicht so aus wie, sich einen Händler, einen Magier, oder sonstwen, der nur für das Fest gekommen war, vorstellte.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Was ist mit diesen Gegenständen?" fragte sie ihn.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Die Maske ist für das Fest," log Hemah, er trug die Maske, um sein eigenes Spiegelbild nicht sehen zu müssen. Es half ihm, nicht von sich selbst zu träumen, was ein berauschendes aber auch erschreckendes Erlebnis war.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Die Feder fand ich am Rand eures Reiches. Ich besitze sie erst seit ein paar Tagen und weiß noch nicht, was ich damit machen soll."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sie ist wunderschön." Thessa war stärker praktisch veranlagt als die meisten Ljosalfar und hatte nie viel Wert in spirituellen oder künstlerischen Dingen gesehen, aber sie konnte die Anziehungskraft dieser Feder nicht leugnen. Sie hatte sie mehrfach untersucht bevor Hemah in das Zimmer gebracht worden war und das war der Grund, warum sie ihn persönlich befragen wollte. Sie war nicht magisch, aber sie konnte nicht glauben, dass sie diese unglaubliche Anziehungskraft besitzen könne, ohne magisch zu sein.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sie ist das zweitschönste, das ich in euren Ländern zu sehen bekam."[PARAGRAPH:1]Was Hemah damit meinte war, wegen des Blickes den er ihr zuwarf, klar, aber Thessa entschied sich, das Kompliment zu überhören.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Und das Pulver?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Es hilft mir zu schlafen." gab Hemah ehrlich zu, "Ich habe manchmal sehr unangenehme Träume, aber wenn ich dieses Pulver in dem Raum verbrenne in den ich schlafe, dann habe ich keine Träume."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Das ist ein altes elfisches Rezept, ich bin überrascht überhaupt jemanden damit anzutreffen, ganz besonders einen Menschen. Habt ihr es von jemandem auf dem Fest gekauft?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Nein, ich habe in Kingsport einen Händler getroffen, der es besaß. Aber ich weiß nicht, wie er an es gelangt ist."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah legte eine Pause ein, bevor er fortfuhr.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Wegen der Feder... Ich möchte, dass ihr sie habt."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa sah ihn überrascht und misstrauisch an.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Wie ich bereits sagte, ich fand sie am Rand Eures Reiches, also sollte sie Euch gehören. Sie ist viel zu schön, als dass sie für eventuell Monate in meinem Mantel stecken sollte."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa würde niemals ein Geschenk von jemandem akzeptieren, der gerade befragt wurde. Die Tatsache, dass er ein Geschenk anbot, bewies quasi seine Schuld. Aber sie konnte sich nicht helfen, sie fühlte das dies hier anders war, das dieser Mann einsam und fehl am Platze war, aber nicht verantwortlich für das Verschwinden der Statue und des Geweihten Wyren. Und sie war auch nicht in der Lage, die Feder wieder abzugeben.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Seid Ihr sicher, dies würde die Untersuchung in keinster Weise beeinflussen. Ihr werdet trotzdem die Nacht im Gefägnis verbringen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah nickte, "Ich bin sicher."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa steckte sich die Feder in ihr schwarzes Haar und lächelte ihn an. Dieser Anblick war nun für immer in Hemahs Herz eingebrannt und es war das einzige was er tun konnte, um ihr nicht sofort seine ewige Liebe zu gestehen. Dann lehnte sie sich vor, küsste ihn sanft auf die Wange, flüsterte ihm ihren Dank zu und verließ den Raum. Er blieb wie betäubt zurück.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon hatte die Unterredung beobachtet. Es hatte ein paar Verdächtige gegeben, die fehl am Platz wirkten. Trotzdem nahm er an, dass es alles Sackgassen waren. Aber zu sehen, wie Thessa diesen fahlen Menschen küsste, ließ eine Gefühlswallung in ihm aufsteigen, die er nicht verstand.[PARAGRAPH:1]Als sie aus dem Zimmer kam trafen sie sich, um über die Ergebnisse der Befragungen zu diskutieren. Thessa wusste nicht, dass er den Kuss gesehen hatte, aber nahm sofort war, dass er irgendwie distanziert wirkte. Als sie nach und nach alle Verdächtigen durchsprachen waren sie sich immer schnell einig, ob sie sie festhalten oder gehen lassen sollten. Bis sie zu Hemah kamen.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Glaubst du er ist ein Magier ohne Magie, ein Entführer ohne Opfer, ein Angreifer ohne Waffe und ein Dieb ohne Diebesgut? Wir fanden den Wagenlenker, der den fraglichen Wagen verkaufte, der Mann den er beschrieben hat ist keiner von unseren Verdächtigen. Was ist Eure Verdächtigung bei diesem?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon war es nicht gewohnt so direkt gefragt zu werden, außer von Thessa, es war eines der Dinge weshalb er sie liebte. Sie hatte Recht, aber auch ohne den Kuss war da etwas, dass ihn an Hemah störte. Devons war einer von Sucellus' Engeln und seine Blutlinie sorgte meist dafür, dass seine Instinkte richtig lagen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nicht in der Lage diesen Disput beizulegen, fragten sie Priester Tuathal nach seiner Meinung. Er warf einen Blick in den Raum in dem Hemah still saß und bildete sich eine Meinung. Nach ein paar Minuten sagte er nur, "Ich stimme Devon zu, es ist etwas an diesem Mann, das eine eingehende Untersuchung erforderlich macht. Ich würde ihn festhalten bis wir mehr wissen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon gab den Befehl noch bevor Thessa widersprechen konnte. Dann griff Tuathal ein, das Gemüt der temperamentvollen Erzmagierin zu besänftigen.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich hörte, dass Devon euch beim letzten Tanz auf dem Beltanefest einen Antrag gemacht hat. Ich muss mich entschuldigen, dass es so lange gedauert hat, bis ich Euch zu Eurer Verlobung gratulieren konnte."[PARAGRAPH:1]Tuathals Taktik ging auf und Thessa schluckte ihre Antwort im Angesicht der guten Wünsche des Priesters herunter.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ja, es war eine unglaubliche Nacht. Ich könnte nicht glücklicher sein."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon entspannte sich wegen der schönen Erinnerung an die Nacht ebenfalls, "Nun müssen wir nur noch einen Tag bestimmen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa lächelte, Hemahs war vergessen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ein paar Minuten später kamen ein paar Wachen und teilten Hemah mit, dass er für weitere Befragungen festgehalten werden würde. Sie brachten ihn in eine Zelle, wo er mit ein paar Taschendieben und einer Handvoll anderer, die ebenfalls verdächtigt wurden etwas mit dem Diebstahl zu tun zu haben, eingesperrt wurde. Er ging friedlich zu der Zelle und wand lediglich ein, dass er sein Pulver brauchen würde um schlafen zu können. Sie lehnte es ab es ihm zu geben und ignorierten seine Bitten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah blieb den größten Teil der Nacht wach, aber während die Stunden verstrichen bemerkte er, wie er immer wieder für kurze Momente einnickte. Der Schlaf durch das Pulver war nicht sehr erholsam und so war es schon einige Wochen her, seit er das letzte mal wirklich gut geschlafen hatte. In diesen kurzen, blitzartigen Träumen sah er Visionen von Thessa, der Satyrstatue, der goldenen Feder als Teil der Flügel eines alten Gottes und des Angriffes dieses Gottes auf diesen Wald. Visionen abgestorbener Bäume und Krankheiten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Er schreckte hoch. Diese Träume waren wirklich schrecklich, aber er war so müde, dass er trotzdem einschlief, obwohl er auf und ab ging. Schließlich gewannen die Träume.[PARAGRAPH:1]Als er erwachte war die Kaserne voller besorgter Wachen, Magier und Priester. Devon koordinierte die Bemühungen und Empfing Berichte von Spähern aus allen Ecken des Reiches. Nach ein paar Stunden erinnerten sich die Wachen an die eingekerkerten Reisenden und, da sie keine Chance sahen mit den Untersuchungen fortzufahren oder etwas zu finden wenn sie es täten, öffneten die Zellentür und ließen sie gehen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah bekam seine Maske, das Pulver und andere Habseligkeiten zurück und wurde auf Evermores Straßen entlassen. Devon entschuldigte sich in seiner Besprechung und passte Hemah ab, als dieser sich von der Kaserne entfernte.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ihr, wo geht Ihr hin?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah konnte nicht glauben, dass er wieder das gleiche Spiel durchmachen würde.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Die Wachen haben mich freigelassen, sie sagten die Untersuchung wäre gestrichen."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich weiß," entgegnete Devon, "ich meinte damit, dass ihr Evermore verlassen sollt. Ihr werdet unseren Wald verlassen. Ihr werdet nie zurück kehren."[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Hauptmann sah wütend aus und Hemah bemerkte, dass die anderen freigelassenen Verdächtigen diese Ansprache nicht bekommen hatten.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich hatte gehofft noch einmal mit der Frau, die mich befragt hat, sprechen zu können bevor ich gehe. Wisst Ihr wo sie sich aufhält?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Augen des Hauptmanns verengten sich, Hemah wusste sofort warum der Hauptmann wütend auf ihn war und bedauerte sofort, dass er gefragt hatte.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ihr Name ist Thessa und sie ist mit mir verlobt. Ihr werdet nicht mit ihr sprechen."[PARAGRAPH:1]Dann rief Devon eine Wache herbei und befahl ihr, Hemah bis zur Grenze des Waldes zu eskortieren und mit einem letzten Blick vom Hauptmann wurde Hemah von der Kaserne fortgebracht.[PARAGRAPH:1]Während Hemah neben der Wache herlief setzte er seine Maske auf. Er war ein sehr fähiger Zauberer und konnte einfache Sprüche einfach durch seine Willenskraft wirken. Vor allem nach dem Schlaf letzte Nacht fühlte er sich ausgeruhter als jemals sonst in den letzten Monaten. Während er weiterging tastete er nach dem Geist des Wächters. Er würde alleine zum Rand des Waldes wandern, aber annehmen Hemah würde neben ihm laufen und den Wald ohne Probleme verlassen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nachdem der Spruch gewirkt war schlug sich Hemah in eine Seitengassen und machte sich auf den Weg zur Magiergilde der Stadt, von der er annahm, dass Thessa dort sein würde um nach einer Lösung für die Korruption zu suchen, die seit letzter Nacht in Wald um sich griff.[PARAGRAPH:1]Es gibt drei Wege um unsichtbar zu werden. Licht um seinen Körper herum beugen, eine Illusion der Umgebung auf den eigenen Körper wirken oder einfach den Geist einer Person, die einen ansieht, täuschen, sodass sie meint, man wäre garnicht da. Es war diese letzte Form die Hemah verwendete als er die Gilde betrat. Er tastete die Umgebung ab, fand Elfen und blockierte ihren Geist für seine Anwesenheit. Technisch gesehen sah ihn jeder, wie er in den Gängen der Gilde herumlief und sie erkundete, aber keiner nahm es wirklich wahr.[PARAGRAPH:1]Er versuchte nicht Thessa in diesen Spruch miteinzubeziehen. Sie durchforstete Berge von alten Wälzern als er den Raum betrat. Sie trug noch immer die goldene Feder in ihrem Haar.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thessa."[PARAGRAPH:1]Sie erinnerte sich nicht an die Stimme und es dauerte einen Moment, bis sie die Person hinter der Maske mit der in der Verbindung brachte, die sie Gestern befragt hatte. Er hatte eine Aura der Autorität um sich und sie konnte die Magie fühlen, die er verströmte. Diese Person war eine ganz anderen, als der einsame junge Mann den sie gestern befragt hatte und eine kurze Berührung ihres Ringes setzte Devon davon in Kenntnis, dass sie in Gefahr war.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hemah? Was tut Ihr hier?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Sie erweiterte ihren Geist und spürte die Magie, die durch den Raum wallte und bereitete sich unverzüglich darauf vor sich gegen eine mentale oder physische Attacke zu wehren. Ohne nachzudenken schob sie die Bücher beiseite um sie vor Schaden zu schützen.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich kam wegen Euch, diese Pest verschlingt Hoffnung. Sie wird Euch oder Evermore zerstören. Ihr müsst von hier verschwinden."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Habt ihr sie erschaffen?" Alles was sie von der Pest, die im Wald um sich griff, gesehen hatte, war mehr als sie je zuvor zu Gesicht bekommen hatte. Sie erkannte eine Menge Macht in Hemah, aber diese Seuche war noch etwas viel Größeres.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Nein," erwiderte Hemah "Ihr tatet es. Es ist die Erinnerung an ein altes Leid, das diesen Wald einst befallen hatte. Es wurde damals von einem Engel aufgehalten, aber heutzutage gibt es keinen solchen Engel mehr um es aufzuhalten. Kommt mit mir."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Wie habt ihr von der Quelle der Korruption erfahren?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah konnte ihre wachsende Macht spüren. Sie bereitete sich darauf vor ihn anzugreifen, aber wollte zunächst sehen, was sie vorher noch von ihm lernen könnte.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thessa, ich kenne die Antwort nicht, diese Dinge werden mir in Träumen enthüllt. So wie ich weiß, dass wir sicher sein werden, wenn Ihr mit mir kommt."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon brach durch die Tür, das Schwert in der Hand, gefolgt von Magiern die dauernd versicherten, dass nichts die Gilde bedrohe. Devon rannte durch den Raum, rief Thessa zu zurückzuweichen, aber Thessa hörte nicht. Stattdessen sandte sie einen Ausbruch magischer Energie durch den Raum, um jeden Verteidigungsspruch, den Hemah eventuell auf sich liegen haben könnte, zu brechen. Die Magier hielten alarmiert inne, als Hemahs Unsichtbarkeitsspruch schwand und plötzlich eine maskierte Gestalt in ihrem Sichtfeld auftauchte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon duckte sich unter Hemahs Arm hindurch und schnitt ihm entlang der Rippen ins Fleisch. Hemah schrie vor Schmerzen auf und die Vision von einem schlafenden Gott an einem fernen, verschwommenen Ort tauchten vor seinen Augen auf. Thessa bereitete einen weiteren Spruch vor, als Hemah zu Boden fiel.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nach oben blickend sprach Hemah nur ein Wort, "Vergessen!" und die Auswirkungen des Wortes auf den Raum waren dramatisch und augenblicklich. Es war so, als ob Hemah niemals dort gewesen wäre.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Warum hast du deinen Ring benutzt?" fragte Devon gefrustet.[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa sah verwirrt aus, die Magier hinter Devon begannen wieder mit ihren Klagen und das Eindringen in die Gilde und das es hier keine Gefahr gebe.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich weiß nicht," stammelte sie "Es tut mir Leid, es war ein Missgeschick."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon atmete tief ein und steckte sein Schwert zurück in die Scheide. Nach ein paar Minuten voller Entschuldigungen zu den Magiern ließen sie ihn und Thessa alleine. Sie zog sich eine goldene Feder aus dem Haar und starrte sie verwirrt an.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Bist du in Ordnung?" fragte Devon.[PARAGRAPH:1]Er setzte sich neben sie, legte ihr den Arm um die Schulter und küsste sie leicht auf die Wange. Sie entspannte sich in seinen Armen.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hast du irgendetwas herausgefunden?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Nein," gab Thessa zu, "bis jetzt nicht."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hast du schon einen Tag für unsere Hochzeit ausgewählt?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa lächelte, sie war nicht gewöhnt Entscheidungen vor sich her zu schieben, aber sie hatte bisher noch keine Zeit gehabt, darüber nachzudenken.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Bald, ich verspreche es."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah beobachtete Thessa und Devon, wie sie die Magiergilde spät in der Nacht verließen. Devon hielt sie im Arm während sie miteinander wanderten und trotz der zunehmenden Verseuchung genossen sie die Zeit, die sie miteinander verbrachten. Hemah streute sein Pulver auf die Straße, er fürchtete seine Träume nicht länger.[PARAGRAPH:1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_5]Kapitel 5: Der Beltanezyklus[\LINK]</German>
		<Italian>[LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_1]Chapter 1: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_2]Chapter 2: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_3]Chapter 3: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE]Chapter 4: Beltane Cycle[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although it wasn't uncommon for disciples to miss the evening bell during Beltane, and not unheard of to still be missing the next morning, it was out of character for the bookish disciple Wyren. He had been the least interested in the festival and outside of his religious obligations hadn't attended many of the games or displays that crowded the elven capital.[PARAGRAPH:1]Priest Tuathal watched the flowerbed in concern. The flowers that each bloomed during different parts of the day, arrayed in an arc in order as they bloomed. Numbers marked each section and allowed the flowerbed to function as a large living clock as it was easy to tell the time by looking at the flowers that were in bloom. It was nearly noon and Wyren was still missing.[PARAGRAPH:1]A squirrel chattered loudly above the priest, hoping he may have some treats. Tuathal scowled back, unhappy to see the animal expecting to be fed rather than gathering the food from the forest himself. But the squirrel wouldn't give up and followed the priest from tree to tree as he walked into the grove between the three temples.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tuathal quietly prayed for some guidance. He couldn't help but feel that something bad had happened to Wyren even if everything else seemed normal. Unhappy at being ignored the squirrel climbed out on the branch closest to Tuathal and then jumped from there onto the satyr statue at the center of the grove. But instead of landing gracefully on the satyr's broad arm the squirrel passed completely through the statue and landed with a confused thud on the ground.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tuathal stared in surprise at the squirrel and the statue he had just jumped through. Pulling an acorn from his pocket he scooped the squirrel up onto his shoulder and gave him the nut while studying the statue. The squirrel studied it suspiciously as well.[PARAGRAPH:1]Slowly reaching out Tuathal's hand passed effortlessly through the statue; it was only an illusion. The real statue was gone.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hemah watched as the grove filled up with priests, city watch, and mages investigating the missing statue. He wasn't worried about being noticed, as a significant crowd of curious travelers, disciples and adepts had turned up to watch what was going on.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon, an elven man with golden hair and green eyes was leading the investigation. He wore the garb of a watch captain but it was obvious from his bearing that he was nobility as well. The captain checked out the statue himself and then after conferring with a shrugging group of mages ordered someone to get Thessa. Hemah leaned forward in interest, this was the first time he had heard her name but he suspected he already knew who she was.[PARAGRAPH:1]While he waited the captain investigated the rest of the grove, ordering people back. He found wagon tracks leading into the grove, and the heavier set leading out. They lead back out to one of the busiest roads in Evermore, where they were impossible to track. But he sent a group of soldiers down the road anyway to see what they could find. He asked another to start questioning the local wagoneers to see if anyone had stored or purchased a wagon capable of carrying a marble statue in the past few days. The day after Beltane there were hundreds of wagons in Evermore that fit that description, but the lieutenant accepted his charge and set off to perform it.[PARAGRAPH:1]Shortly afterwards a beautiful archmage entered the grove and the theorizing mages grew quiet. She talked quietly with the captain, asked a few questions to the mages, who shrugged again, and then went over and knelt down by the statue.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Is the statue of anyone in particular?" she asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]Priest Tuathal scowled but controlled himself before responding, "Surely your studies keep you too long from the temple lady Thessa. The statue is of Gower, favored son of Cernunnos, who was killed by Agares during the first Age. This statue was erected by the elves of that age in memory of him. It is one of the oldest relics in Evermore."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thieves usually aren't that interested in history and there are a thousand statues in Evermore that would have been easier to steal. Is there any reason why this one would be more valuable?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The priest cleared his throat. The eyes of everyone in the grove went to him and the squirrel on his shoulder glared back at everyone.[PARAGRAPH:1]After an awkward silence Tuathal said, "we may need to talk about that in private."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon ordered one of his guards to have the priest taken into the temple for a more private conversation. But Thessa ignored the response, to her it was just another example of how the traditions of the Ljosalfar were keeping it from moving ahead. Taking a deep breath she closed her eyes and began to cast.[PARAGRAPH:1]If she was beautiful, she was even more beautiful while in the throes of magic. Her dark hair, unusual among the Ljosalfar, fluttered and her body strained as she channeled the power needed to cast the spell. Hemah recognized it, she would be trying to follow the link between the illusion and the one maintaining it. She was trying to find him. But just before her spell was completed Hemah released the illusion and the statue disappeared.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What happened, did you dispel it?" Devon asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]With the object of her spell gone Thessa struggled to release the magic harmlessly. Her hands glowed as if stars danced from them and then faded out.[PARAGRAPH:1]"No," Thessa answered, "I hadn't done anything yet. The caster released the spell before I could follow it back to him."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon looked up at the assembled group of spectators, who dumbly returned his gaze. He turned to the last of his lieutenants.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Have everyone here be brought to the barracks for questioning."[PARAGRAPH:1]A few hours later Hemah was still sitting in the barracks waiting to be questioned. All of the citizens of Evermore had been first, and questioning them went relatively quickly. But they were taking their time with the travelers. Hemah had already released the spell he cast on Alazkan's amulet, he hoped it hid him for long enough. And unlike most mages he didn't keep anything magical on him. He was less concerned with the questioning then he was in making sure he got the right questioner.[PARAGRAPH:1]Fortunately Thessa was in charge of examining all the travelers and just after nightfall his name was called and he was shuffled into a small office with her. Thessa looked over the notes a soldier had collected on the group and the items they had taken from Hemah.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Are these yours?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes," Hemah answered.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What are you doing in Evermore?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I came for the festival." Hemah said somewhat honestly.[PARAGRAPH:1]"A common answer today, do you worship Cernunnos?" Thessa asked the questions as a matter of protocol, she was more interested in looking through the items he had. She had the golden feather, mask and bag of incense laid out on the table and she was carefully examining the feather.[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, I'm not really religious. Though I do enjoy the sights of Evermore and the festival."[PARAGRAPH:1]This was the first time Thessa looked up at him, most of the people she talked to today claimed to be worshipers even if they weren't. He had a gentle face, almost soft and would be handsome if he didn't look so tired. He didn't match what she would expect from a merchant, mage or one of the many people that flocked to Evermore for the festival.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What of these items?" she asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The mask is for the festival," Hemah lied, he wore the mask to keep him from seeing his own reflection. That helped keep him from dreaming about himself, which was an exhilarating and terrifying experience.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The feather I found on the edges of your empire. I've only had it for a few days and I'm not sure what to make of it."[PARAGRAPH:1]"It is beautiful." Thessa was more practical than most of the Ljosalfar, and had never seen much value in spiritual or artistic matters but she couldn't deny the draw of the feather. She tested it several times before Hemah came into the room and it was the reason she wanted to question him directly. It wasn't magical, but she couldn't believe the draw it had without magical means.[PARAGRAPH:1]"It's the second most beautiful thing I've seen in your lands."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah's meaning was obvious from the way he was looking at her, but Thessa pretended to miss the compliment.[PARAGRAPH:1]"And the incense?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"It helps me sleep." Hemah honestly responded, "I have troubling dreams sometimes, but if I burn the incense in the room with me I don't have them."[PARAGRAPH:1]"This is an ancient elven craft, I'm surprised to see anyone with it, especially a human. Did you buy it from someone at the festival?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, I met a merchant in Kingsport with it. But I don't know how he got it."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah paused before continuing.[PARAGRAPH:1]"About the feather... I'd like you to have it."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa looked surprised and suspicious so Hemah continued.[PARAGRAPH:1]"As I said, I found it at the edge of your empire, so if anything it is yours anyway. It is too beautiful to be stuffed into my tunic for months on end."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa would never accept a gift from someone being investigated. The fact that he was offering a gift implied his guilt. But she couldn't help feeling that this was different, that this man was lonely and out of place, but not responsible for the disappearance of the statue or disciple Wyren. And she found herself unable to turn down the feather.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Are you sure? This won't affect the investigation at all. You will still likely spend the night in jail."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah nodded, "I'm sure."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa tucked the feather in her dark hair and smiled at him. That vision was forever burned into Hemah's heart and it was all he could do to keep from professing his eternal love for her. Then she leaned across, kissed him gently on the cheek, whispered her thanks and left the room. He was left stunned.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon was watching the interview. There were only a handful of suspects that seemed out of place. Though he suspected they were all dead ends. But seeing Thessa kiss the pale human caused a turmoil of emotions that he was unable to understand.[PARAGRAPH:1]When she came out of the room they met to discuss the results of the interviews. Thessa didn't know he had seen the kiss but sensed immediately that he was distant. As they went through each of the suspects they easily agreed to hold or release each of them until they came to Hemah.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Do you think he is a mage without magic, a kidnapper without a victim, an attacker without a weapon and a thief without the goods? We found the wagoneer that sold the missing wagon, the man he described doesn't match any of our suspects. What is it you suspect about this one?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon was unaccustomed to being so directly questioned from anyone except Thessa, it was one of the things that he loved about her. She was right, but even without the kiss there was something about Hemah that bothered him. Devon's father was an angel in Sucellus's charge and that divine birthright usually made his instincts correct.[PARAGRAPH:1]Unable to settle the dispute they asked priest Tuathal's opinion. He peeked into the room where Hemah sat quietly and considered him. After a few minutes he simply said, "I agree with Devon, there is something suspicious about the man that warrants more scrutiny. I would have him held until we find out more."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon gave the order before Thessa could object. Then Tuathal stepped in to cool the stubborn archmage's temper.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I heard that Devon proposed to you at the festival dance last night. I am sorry it took me so long to congratulate your betrothal."[PARAGRAPH:1]Tuathal's tactic worked and Thessa let her argument go in the face of the priest's good wishes.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, it was an amazing night. I couldn't be happier."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon was also relaxed by the memories of the previous night, "Now we have only to set a day."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa smiled, Hemah's plight was forgotten.[PARAGRAPH:1]A few minutes later guards came and told Hemah he was to be held for further questioning. They led him to a cell where he was locked up with a few pickpockets and a handful of others that were suspected of having something to do with the theft. He went peacefully to the cell, and only argued that he needed his incense so he could sleep. They refused to give it to him and ignored his requests.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah stayed up for most of the night but as the hours went by he found himself drifting off in short bursts. The sleep from the incense wasn't that restful so it had been weeks since he had really slept. In his short bursts of dreams he saw visions of Thessa, the satyr statue, the golden feather as part of the wings of an ancient god, and that god's attack on this very forest. Visions of withered trees and disease.[PARAGRAPH:1]He shook himself awake. These dreams were horrible but he was so tired that he was falling asleep even as he paced back and forth. Eventually the dreams won.[PARAGRAPH:1]When he awoke the barracks was full of concerned guards, mages and priests. Devon was organizing the efforts and getting reports from scouts checking in from various edges of the forest. After a few hours the guards remembered the travelers they had detained and, seeing no opportunity to pursue the investigation and little hope of finding anything if they did, opened the cell and let them go.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah had his mask, incense and other items returned and he was released onto the streets of Evermore. Devon excused himself from his meeting and caught up with Hemah as he walked away from the barracks.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You, where are you going?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah couldn't believe he was going to go through this again.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The guards released me, they said the investigation was suspended."[PARAGRAPH:1]"I know," Devon responded. "I mean you will be leaving Evermore. You will be leaving our forest. You won't return."[PARAGRAPH:1]The captain looked angry and Hemah noticed that the other suspects that had been released weren't given the same speech.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I was hoping to talk to the woman who questioned me before I left. Do you know where she is?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The captain's eyes narrowed, Hemah had found the point of the captain's anger at him and immediately regretted asking the question.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Her name is Thessa, and she is betrothed to me. You will not talk to her."[PARAGRAPH:1]At that Devon called a guard over and ordered him to escort Hemah to the edge of the forest. The guard agreed and with a final glare from Devon Hemah was led away from the barracks.[PARAGRAPH:1]As Hemah walked beside the guard he put on his mask. He was an amazing caster and could cast minor spells simply from sheer strength of will. Especially after the prior night's sleep, he felt more rested than he had in months. As he walked he reached out to the guard's mind. He would travel out to the forests edge alone, all the while believing Hemah walked beside him and left without any problems.[PARAGRAPH:1]After the spell was firmly in place Hemah cut down an alleyway and headed to the mage guild of the city, where he guessed Thessa would be searching for a cause of the corruption that occurred last night.[PARAGRAPH:1]There were three ways to become invisible. Bend light around your body, create an illusion on your body of the surface behind it or simply trick the mind of the person looking at you so that they don't think they see you. It was this last form that Hemah used as he walked into the mage guild. He scanned ahead, finding elves and blocking their mind to his presence. Technically everyone he walked by saw him as he wandered through the hallways and studies of the guild, but they didn't realize it.[PARAGRAPH:1]He didn't try to include Thessa in the spell. She was looking through piles of ancient tomes when he entered the room. She still had the golden feather in her hair.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thessa."[PARAGRAPH:1]She didn't recognize the voice and it took her a second to match the mask with the one she examined the day before. He had a commanding presence and she could feel the magic radiating from him. This figure was much different than the lonely young man she interviewed and a quick touch of her ring warned Devon that she was in danger.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hemah? What are you doing here?"[PARAGRAPH:1]She reached out and felt the magic flowing through the room, mentally preparing to defend herself against a mental or physical assault. Without thinking she pushed the tomes aside to keep them from getting damaged.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I came for you, this blight consumes hope. It will destroy you or Evermore. You must get out of here."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Did you create it?" What she had seen of the corruption growing in the forest was beyond anything she had seen before. She sensed a lot of power in Hemah, but the corruption was something greater.[PARAGRAPH:1]"No," Hemah replied. "You did. It's a memory of an affliction that struck the forest long ago. It was eventually stopped by an angel, but no such angel exists to stop it now. Come with me."[PARAGRAPH:1]"How do you know about the source of the corruption?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah could feel her gathering power. She was planning to attack him but she wanted to see what she could learn from him first.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thessa, I don't know the answer to that, things are revealed to me in dreams. Like I know that if you come with me we will be safe."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon burst through the study door with sword in hand, followed by mages loudly claiming there was nothing threatening the guild. Devon raced across the room, yelling for Thessa to get back but she didnt listen. Instead she channeled a pulse of arcane energy into the room to disrupt any defensive spells Hemah may have active. The mages stopped in alarm as Hemahs invisibility spell dropped and the masked figure popped into view.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon ducked under Hemahs arm and sliced up along his ribs. Hemah screamed in pain and visions of a sleeping god danced briefly in front of his eyes, in a distant place that god stirred. Thessa prepared another spell as Hemah fell to the floor.[PARAGRAPH:1]Looking up Hemah only said, "Forget," and the impact of the word on the room was dramatic and sudden. It was as if Hemah had never been there.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Why did you set off your ring?" Devon asked in exasperation.[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa stood confused, the mages behind Devon continued their objections to his rush into the guild and their claims that there wasn't any danger here.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I don't know," she answered, "I'm sorry it was an accident."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon took a deep breath and sheathed his sword. After a few minutes of apologizing to the mages they finally left him alone with Thessa. She pulled a golden feather out of her hair and stared at it in confusion.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Are you okay?" Devon asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]He sat down and wrapped his arms around her, kissing her lightly on the cheek. She relaxed in his arms.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Did you find anything?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No," Thessa answered, "not yet."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Have you decided on a day for our wedding yet?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa smiled, she wasn't accustomed to pushing off decisions. But she hadn't been able to pick a day yet.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Soon, I promise."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah watched Thessa and Devon leave the mage guild late that night. Devon held her as they walked and despite the corruption approaching the city they were enjoying the time they had together. Hemah dumped his incense onto the street, he was no longer afraid of the dreams.[PARAGRAPH:1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_5]Chapter 5: Beltane Cycle[\LINK]</Italian>
		<Spanish>[LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_1]Chapter 1: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_2]Chapter 2: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_3]Chapter 3: Beltane Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE]Chapter 4: Beltane Cycle[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although it wasn't uncommon for disciples to miss the evening bell during Beltane, and not unheard of to still be missing the next morning, it was out of character for the bookish disciple Wyren. He had been the least interested in the festival and outside of his religious obligations hadn't attended many of the games or displays that crowded the elven capital.[PARAGRAPH:1]Priest Tuathal watched the flowerbed in concern. The flowers that each bloomed during different parts of the day, arrayed in an arc in order as they bloomed. Numbers marked each section and allowed the flowerbed to function as a large living clock as it was easy to tell the time by looking at the flowers that were in bloom. It was nearly noon and Wyren was still missing.[PARAGRAPH:1]A squirrel chattered loudly above the priest, hoping he may have some treats. Tuathal scowled back, unhappy to see the animal expecting to be fed rather than gathering the food from the forest himself. But the squirrel wouldn't give up and followed the priest from tree to tree as he walked into the grove between the three temples.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tuathal quietly prayed for some guidance. He couldn't help but feel that something bad had happened to Wyren even if everything else seemed normal. Unhappy at being ignored the squirrel climbed out on the branch closest to Tuathal and then jumped from there onto the satyr statue at the center of the grove. But instead of landing gracefully on the satyr's broad arm the squirrel passed completely through the statue and landed with a confused thud on the ground.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tuathal stared in surprise at the squirrel and the statue he had just jumped through. Pulling an acorn from his pocket he scooped the squirrel up onto his shoulder and gave him the nut while studying the statue. The squirrel studied it suspiciously as well.[PARAGRAPH:1]Slowly reaching out Tuathal's hand passed effortlessly through the statue; it was only an illusion. The real statue was gone.[PARAGRAPH:2]Hemah watched as the grove filled up with priests, city watch, and mages investigating the missing statue. He wasn't worried about being noticed, as a significant crowd of curious travelers, disciples and adepts had turned up to watch what was going on.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon, an elven man with golden hair and green eyes was leading the investigation. He wore the garb of a watch captain but it was obvious from his bearing that he was nobility as well. The captain checked out the statue himself and then after conferring with a shrugging group of mages ordered someone to get Thessa. Hemah leaned forward in interest, this was the first time he had heard her name but he suspected he already knew who she was.[PARAGRAPH:1]While he waited the captain investigated the rest of the grove, ordering people back. He found wagon tracks leading into the grove, and the heavier set leading out. They lead back out to one of the busiest roads in Evermore, where they were impossible to track. But he sent a group of soldiers down the road anyway to see what they could find. He asked another to start questioning the local wagoneers to see if anyone had stored or purchased a wagon capable of carrying a marble statue in the past few days. The day after Beltane there were hundreds of wagons in Evermore that fit that description, but the lieutenant accepted his charge and set off to perform it.[PARAGRAPH:1]Shortly afterwards a beautiful archmage entered the grove and the theorizing mages grew quiet. She talked quietly with the captain, asked a few questions to the mages, who shrugged again, and then went over and knelt down by the statue.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Is the statue of anyone in particular?" she asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]Priest Tuathal scowled but controlled himself before responding, "Surely your studies keep you too long from the temple lady Thessa. The statue is of Gower, favored son of Cernunnos, who was killed by Agares during the first Age. This statue was erected by the elves of that age in memory of him. It is one of the oldest relics in Evermore."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thieves usually aren't that interested in history and there are a thousand statues in Evermore that would have been easier to steal. Is there any reason why this one would be more valuable?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The priest cleared his throat. The eyes of everyone in the grove went to him and the squirrel on his shoulder glared back at everyone.[PARAGRAPH:1]After an awkward silence Tuathal said, "we may need to talk about that in private."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon ordered one of his guards to have the priest taken into the temple for a more private conversation. But Thessa ignored the response, to her it was just another example of how the traditions of the Ljosalfar were keeping it from moving ahead. Taking a deep breath she closed her eyes and began to cast.[PARAGRAPH:1]If she was beautiful, she was even more beautiful while in the throes of magic. Her dark hair, unusual among the Ljosalfar, fluttered and her body strained as she channeled the power needed to cast the spell. Hemah recognized it, she would be trying to follow the link between the illusion and the one maintaining it. She was trying to find him. But just before her spell was completed Hemah released the illusion and the statue disappeared.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What happened, did you dispel it?" Devon asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]With the object of her spell gone Thessa struggled to release the magic harmlessly. Her hands glowed as if stars danced from them and then faded out.[PARAGRAPH:1]"No," Thessa answered, "I hadn't done anything yet. The caster released the spell before I could follow it back to him."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon looked up at the assembled group of spectators, who dumbly returned his gaze. He turned to the last of his lieutenants.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Have everyone here be brought to the barracks for questioning."[PARAGRAPH:1]A few hours later Hemah was still sitting in the barracks waiting to be questioned. All of the citizens of Evermore had been first, and questioning them went relatively quickly. But they were taking their time with the travelers. Hemah had already released the spell he cast on Alazkan's amulet, he hoped it hid him for long enough. And unlike most mages he didn't keep anything magical on him. He was less concerned with the questioning then he was in making sure he got the right questioner.[PARAGRAPH:1]Fortunately Thessa was in charge of examining all the travelers and just after nightfall his name was called and he was shuffled into a small office with her. Thessa looked over the notes a soldier had collected on the group and the items they had taken from Hemah.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Are these yours?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes," Hemah answered.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What are you doing in Evermore?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I came for the festival." Hemah said somewhat honestly.[PARAGRAPH:1]"A common answer today, do you worship Cernunnos?" Thessa asked the questions as a matter of protocol, she was more interested in looking through the items he had. She had the golden feather, mask and bag of incense laid out on the table and she was carefully examining the feather.[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, I'm not really religious. Though I do enjoy the sights of Evermore and the festival."[PARAGRAPH:1]This was the first time Thessa looked up at him, most of the people she talked to today claimed to be worshipers even if they weren't. He had a gentle face, almost soft and would be handsome if he didn't look so tired. He didn't match what she would expect from a merchant, mage or one of the many people that flocked to Evermore for the festival.[PARAGRAPH:1]"What of these items?" she asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The mask is for the festival," Hemah lied, he wore the mask to keep him from seeing his own reflection. That helped keep him from dreaming about himself, which was an exhilarating and terrifying experience.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The feather I found on the edges of your empire. I've only had it for a few days and I'm not sure what to make of it."[PARAGRAPH:1]"It is beautiful." Thessa was more practical than most of the Ljosalfar, and had never seen much value in spiritual or artistic matters but she couldn't deny the draw of the feather. She tested it several times before Hemah came into the room and it was the reason she wanted to question him directly. It wasn't magical, but she couldn't believe the draw it had without magical means.[PARAGRAPH:1]"It's the second most beautiful thing I've seen in your lands."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah's meaning was obvious from the way he was looking at her, but Thessa pretended to miss the compliment.[PARAGRAPH:1]"And the incense?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"It helps me sleep." Hemah honestly responded, "I have troubling dreams sometimes, but if I burn the incense in the room with me I don't have them."[PARAGRAPH:1]"This is an ancient elven craft, I'm surprised to see anyone with it, especially a human. Did you buy it from someone at the festival?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, I met a merchant in Kingsport with it. But I don't know how he got it."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah paused before continuing.[PARAGRAPH:1]"About the feather... I'd like you to have it."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa looked surprised and suspicious so Hemah continued.[PARAGRAPH:1]"As I said, I found it at the edge of your empire, so if anything it is yours anyway. It is too beautiful to be stuffed into my tunic for months on end."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa would never accept a gift from someone being investigated. The fact that he was offering a gift implied his guilt. But she couldn't help feeling that this was different, that this man was lonely and out of place, but not responsible for the disappearance of the statue or disciple Wyren. And she found herself unable to turn down the feather.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Are you sure? This won't affect the investigation at all. You will still likely spend the night in jail."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah nodded, "I'm sure."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa tucked the feather in her dark hair and smiled at him. That vision was forever burned into Hemah's heart and it was all he could do to keep from professing his eternal love for her. Then she leaned across, kissed him gently on the cheek, whispered her thanks and left the room. He was left stunned.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon was watching the interview. There were only a handful of suspects that seemed out of place. Though he suspected they were all dead ends. But seeing Thessa kiss the pale human caused a turmoil of emotions that he was unable to understand.[PARAGRAPH:1]When she came out of the room they met to discuss the results of the interviews. Thessa didn't know he had seen the kiss but sensed immediately that he was distant. As they went through each of the suspects they easily agreed to hold or release each of them until they came to Hemah.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Do you think he is a mage without magic, a kidnapper without a victim, an attacker without a weapon and a thief without the goods? We found the wagoneer that sold the missing wagon, the man he described doesn't match any of our suspects. What is it you suspect about this one?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon was unaccustomed to being so directly questioned from anyone except Thessa, it was one of the things that he loved about her. She was right, but even without the kiss there was something about Hemah that bothered him. Devon's father was an angel in Sucellus's charge and that divine birthright usually made his instincts correct.[PARAGRAPH:1]Unable to settle the dispute they asked priest Tuathal's opinion. He peeked into the room where Hemah sat quietly and considered him. After a few minutes he simply said, "I agree with Devon, there is something suspicious about the man that warrants more scrutiny. I would have him held until we find out more."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon gave the order before Thessa could object. Then Tuathal stepped in to cool the stubborn archmage's temper.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I heard that Devon proposed to you at the festival dance last night. I am sorry it took me so long to congratulate your betrothal."[PARAGRAPH:1]Tuathal's tactic worked and Thessa let her argument go in the face of the priest's good wishes.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, it was an amazing night. I couldn't be happier."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon was also relaxed by the memories of the previous night, "Now we have only to set a day."[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa smiled, Hemah's plight was forgotten.[PARAGRAPH:1]A few minutes later guards came and told Hemah he was to be held for further questioning. They led him to a cell where he was locked up with a few pickpockets and a handful of others that were suspected of having something to do with the theft. He went peacefully to the cell, and only argued that he needed his incense so he could sleep. They refused to give it to him and ignored his requests.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah stayed up for most of the night but as the hours went by he found himself drifting off in short bursts. The sleep from the incense wasn't that restful so it had been weeks since he had really slept. In his short bursts of dreams he saw visions of Thessa, the satyr statue, the golden feather as part of the wings of an ancient god, and that god's attack on this very forest. Visions of withered trees and disease.[PARAGRAPH:1]He shook himself awake. These dreams were horrible but he was so tired that he was falling asleep even as he paced back and forth. Eventually the dreams won.[PARAGRAPH:1]When he awoke the barracks was full of concerned guards, mages and priests. Devon was organizing the efforts and getting reports from scouts checking in from various edges of the forest. After a few hours the guards remembered the travelers they had detained and, seeing no opportunity to pursue the investigation and little hope of finding anything if they did, opened the cell and let them go.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah had his mask, incense and other items returned and he was released onto the streets of Evermore. Devon excused himself from his meeting and caught up with Hemah as he walked away from the barracks.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You, where are you going?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah couldn't believe he was going to go through this again.[PARAGRAPH:1]"The guards released me, they said the investigation was suspended."[PARAGRAPH:1]"I know," Devon responded. "I mean you will be leaving Evermore. You will be leaving our forest. You won't return."[PARAGRAPH:1]The captain looked angry and Hemah noticed that the other suspects that had been released weren't given the same speech.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I was hoping to talk to the woman who questioned me before I left. Do you know where she is?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The captain's eyes narrowed, Hemah had found the point of the captain's anger at him and immediately regretted asking the question.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Her name is Thessa, and she is betrothed to me. You will not talk to her."[PARAGRAPH:1]At that Devon called a guard over and ordered him to escort Hemah to the edge of the forest. The guard agreed and with a final glare from Devon Hemah was led away from the barracks.[PARAGRAPH:1]As Hemah walked beside the guard he put on his mask. He was an amazing caster and could cast minor spells simply from sheer strength of will. Especially after the prior night's sleep, he felt more rested than he had in months. As he walked he reached out to the guard's mind. He would travel out to the forests edge alone, all the while believing Hemah walked beside him and left without any problems.[PARAGRAPH:1]After the spell was firmly in place Hemah cut down an alleyway and headed to the mage guild of the city, where he guessed Thessa would be searching for a cause of the corruption that occurred last night.[PARAGRAPH:1]There were three ways to become invisible. Bend light around your body, create an illusion on your body of the surface behind it or simply trick the mind of the person looking at you so that they don't think they see you. It was this last form that Hemah used as he walked into the mage guild. He scanned ahead, finding elves and blocking their mind to his presence. Technically everyone he walked by saw him as he wandered through the hallways and studies of the guild, but they didn't realize it.[PARAGRAPH:1]He didn't try to include Thessa in the spell. She was looking through piles of ancient tomes when he entered the room. She still had the golden feather in her hair.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thessa."[PARAGRAPH:1]She didn't recognize the voice and it took her a second to match the mask with the one she examined the day before. He had a commanding presence and she could feel the magic radiating from him. This figure was much different than the lonely young man she interviewed and a quick touch of her ring warned Devon that she was in danger.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hemah? What are you doing here?"[PARAGRAPH:1]She reached out and felt the magic flowing through the room, mentally preparing to defend herself against a mental or physical assault. Without thinking she pushed the tomes aside to keep them from getting damaged.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I came for you, this blight consumes hope. It will destroy you or Evermore. You must get out of here."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Did you create it?" What she had seen of the corruption growing in the forest was beyond anything she had seen before. She sensed a lot of power in Hemah, but the corruption was something greater.[PARAGRAPH:1]"No," Hemah replied. "You did. It's a memory of an affliction that struck the forest long ago. It was eventually stopped by an angel, but no such angel exists to stop it now. Come with me."[PARAGRAPH:1]"How do you know about the source of the corruption?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah could feel her gathering power. She was planning to attack him but she wanted to see what she could learn from him first.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thessa, I don't know the answer to that, things are revealed to me in dreams. Like I know that if you come with me we will be safe."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon burst through the study door with sword in hand, followed by mages loudly claiming there was nothing threatening the guild. Devon raced across the room, yelling for Thessa to get back but she didnt listen. Instead she channeled a pulse of arcane energy into the room to disrupt any defensive spells Hemah may have active. The mages stopped in alarm as Hemahs invisibility spell dropped and the masked figure popped into view.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon ducked under Hemahs arm and sliced up along his ribs. Hemah screamed in pain and visions of a sleeping god danced briefly in front of his eyes, in a distant place that god stirred. Thessa prepared another spell as Hemah fell to the floor.[PARAGRAPH:1]Looking up Hemah only said, "Forget," and the impact of the word on the room was dramatic and sudden. It was as if Hemah had never been there.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Why did you set off your ring?" Devon asked in exasperation.[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa stood confused, the mages behind Devon continued their objections to his rush into the guild and their claims that there wasn't any danger here.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I don't know," she answered, "I'm sorry it was an accident."[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon took a deep breath and sheathed his sword. After a few minutes of apologizing to the mages they finally left him alone with Thessa. She pulled a golden feather out of her hair and stared at it in confusion.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Are you okay?" Devon asked.[PARAGRAPH:1]He sat down and wrapped his arms around her, kissing her lightly on the cheek. She relaxed in his arms.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Did you find anything?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No," Thessa answered, "not yet."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Have you decided on a day for our wedding yet?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa smiled, she wasn't accustomed to pushing off decisions. But she hadn't been able to pick a day yet.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Soon, I promise."[PARAGRAPH:1]Hemah watched Thessa and Devon leave the mage guild late that night. Devon held her as they walked and despite the corruption approaching the city they were enjoying the time they had together. Hemah dumped his incense onto the street, he was no longer afraid of the dreams.[PARAGRAPH:1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BELTANE_CYCLE_5]Chapter 5: Beltane Cycle[\LINK]</Spanish>

She was sitting on the branches of one of the ancient trees when he came walking along the pathway below. She had heard of him, his mother was said to have been so beautiful that an angel fell in love with her. It was their union that produced Devon, who was talented and graceful even by elven standards.[PARAGRAPH:1]As Thessa leaned further out on the branch to get a closer look, he turned his gaze upwards and looked straight into her eyes. She was so shocked she lost her grip on the branch, and tumbled down into the undergrowth below. She lay there stunned, but she was unsure if this was because of the fall or her embarrassment. A tender hand gripped hers, and she was pulled gently to her feet.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Be careful Parvulus, those branches can be treacherous for the unwary. Especially those who keep their attention... elsewhere." He smiled, and that smile would later be counted among her most treasured memories.[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa grew to become one of the most powerful mages in Evermore. In her early years she outdid her fellow students in most disciplines, and sometimes she even surpassed her teachers. Once she managed to make an oak grow to its full size overnight from an acorn she had found on the ground, but the exhaustion of that effort left her unconscious for several days.[PARAGRAPH:1]Only one incident served to disturb the teachers' high opinion of her. She was once discovered reading a grimoire of necromancy, a book stolen from the Calabim in earlier times that most of the senior mages had believed to be long since destroyed, or at least locked up safely. The book was immediately confiscated, and it certainly seemed the young girl had not had time to be lured by the forbidden spells. The incident was soon forgotten, as Thessa proved such a brilliant and diligent student.[PARAGRAPH:1]When her formal education came to an end, she was offered the position of archmage, and her strong sense of duty compelled her to accept, even though her most urgent desire was another entirely.[PARAGRAPH:1]At the Beltane festival she and Devon danced all night. Thessa's long black hair, decorated with a single gold feather, flew around her head in time with the elven songs and flute music. The village danced and played beneath the trees and starlight. It was the most brilliant night of her life.[PARAGRAPH:1]Trouble had arrived to the tranquil forest of the elves. Scouts came from the borderlands with horrible tales-not of an intruding enemy army, but of something more sinister. A strange corruption had started to appear. It made grass wither and die, and turned the more sturdy plants into twisted, pus-filled growths which further spread the corruption along with their seeds. Something had to be done before the animals would start dying, and naturally the help of the archmage was sought.[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa gladly accepted, by then she was so accustomed with her own tremendous power that any task she received seemed easy. Yet the corruption proved too strong for her. Even her most powerful spells of cleansing could only provide momentary relief for a small area, and that at the cost of several days of fatigue. So the corruption was left to roam freely, and it slowly crept towards the center of the forest, and Evermore.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon wished to marry her. He had made that plain to her at the festival, and she could sense his impatience growing as the days grew by. Finally she gave in, even though she had become preoccupied with thinking of ways to stop the slow degeneration of the woods. Their families started preparations for the grand party, the divine union of the archmage and the aasimar.[PARAGRAPH:1]Meanwhile, Thessa continued to fight her losing battle against the mysterious force at work in the forest. She traveled towards the source of the taint, but could not locate a specific place of origin. It seemed to have appeared in many places simultaneously, and she suspected that some malevolent mage may have cast a powerful spell of entropy on her homeland. On her way back home, she found a clearing where two deer lay dead, their corpses a sickening hue of dark purple. She sat down on the ashen ground in despair, but then she had a sudden, horrible, realization.[PARAGRAPH:1]She grieved for the life that had been lost here, and for the life that would be lost in the near future.[PARAGRAPH:1]The wedding party was truly magnificent. There was a banquet of exotic fruit and excellent wine, there were a large number of skilled musicians, there was singing and dancing. Thessa seemed oddly preoccupied during the event, but most of the guests assumed, as did her fiancée, that it was merely stress from working too hard. As night fell, the guests left the clearing under the great red oak tree, leaving the newlyweds alone at the place of the ceremony to consummate their marriage, in accordance with elvish custom.[PARAGRAPH:1]So they both stood there, Devon's eyes so bright with joy and expectation that Thessa could hardly bear to look at him. Yet she forced herself to smile, and gently drew him closer. Devon was too gripped by the moment to notice the lack of light in her eyes, and the tears that had started to appear there. He tried to kiss her, but she pushed him away, looked into his eyes one last time, and gently whispered:[PARAGRAPH:1]"I am sorry.[PARAGRAPH:1]Before Devon could reply, she drew the ceremonial dagger she had tucked in her dress, and stabbed him in the heart, muttering incomprehensible words of a kind that had not been heard in that forest for hundreds of years. Her spell let her drain the divine spirit out of Devon's body and add it to her own magical power. Filled with such vast energies, she invoked the spell of cleansing. A shockwave emanated from the clearing, flowing through air, earth and trees, and as it swept by, the forest was healed.[PARAGRAPH:1]Morning came. The sun shone brightly on a lush and green forest, teeming with life. All except a body in a clearing, and a weeping woman sitting beside it, her head in her hands.</English>

Scouts came from the borderlands with horrible tales-not of an intruding enemy army, but of something more sinister. A strange corruption had started to appear. It made grass wither and die, and turned the more sturdy plants into twisted, pus-filled growths which further spread the corruption along with their seeds. Something had to be done before the animals would start dying, and naturally the help of the archmage was sought.[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa gladly accepted, by then she was so accustomed with her own tremendous power that any task she received seemed easy. Yet the corruption proved too strong for her. Even her most powerful spells of cleansing could only provide momentary relief for a small area, and that at the cost of several days of fatigue. So the corruption was left to roam freely, and it slowly crept towards the center of the forest, and Evermore.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon wished to marry her. He had made that plain to her at the festival, and she could sense his impatience growing as the days grew by. Finally she gave in, even though she had become preoccupied with thinking of ways to stop the slow degeneration of the woods. Their families started preparations for the grand party, the divine union of the archmage and the aasimar.[PARAGRAPH:1]Meanwhile, Thessa continued to fight her losing battle against the mysterious force at work in the forest. She traveled towards the source of the taint, but could not locate a specific place of origin. It seemed to have appeared in many places simultaneously, and she suspected that some malevolent mage may have cast a powerful spell of entropy on her homeland. On her way back home, she found a clearing where two deer lay dead, their corpses a sickening hue of dark purple. She sat down on the ashen ground in despair, but then she had a sudden, horrible, realization.[PARAGRAPH:1]She grieved for the life that had been lost here, and for the life that would be lost in the near future.[PARAGRAPH:1]The wedding party was truly magnificent. There was a banquet of exotic fruit and excellent wine, there were a large number of skilled musicians, there was singing and dancing. Thessa seemed oddly preoccupied during the event, but most of the guests assumed, as did her fiancée, that it was merely stress from working too hard. As night fell, the guests left the clearing under the great red oak tree, leaving the newlyweds alone at the place of the ceremony to consummate their marriage, in accordance with elvish custom.[PARAGRAPH:1]So they both stood there, Devon's eyes so bright with joy and expectation that Thessa could hardly bear to look at him. Yet she forced herself to smile, and gently drew him closer. Devon was too gripped by the moment to notice the lack of light in her eyes, and the tears that had started to appear there. He tried to kiss her, but she pushed him away, looked into his eyes one last time, and gently whispered:[PARAGRAPH:1]"I am sorry.[PARAGRAPH:1]Before Devon could reply, she drew the ceremonial dagger she had tucked in her dress, and stabbed him in the heart, muttering incomprehensible words of a kind that had not been heard in that forest for hundreds of years. Her spell let her drain the divine spirit out of Devon's body and add it to her own magical power. Filled with such vast energies, she invoked the spell of cleansing. A shockwave emanated from the clearing, flowing through air, earth and trees, and as it swept by, the forest was healed.[PARAGRAPH:1]Morning came. The sun shone brightly on a lush and green forest, teeming with life. All except a body in a clearing, and a weeping woman sitting beside it, her head in her hands.</French>

Sie saß auf einem Ast einer der vielen uralten Bäume, als er den Weg unter ihr entlang gewandert kam. Sie hatte schon von ihm gehört, seine Mutter soll so bezaubernd gewesen sein, dass sich ein Engel in sie verliebt habe. Aus ihrer Vereinigung ging der, selbst nach elfischen Maßstäben, äußerst talentierte und anmutige Devon hervor.[PARAGRAPH:1]Als Thessa sich weit über den Ast hinaus lehnte um besser sehen zu können, wandte Devon seinen Blick nach oben und sah ihr direkt in die Augen. Sie war so erschrocken, dass sie den Halt verlor und vom Ast hinunter auf den Boden fiel. Sie lag dort wie betäubt, nicht wissend ob es am Sturz oder doch an ihrer Verlegenheit lag. Eine Hand ergriff die ihre und zog sie sanft auf die Füße.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Seit vorsichtig gnädige Frau, diese Äste können gefährlich für die Unerfahrenen sein. Speziell für diejenigen, die ihre Aufmerksamkeit... auf andere Dinge richten." Er begann zu lächeln und dieses Lächeln sollte später zu einer ihrer am besten gehüteten Erinnerungen werden.[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa wuchs zu einer der mächtigsten Magierinnen von Evermore heran. In ihren frühen Jahren ließ sie ihre Mitschüler weit hinter sich zurück und manchmal übertraf sie gar die sie unterrichtenden Lehrer. Einmal schaffte sie es, eine von ihr gefundene Eiche über Nacht zu einem voll ausgewachsenen Baum reifen zu lassen. Doch waren die Anstrengungen, die dieser Zauber erforderte, zu groß und sie fiel für mehrere Tage in Ohnmacht.[PARAGRAPH:1]Einzig ein Ereignis trübte ihr hohes Ansehen bei ihren Lehrern. Sie wurde entdeckt, wie sie ein Buch der Nekromantie, ein vor langer Zeit von den Calabim gestohlenes Relikt, las, von dem die meisten Magier angenommen hatten, es wäre schon längst zerstört oder zumindest gut weggeschlossen worden. Das Buch wurde sofort konfisziert und es schien so, als ob das junge Mädchen keine Zeit gehabt hätte, irgendwelche verbotenen Zaubersprüche zu erlernen. Der Vorfall war schnell vergessen, als Thessa sich als brilliante und ordentliche Studentin bewies.[PARAGRAPH:1]Als ihre formelle Ausbildung zu Ende war, bot man ihr den Posten der Erzmagierin an, welchen sie auf Grund ihres strengen Pflichtgefühles annahm, auch wenn ihr größter Wunsch ein anderer war.[PARAGRAPH:1]Beim nächsten Beltanefest tanzten sie und Devon die ganze Nacht hindurch. Thessas langes schwarzes Haar, geschmückt mit einer goldenen Feder, wallte um ihren Kopf, ganz im Takt der elfischen Lieder und der Flötenmusik. Das ganze Dorf tanzte fröhlich und ausgelassen unter den Bäumen im herrlichen Sternenlicht. Es war die schönste Nacht ihres Lebens.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nun brach Unruhe über den einstmals so ruhigen Elfenwald herein. Späher kamen mit schrecklichen Nachrichten aus den Grenzgebieten - keine angreifende Armee, etwas viel finsteres geschah dort. Eine eigenartige Verderbtheit trat auf. Sie lässt das Gras verdorren und verwandelt die widerstandsfähigeren Pflanzen in pervertierte und von Eiterbeulen überzogene Gewächse, die die Seuche über ihre Samen weiter verbreiten. Es musste etwas getan werden, bevor auch die Tiere begannen zu sterben. Selbstverständlich war die Hilfe der Erzmagierin gefragt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Guten Mutes willigte Thessa ein zu helfen, mit ihrer enormen Kraft erschien ihr jede Aufgabe einfach zu lösen. Doch selbst ihre mächtigsten Reinigungssprüche konnten nur ein kleines Gebiet für eine sehr kurze Zeit von der Seuche befreien. Und der Preis dafür war eine mehrere Tage anhaltende Ermüdung. So wurde der Seuche freie Bahn gelassen und sie schlich langsam aber sicher auf das Zentrum des Waldes und Evermore, die Hauptstadt der Ljosalfar, zu.[PARAGRAPH:1]Devon wünschte sich, sie zu heiraten. Er hatte ihr beim Beltanefest einen Antrag gemacht und sie konnte fühlen, wie seine Ungeduld von Tag zu Tag wuchs. Schließlich willigte sie ein, obgleich sie vollauf damit beschäftigt war, nach Wegen zu suchen, wie die langsame Entartung des Waldes aufgehalten werden könne. Ihre Familien fingen mit den Vorbereitungen für das große Fest an, die göttliche Vereinigung der Erzmagierin und dem Aasimar.[PARAGRAPH:1]Währenddessen kämpfte Thessa ihren aussichtslosen Kampf gegen die mysteriöse Kraft im Wald weiter. Sie reiste weiter zur Quelle der korrumpierenden Kraft, konnte jedoch keinen speziellen Ursprung entdecken. Es schien so, als ob sie an mehreren Orten gleichzeitig aufgetreten sei und sie zog in Erwägung, dass ein mächtiger Magier einen gewaltigen Zauberspruch der Entropie auf ihr Heimatland gewirkt haben könnte. Auf ihrem Rückweg fand sie eine Lichtung, auf der zwei Tote Rehe lagen, ihre Leichen von einer kränklichen purpurnen Farbe. Sie sank neben den Leichen auf den aschfarbenen Boden nieder und erkannte plötzlich die erschreckende Wahrheit.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sie machte sich Sorgen um das Leben welches hier verloren war und jenes, welches in naher Zukunft verloren gehen würde.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Hochzeitsfeierlichkeiten waren wirklich prunkvoll. Es gab ein Bankett mit exotischen Früchten und exquisitem Wein ebenso, wie eine Anzahl sehr talentierter Musiker. Überall sangen und tanzten die Leute. Thessa sah ziemlich mitgenommen aus, doch die meisten Gäste schoben dies auf ihre großen Anstrengungen, den Wald zu retten. Als die Nacht hereinbrach machten sich die Gäste auf den Rückweg und ließen sie die frisch Vermählten allein um ihre Ehe zu vollziehen, ganz nach Tradition der Elfen.[PARAGRAPH:1]So standen die Zwei da und Devons Augen leuchteten so hell und voller Freude, das es sie einige Überwindung kostete, seinen Blick zu erwidern. Sie zwang sich selbst zu einem Lächeln und zog ihn näher an sich heran. Devon war zu gefangen von diesem Moment, als das er das Fehlen von Leuchten in ihren Augen oder die Tränen, die sie zu vergießen begann, bemerkt hätte. Er versuchte sie zu Küssen, doch sie stieß ihn weg, blickte ihm ein letztes Mal in die Augen und flüsterte:[PARAGRAPH:1]"Es tut mir Leid"[PARAGRAPH:1]Noch bevor er antworten konnte zog sie ihren zeremoniellen Dolch aus ihrem Kleid, stach ihm diesen mitten ins Herz und sprach dabei Worte, wie sie in diesem Wald schon seit hunderten von Jahren nicht mehr vernommen worden waren. Ihr Zauber erlaubte ihr, seine göttliche Seele aus seinem Körper zu ziehen und zu ihrer Zauberkraft hinzuzufügen. Mit diesen gewaltigen Energien ausgestattet, sprach sie den Reinigungszauber erneut. Eine Schockwelle breitete sich von der Lichtung aus, raste durch die Luft, die Erde und die Bäume und als sie nachließ war der Wald geheilt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Morgen brach an. Die Sonne schien hell auf einen sattgrünen Wald in dem es von Leben wimmelte. Bis auf einen Körper auf einer Lichtung und einer neben ihm sitzenden, weinenden Frau, ihren Kopf in ihren Händen haltend.</German>

She was sitting on the branches of one of the ancient trees when he came walking along the pathway below.

It was their union that produced Devon, who was talented and graceful even by elven standards.[PARAGRAPH:1]As Thessa leaned further out on the branch to get a closer look, he turned his gaze upwards and looked straight into her eyes. She was so shocked she lost her grip on the branch, and tumbled down into the undergrowth below. She lay there stunned, but she was unsure if this was because of the fall or her embarrassment. A tender hand gripped hers, and she was pulled gently to her feet.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Be careful Parvulus, those branches can be treacherous for the unwary. Especially those who keep their attention... elsewhere." He smiled, and that smile would later be counted among her most treasured memories.[PARAGRAPH:1]Thessa grew to become one of the most powerful mages in Evermore. In her early years she outdid her fellow students in most disciplines, and sometimes she even surpassed her teachers.

She was once discovered reading a grimoire of necromancy, a book stolen from the Calabim in earlier times that most of the senior mages had believed to be long since destroyed, or at least locked up safely. The book was immediately confiscated, and it certainly seemed the young girl had not had time to be lured by the forbidden spells.

		<English>Dragons were created by the gods during the Godswar. They are machines of war and those that survived the Godswar have generally retreated to remote corners of the world to sleep and wait for their gods to call them to battle again.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Blood Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Body[\H2]Also called an Altar Dragon as it prefers sacrifices. They usually have a pool of blood nearby to drink from, and if their servants don't keep it filled they will usually find themselves added to it. Blood Dragons can take human form, and usually prefer to form of a dark nobleman, always with a goblet in hand. The roar of a Blood Dragon vomits up thousands of blood covered, biting, clawing, flying and venomous creatures, a torrent of creatures that are a mix between bats and scorpions. Blood Dragons maintain a collection of perfectly preserved body parts of their victims, skin, faces, organs, all displayed in a place the dragon can admire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Coral Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Life[\H2]Coral dragons are not a single organism, but a collection of thousands of fist sized insect like creatures called Coralites all working together. They can separate and come back together freely. When they are together they have a breath weapon of white light that resurrects any newly dead (before their soul was collected) that it touches. Even to the point of breathing on a battlefield and raising all the fallen. Coralites occasionally get separated from their colony and have befriended humans as minor pets as they try to work out how to make it back. Coral Dragons collect precious stones, though they will occasionally leave them on the graves of those they respect.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Dawn Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Sun[\H2]These horned dragons glow with sunlight at all times, though they can control the intensity, from an angelic glow to a blinding golden light. Their breath weapon is a blast of light that burns the corrupt but won't harm the pure. Any ally touched by the light of a Dawn Dragon is filled with incredible courage and hope. At dawn each day every Dawn Dragon is fully healed from all injuries, mental, physical or magical and is broken free of any constraints that may hold them. They collect anything made of gold.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Elder Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Force[\H2]The largest of the dragons, Elder Dragons tower over castles and most giants. They are typically avoided by other dragons and most lair together in one remote location, the valley of seven pines, where the gods gathered to forge the compact. These dragons met Kylorin when he came to the valley, and allowed him to take the godslayer with him when he left. He occasionally returns and spends years with the Elder Dragons. Although all dragons are immune to mortal magic, Elder Dragons are even immune to the power of the gods (this was given to them as part of the compact, that they might enforce its commands). The roar of an elder dragon fractures creation, permanently leaving fissures of nothingness in the area. Elder Dragons don't collect anything, but they have a fondness for children of all species and are typically kind to them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Fang Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Earth[\H2]The only flightless dragon. The Fang Dragon can pass through stone and are four times as heavy as it's significant size would indicate. It is quick on land, but when passing through earth it's almost instantaneous. It has no breath weapon, but it's bite easily cuts through stone and metal alike. Flesh and bone are little more than water to them. Fang Dragons can control a powerful magnetic field around their body, either attracting, or repulsing metal. Fang Dragon teeth, horns and scales are prized by enchanters and crafters. But priests of Kilmorph consider them sacred. Fang Dragons collect large gemstones and can be bribed for safe passage with a gem of unusual beauty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Feathered Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Air[\H2]These dragons never leave the sky, they fly endlessly, usually so high above creation they have little impact on the world, or the world on them. They are the fastest of the dragons and can rush over battlefields before most will know they are there. Their breath weapon summons a great wind, from gale force winds to a tornado depending on the dragons whim. These attacks are powerful but unfocused, as likely to damage the dragons allies as its enemies. Feathered Dragons collect light and are mesmerized by the dappled effect of sunshine through leaves, firelight, rainbows and anything that glows or glitters.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Furnace Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Fire[\H2]Sometimes called Torch or Inferno dragons. These large beasts are terrifying mixture of teeth, claws and scales. But their greatest threat is their fiery breath. It isn't just super heated flame that will melt stone and metal, but also a mucus that sticks to anything it hits and causes it to keep burning. Furnace Dragon mucus is barely consumed by this and has been known to burn for days. Furnace Dragon fire can also burn non-corporeal creatures like ghosts and spirits (some brave adventurers try to collect it for exactly this purpose). Unlike most dragons, Furnace Dragons don't collect anything, but they are fond of beautiful music.Like most dragons, Furnace Dragons slept through the Age of Magic, but when Bhall fell they awoke sensing that their goddess was under attack. The fury at the attack and the corruption of their dominion has led them to be very dangerous and unpredictable. They have no idea who is responsible for the pain they felt at Bhall's fall, but are ready to lash out at anyone they see in response to it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Grave Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Death[\H2]These grey giants constantly exhume a green gas that is toxic to all life. Even entering a chamber where one sleeps will kill most people. Grave Dragons collect bones like other dragons collect gold, decorating their lairs with piles of them that would make any necromancer envious. Grave Dragons are immortal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Gold Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Creation[\H2]There were only a few of these dragons created by Amathaon, each were like children to him, beautiful, unique creations. To each Amathaon gave a unique gift, but to all he gave the ability to change form and to breathe a gas that removes causes amnesia and euphoria. Victims forget their former lives and can start anew. Gold Dragons collect items of antiquity, they don't need to be magical or valuable but they have a fascination with forgotten eras and places. A flag of a country that no longer exists, a statue of a man once notable but now forgotten, will delight them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Obsidian Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Dimensional[\H2]These glistening, black serpents looked to be fashioned from polished obsidian. They are fierce and temperamental. They love to fly at night and are swift and quiet fliers. They are thieves and collect items of high craftsmanship, from items as small as rings, to musical instruments, gravestones or statues. Anything that is beautifully made. Most assume that their glowing purple breath weapon is a disintegration beam, as that is the effect it appears to have on the target. But it's actually teleporting the target to a labyrinth within the nexus (which is almost the same as dying). Obsidian Dragons can see through all mirrors near them, and refuse to enter sanctified ground.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Pit Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Entropy[\H2]Also called a Chain Dragon, Demonic Dragon or Dragon of the Depths. These horrific creatures dwell in bottomless pits and Agares has chained a great rock to each of them that they must drag after them. They are capable of short flight even with this rock, but it requires great labor on their part. It is uncertain if Agares did this because he enjoys tormenting the powerful creatures, if they displeased him, or if it serves some other purpose.The dragon exudes an aura of fear that terrifies all life, even without being seen. Though it usually ignores life outside of its pit, it is drawn to suffering. A Pit Dragon's breath weapon is a dark vapor that corrodes metal, withers flesh and crumbles stone, but has no effect on the dragons chains or the great stone it is chained to. Unlike most other dragons, Pit Dragons don't collect anything.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Rune Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Enchantment[\H2]Sometimes called an Astral Dragon or a Ghost Dragon, they usually appear as spirits, though they can manifest physically if they desire. Rather than battle themselves Rune Dragons usually prefer to empower others to great action by binding their spirit with a host for a time. This gives the host great strength, fortitude, willpower and courage as well as the magical effects of skin as hard as a dragons hide, regeneration, immunity to hostile magic and a dramatically heightened power for any magical ability the host may already have. When physical, every scale of a Rune Dragon has been inscribed with an angelic symbol. They are long snake like dragons with wise, patient faces and can breath a silver light that destroys magic for a time. They only collect stories of the heroes they have helped and many are bound to material objects like a jeweled egg, or an ancient sword and if the need arises they make be awakened from that object to help the wielder.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Scaled Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Water[\H2]Scaled Dragon's are the second largest dragon after the Elder Dragon. They can change their form, but not their mass and have been known to appear as great crocodiles or turtles, multi-headed dragons, lighthouses, great trees or small islands. They can also transform their body completely to water, and most commonly are in this form when they are underwater. Their breath weapon is a roar that can be heard for miles, and even further when issued underwater, that will bring help. This help can be from sea creatures, angels of Danalin or even the ocean itself. Scaled Dragons can instantly heal any injuries by pulling more water into their form. They collect shells and polished stones from along beaches and bring them down to their underwater lairs. A drop of their form (which appears as water), can allow anyone who drinks it to breathe water for seven days.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Seed Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Nature[\H2]Also known as the father of hydras (though there is no truth to it), Seed Dragons have three heads. They have no breath weapon but each head has a different venom, one causes a paralysis, another debilitating euphoria, and the third horrific pain. They also have a poisoned stinger on the end of their tail with a venom that causes death. Seed Dragons sleep in remote forest glades, plants grow quickly over them, completely obscuring them. Their presence increases plant growth for miles around. Many thick forests have a slumbering Seed Dragon at their heart, beneath a hill of growth or nestled within the roots of a great tree, though even those walking over them would never know. Seed Dragons collect unusual plants, taking seeds and pollen carefully from new plants to bring back to their glade.Seed Dragons were created during the Godswar by Sucellus, but he never participated in the war. So they were given to forests and areas sacred to him, to defend against those that would wander in and destroy the forests. But since no armies attacked Sucellus they had a peaceful existence, chasing off or killing the rare isolated enemies that would wander to close. Their peaceful nature (despite their threatening appearance) survives to this day and sometimes puts them at odds with Cernunnos's more bestial nature.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Shadow Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Shadow[\H2]if the darkness is left to long, if centuries go by without a hint of light, it can manifest a cruel sentience. A form that swallows light and moves without sound. Shadow Dragons have two breath weapons, the first is a roar that consumes second is a dark tenebrous mass that strikes souls, driving them out of bodies and killing the victim. This leaves the husk of the body behind for just a moment before a shadow claims it, possessing the now abandoned body and using it to serve the dragon. Shadow Dragons are obsessive thieves and enjoy collecting anything that is loved by its owner and secreting it away to their lair.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Shield Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Law[\H2]Also known as Mirror dragons or Silver dragons for the reflective armor Junil has outfitted each with. Shield dragons protect a site or object and would never leave their charge. Most of these aren't holy objects of Junil, but infernal objects of great power that Junil wants to keep from getting out into creation. A Shield dragon protects the depths of Judicium. They do not need sleep, food or water. Their mouths are chained closed by Junil, and though there are rumors that their breath weapon is horrific, no one knows what it truly does. Shield dragons don't collect anything, their attention is focused on the object they guard.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Shimmering Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Spirit[\H2]Shimmering Dragons glow with a white, prismatic light, like glowing pearl. They are beautiful, elegant creatures and occasionally change to a beautiful human form. They are fast flyers, and though they are hesitant to ever attack, they are powerful fighters when they do. Instead of a breath weapon they sing, this can range from a soothing song that puts anyone who hears it asleep, to a sonic attack that will shatter glass and eardrums and crack stone. The tear of a shimmering dragon cures disease and insanity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Siege Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Chaos[\H2]These massive war machines have spikes covering their body. Dead angels are stuck on the spikes as makeshift armor. The Siege Dragon can fire these spikes if it desires, but they prefer charging and impaling victims on them. Warriors of Camulos prize these fired spikes as deadly spears that can easily pierce stone and metal. The roar of the Siege Dragon calls back those it has killed to fight for it, including the angels that form its armor. A Siege Dragon collects the bodies of those it has killed, especially the powerful. Its lair can have thousands of corpses in it, making the effect of its roar truly terrifying.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Spire Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Metamagic[\H2]There was little cooperation during the Godswar. Even gods of similar disposition had occasional battles with each other, though not nearly as brutal as the massive battles that shook creation between opposed gods. One of those battles happened in the Scar of Falling Stars. Kilmorph's army was there, weathered and beaten from days of battle, when an army of Camulos drew close, led by the archangel Odio, who has never been defeated in battle. There was little hope for the children of Kilmorph.It was in that moment that the sky filled with light. Eldritch lightning rained down on the army of Camulos. Oghma had sent his Spire Dragons to aid Kilmorph in the battle. The dragons fought bravely, the night was a hurricane of wings, roars and death. Odio fought the dragons and the army of Kilmorph at once, and in the end he killed every last dragon. There are no Spire Dragons left in creation, they all gave their lives in this battle. There are rumors that a nest of Spire Dragon eggs exist, but if it is so, only Oghma knows where it is.Though they could not beat Odio in battle, Kilmorph sent the Anchors of Creation to bind him on the battlefield. And there he remains to this day, held fast and waiting until he can return to battle.The worshippers of Kilmorph have little love for flying things, but occasionally in their engraving or murals there will be an image of a thin, winged dragon soaring through the sky, lightning shooting from its mouth. This is their tribute to the dragons that died to protect them and our reminder that these graceful creatures once existed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Vault Wyrm[\H1][H2]Dominion: Mind[\H2]Vault Wyrm's are naturally a dirty brown color, but they encrust their body with precious metals and gems that makes them look like a gilded faberge egg. They have thin bat-like wings though many have become too heavy to fly. They can breath out a billowing cloud of gas that causes delirium and hallucinations to those that breathe it, this breath does not affect dwarves. They have acute senses and can feel the lightest steps by touch, hear the sound of the air brushing against skin, and smell past generations on a person. They hate thieves and will chase one to the end of creation for a single lost coin. Clever men will doom a victim by slipping a coin from a Vault Dragon horde into their possessions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Winter Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Ice[\H2]A blizzard always follows a Winter Dragon, and the intensity of the blizzard grows with each Dragon in the group. Winter dragons can range from white to blue, with thick scales, sharp ridges along their back and a mane of grey fur. Once every 21 years Winter Dragons awake and scour their arctic wastelands, killing anything they find. But outside of that brief time period they sleep so deeply not even attacking them will wake them and they can be killed (if you can get through their scales). Hollowmen and worshippers of Mulcarn have taken to protecting their lairs during their rest period, and hiding from them when they are awake. Winter Dragons breath weapon is a ray of frost that is freezing cold and will put a few feet of ice on anything they breath on, usually entombing those alive that don't die to the immediate cold. Winter Dragons collect anything that glitters, gold, gems, crystal or glass. Worshippers of Mulcarn often leave elaborate ice sculptures around there lair and the dragons take care not to destroy them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By Derek Paxton (Kael)</English>
		<French>Dragons were created by the gods during the Godswar. They are machines of war and those that survived the Godswar have generally retreated to remote corners of the world to sleep and wait for their gods to call them to battle again.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Blood Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Body[\H2]Also called an Altar Dragon as it prefers sacrifices. They usually have a pool of blood nearby to drink from, and if their servants don't keep it filled they will usually find themselves added to it. Blood Dragons can take human form, and usually prefer to form of a dark nobleman, always with a goblet in hand. The roar of a Blood Dragon vomits up thousands of blood covered, biting, clawing, flying and venomous creatures, a torrent of creatures that are a mix between bats and scorpions. Blood Dragons maintain a collection of perfectly preserved body parts of their victims, skin, faces, organs, all displayed in a place the dragon can admire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Coral Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Life[\H2]Coral dragons are not a single organism, but a collection of thousands of fist sized insect like creatures called Coralites all working together. They can separate and come back together freely. When they are together they have a breath weapon of white light that resurrects any newly dead (before their soul was collected) that it touches. Even to the point of breathing on a battlefield and raising all the fallen. Coralites occasionally get separated from their colony and have befriended humans as minor pets as they try to work out how to make it back. Coral Dragons collect precious stones, though they will occasionally leave them on the graves of those they respect.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Dawn Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Sun[\H2]These horned dragons glow with sunlight at all times, though they can control the intensity, from an angelic glow to a blinding golden light. Their breath weapon is a blast of light that burns the corrupt but won't harm the pure. Any ally touched by the light of a Dawn Dragon is filled with incredible courage and hope. At dawn each day every Dawn Dragon is fully healed from all injuries, mental, physical or magical and is broken free of any constraints that may hold them. They collect anything made of gold.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Elder Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Force[\H2]The largest of the dragons, Elder Dragons tower over castles and most giants. They are typically avoided by other dragons and most lair together in one remote location, the valley of seven pines, where the gods gathered to forge the compact. These dragons met Kylorin when he came to the valley, and allowed him to take the godslayer with him when he left. He occasionally returns and spends years with the Elder Dragons. Although all dragons are immune to mortal magic, Elder Dragons are even immune to the power of the gods (this was given to them as part of the compact, that they might enforce its commands). The roar of an elder dragon fractures creation, permanently leaving fissures of nothingness in the area. Elder Dragons don't collect anything, but they have a fondness for children of all species and are typically kind to them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Fang Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Earth[\H2]The only flightless dragon. The Fang Dragon can pass through stone and are four times as heavy as it's significant size would indicate. It is quick on land, but when passing through earth it's almost instantaneous. It has no breath weapon, but it's bite easily cuts through stone and metal alike. Flesh and bone are little more than water to them. Fang Dragons can control a powerful magnetic field around their body, either attracting, or repulsing metal. Fang Dragon teeth, horns and scales are prized by enchanters and crafters. But priests of Kilmorph consider them sacred. Fang Dragons collect large gemstones and can be bribed for safe passage with a gem of unusual beauty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Feathered Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Air[\H2]These dragons never leave the sky, they fly endlessly, usually so high above creation they have little impact on the world, or the world on them. They are the fastest of the dragons and can rush over battlefields before most will know they are there. Their breath weapon summons a great wind, from gale force winds to a tornado depending on the dragons whim. These attacks are powerful but unfocused, as likely to damage the dragons allies as its enemies. Feathered Dragons collect light and are mesmerized by the dappled effect of sunshine through leaves, firelight, rainbows and anything that glows or glitters.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Furnace Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Fire[\H2]Sometimes called Torch or Inferno dragons. These large beasts are terrifying mixture of teeth, claws and scales. But their greatest threat is their fiery breath. It isn't just super heated flame that will melt stone and metal, but also a mucus that sticks to anything it hits and causes it to keep burning. Furnace Dragon mucus is barely consumed by this and has been known to burn for days. Furnace Dragon fire can also burn non-corporeal creatures like ghosts and spirits (some brave adventurers try to collect it for exactly this purpose). Unlike most dragons, Furnace Dragons don't collect anything, but they are fond of beautiful music.Like most dragons, Furnace Dragons slept through the Age of Magic, but when Bhall fell they awoke sensing that their goddess was under attack. The fury at the attack and the corruption of their dominion has led them to be very dangerous and unpredictable. They have no idea who is responsible for the pain they felt at Bhall's fall, but are ready to lash out at anyone they see in response to it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Grave Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Death[\H2]These grey giants constantly exhume a green gas that is toxic to all life. Even entering a chamber where one sleeps will kill most people. Grave Dragons collect bones like other dragons collect gold, decorating their lairs with piles of them that would make any necromancer envious. Grave Dragons are immortal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Gold Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Creation[\H2]There were only a few of these dragons created by Amathaon, each were like children to him, beautiful, unique creations. To each Amathaon gave a unique gift, but to all he gave the ability to change form and to breathe a gas that removes causes amnesia and euphoria. Victims forget their former lives and can start anew. Gold Dragons collect items of antiquity, they don't need to be magical or valuable but they have a fascination with forgotten eras and places. A flag of a country that no longer exists, a statue of a man once notable but now forgotten, will delight them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Obsidian Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Dimensional[\H2]These glistening, black serpents looked to be fashioned from polished obsidian. They are fierce and temperamental. They love to fly at night and are swift and quiet fliers. They are thieves and collect items of high craftsmanship, from items as small as rings, to musical instruments, gravestones or statues. Anything that is beautifully made. Most assume that their glowing purple breath weapon is a disintegration beam, as that is the effect it appears to have on the target. But it's actually teleporting the target to a labyrinth within the nexus (which is almost the same as dying). Obsidian Dragons can see through all mirrors near them, and refuse to enter sanctified ground.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Pit Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Entropy[\H2]Also called a Chain Dragon, Demonic Dragon or Dragon of the Depths. These horrific creatures dwell in bottomless pits and Agares has chained a great rock to each of them that they must drag after them. They are capable of short flight even with this rock, but it requires great labor on their part. It is uncertain if Agares did this because he enjoys tormenting the powerful creatures, if they displeased him, or if it serves some other purpose.The dragon exudes an aura of fear that terrifies all life, even without being seen.

Obsidian Dragons can see through all mirrors near them, and refuse to enter sanctified ground.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Pit Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Entropy[\H2]Also called a Chain Dragon, Demonic Dragon or Dragon of the Depths. These horrific creatures dwell in bottomless pits and Agares has chained a great rock to each of them that they must drag after them. They are capable of short flight even with this rock, but it requires great labor on their part. It is uncertain if Agares did this because he enjoys tormenting the powerful creatures, if they displeased him, or if it serves some other purpose.The dragon exudes an aura of fear that terrifies all life, even without being seen. Though it usually ignores life outside of its pit, it is drawn to suffering. A Pit Dragon's breath weapon is a dark vapor that corrodes metal, withers flesh and crumbles stone, but has no effect on the dragons chains or the great stone it is chained to. Unlike most other dragons, Pit Dragons don't collect anything.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Rune Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Enchantment[\H2]Sometimes called an Astral Dragon or a Ghost Dragon, they usually appear as spirits, though they can manifest physically if they desire. Rather than battle themselves Rune Dragons usually prefer to empower others to great action by binding their spirit with a host for a time. This gives the host great strength, fortitude, willpower and courage as well as the magical effects of skin as hard as a dragons hide, regeneration, immunity to hostile magic and a dramatically heightened power for any magical ability the host may already have. When physical, every scale of a Rune Dragon has been inscribed with an angelic symbol. They are long snake like dragons with wise, patient faces and can breath a silver light that destroys magic for a time. They only collect stories of the heroes they have helped and many are bound to material objects like a jeweled egg, or an ancient sword and if the need arises they make be awakened from that object to help the wielder.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Scaled Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Water[\H2]Scaled Dragon's are the second largest dragon after the Elder Dragon. They can change their form, but not their mass and have been known to appear as great crocodiles or turtles, multi-headed dragons, lighthouses, great trees or small islands. They can also transform their body completely to water, and most commonly are in this form when they are underwater. Their breath weapon is a roar that can be heard for miles, and even further when issued underwater, that will bring help. This help can be from sea creatures, angels of Danalin or even the ocean itself. Scaled Dragons can instantly heal any injuries by pulling more water into their form. They collect shells and polished stones from along beaches and bring them down to their underwater lairs. A drop of their form (which appears as water), can allow anyone who drinks it to breathe water for seven days.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Seed Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Nature[\H2]Also known as the father of hydras (though there is no truth to it), Seed Dragons have three heads. They have no breath weapon but each head has a different venom, one causes a paralysis, another debilitating euphoria, and the third horrific pain. They also have a poisoned stinger on the end of their tail with a venom that causes death. Seed Dragons sleep in remote forest glades, plants grow quickly over them, completely obscuring them. Their presence increases plant growth for miles around. Many thick forests have a slumbering Seed Dragon at their heart, beneath a hill of growth or nestled within the roots of a great tree, though even those walking over them would never know. Seed Dragons collect unusual plants, taking seeds and pollen carefully from new plants to bring back to their glade.Seed Dragons were created during the Godswar by Sucellus, but he never participated in the war. So they were given to forests and areas sacred to him, to defend against those that would wander in and destroy the forests. But since no armies attacked Sucellus they had a peaceful existence, chasing off or killing the rare isolated enemies that would wander to close. Their peaceful nature (despite their threatening appearance) survives to this day and sometimes puts them at odds with Cernunnos's more bestial nature.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Shadow Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Shadow[\H2]if the darkness is left to long, if centuries go by without a hint of light, it can manifest a cruel sentience. A form that swallows light and moves without sound. Shadow Dragons have two breath weapons, the first is a roar that consumes second is a dark tenebrous mass that strikes souls, driving them out of bodies and killing the victim. This leaves the husk of the body behind for just a moment before a shadow claims it, possessing the now abandoned body and using it to serve the dragon. Shadow Dragons are obsessive thieves and enjoy collecting anything that is loved by its owner and secreting it away to their lair.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Shield Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Law[\H2]Also known as Mirror dragons or Silver dragons for the reflective armor Junil has outfitted each with. Shield dragons protect a site or object and would never leave their charge. Most of these aren't holy objects of Junil, but infernal objects of great power that Junil wants to keep from getting out into creation. A Shield dragon protects the depths of Judicium. They do not need sleep, food or water. Their mouths are chained closed by Junil, and though there are rumors that their breath weapon is horrific, no one knows what it truly does. Shield dragons don't collect anything, their attention is focused on the object they guard.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Shimmering Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Spirit[\H2]Shimmering Dragons glow with a white, prismatic light, like glowing pearl. They are beautiful, elegant creatures and occasionally change to a beautiful human form. They are fast flyers, and though they are hesitant to ever attack, they are powerful fighters when they do. Instead of a breath weapon they sing, this can range from a soothing song that puts anyone who hears it asleep, to a sonic attack that will shatter glass and eardrums and crack stone. The tear of a shimmering dragon cures disease and insanity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Siege Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Chaos[\H2]These massive war machines have spikes covering their body. Dead angels are stuck on the spikes as makeshift armor. The Siege Dragon can fire these spikes if it desires, but they prefer charging and impaling victims on them. Warriors of Camulos prize these fired spikes as deadly spears that can easily pierce stone and metal. The roar of the Siege Dragon calls back those it has killed to fight for it, including the angels that form its armor. A Siege Dragon collects the bodies of those it has killed, especially the powerful. Its lair can have thousands of corpses in it, making the effect of its roar truly terrifying.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Spire Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Metamagic[\H2]There was little cooperation during the Godswar. Even gods of similar disposition had occasional battles with each other, though not nearly as brutal as the massive battles that shook creation between opposed gods. One of those battles happened in the Scar of Falling Stars. Kilmorph's army was there, weathered and beaten from days of battle, when an army of Camulos drew close, led by the archangel Odio, who has never been defeated in battle. There was little hope for the children of Kilmorph.It was in that moment that the sky filled with light. Eldritch lightning rained down on the army of Camulos. Oghma had sent his Spire Dragons to aid Kilmorph in the battle. The dragons fought bravely, the night was a hurricane of wings, roars and death. Odio fought the dragons and the army of Kilmorph at once, and in the end he killed every last dragon. There are no Spire Dragons left in creation, they all gave their lives in this battle. There are rumors that a nest of Spire Dragon eggs exist, but if it is so, only Oghma knows where it is.Though they could not beat Odio in battle, Kilmorph sent the Anchors of Creation to bind him on the battlefield. And there he remains to this day, held fast and waiting until he can return to battle.The worshippers of Kilmorph have little love for flying things, but occasionally in their engraving or murals there will be an image of a thin, winged dragon soaring through the sky, lightning shooting from its mouth. This is their tribute to the dragons that died to protect them and our reminder that these graceful creatures once existed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Vault Wyrm[\H1][H2]Dominion: Mind[\H2]Vault Wyrm's are naturally a dirty brown color, but they encrust their body with precious metals and gems that makes them look like a gilded faberge egg. They have thin bat-like wings though many have become too heavy to fly. They can breath out a billowing cloud of gas that causes delirium and hallucinations to those that breathe it, this breath does not affect dwarves. They have acute senses and can feel the lightest steps by touch, hear the sound of the air brushing against skin, and smell past generations on a person. They hate thieves and will chase one to the end of creation for a single lost coin. Clever men will doom a victim by slipping a coin from a Vault Dragon horde into their possessions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Winter Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Ice[\H2]A blizzard always follows a Winter Dragon, and the intensity of the blizzard grows with each Dragon in the group. Winter dragons can range from white to blue, with thick scales, sharp ridges along their back and a mane of grey fur. Once every 21 years Winter Dragons awake and scour their arctic wastelands, killing anything they find. But outside of that brief time period they sleep so deeply not even attacking them will wake them and they can be killed (if you can get through their scales). Hollowmen and worshippers of Mulcarn have taken to protecting their lairs during their rest period, and hiding from them when they are awake. Winter Dragons breath weapon is a ray of frost that is freezing cold and will put a few feet of ice on anything they breath on, usually entombing those alive that don't die to the immediate cold. Winter Dragons collect anything that glitters, gold, gems, crystal or glass. Worshippers of Mulcarn often leave elaborate ice sculptures around there lair and the dragons take care not to destroy them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By Derek Paxton (Kael)</German>
		<Italian>Dragons were created by the gods during the Godswar. They are machines of war and those that survived the Godswar have generally retreated to remote corners of the world to sleep and wait for their gods to call them to battle again.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Blood Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Body[\H2]Also called an Altar Dragon as it prefers sacrifices. They usually have a pool of blood nearby to drink from, and if their servants don't keep it filled they will usually find themselves added to it. Blood Dragons can take human form, and usually prefer to form of a dark nobleman, always with a goblet in hand. The roar of a Blood Dragon vomits up thousands of blood covered, biting, clawing, flying and venomous creatures, a torrent of creatures that are a mix between bats and scorpions. Blood Dragons maintain a collection of perfectly preserved body parts of their victims, skin, faces, organs, all displayed in a place the dragon can admire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Coral Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Life[\H2]Coral dragons are not a single organism, but a collection of thousands of fist sized insect like creatures called Coralites all working together. They can separate and come back together freely. When they are together they have a breath weapon of white light that resurrects any newly dead (before their soul was collected) that it touches. Even to the point of breathing on a battlefield and raising all the fallen. Coralites occasionally get separated from their colony and have befriended humans as minor pets as they try to work out how to make it back. Coral Dragons collect precious stones, though they will occasionally leave them on the graves of those they respect.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Dawn Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Sun[\H2]These horned dragons glow with sunlight at all times, though they can control the intensity, from an angelic glow to a blinding golden light. Their breath weapon is a blast of light that burns the corrupt but won't harm the pure. Any ally touched by the light of a Dawn Dragon is filled with incredible courage and hope. At dawn each day every Dawn Dragon is fully healed from all injuries, mental, physical or magical and is broken free of any constraints that may hold them. They collect anything made of gold.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Elder Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Force[\H2]The largest of the dragons, Elder Dragons tower over castles and most giants. They are typically avoided by other dragons and most lair together in one remote location, the valley of seven pines, where the gods gathered to forge the compact. These dragons met Kylorin when he came to the valley, and allowed him to take the godslayer with him when he left. He occasionally returns and spends years with the Elder Dragons. Although all dragons are immune to mortal magic, Elder Dragons are even immune to the power of the gods (this was given to them as part of the compact, that they might enforce its commands). The roar of an elder dragon fractures creation, permanently leaving fissures of nothingness in the area. Elder Dragons don't collect anything, but they have a fondness for children of all species and are typically kind to them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Fang Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Earth[\H2]The only flightless dragon. The Fang Dragon can pass through stone and are four times as heavy as it's significant size would indicate. It is quick on land, but when passing through earth it's almost instantaneous. It has no breath weapon, but it's bite easily cuts through stone and metal alike. Flesh and bone are little more than water to them. Fang Dragons can control a powerful magnetic field around their body, either attracting, or repulsing metal. Fang Dragon teeth, horns and scales are prized by enchanters and crafters. But priests of Kilmorph consider them sacred. Fang Dragons collect large gemstones and can be bribed for safe passage with a gem of unusual beauty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Feathered Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Air[\H2]These dragons never leave the sky, they fly endlessly, usually so high above creation they have little impact on the world, or the world on them. They are the fastest of the dragons and can rush over battlefields before most will know they are there. Their breath weapon summons a great wind, from gale force winds to a tornado depending on the dragons whim. These attacks are powerful but unfocused, as likely to damage the dragons allies as its enemies. Feathered Dragons collect light and are mesmerized by the dappled effect of sunshine through leaves, firelight, rainbows and anything that glows or glitters.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Furnace Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Fire[\H2]Sometimes called Torch or Inferno dragons. These large beasts are terrifying mixture of teeth, claws and scales. But their greatest threat is their fiery breath. It isn't just super heated flame that will melt stone and metal, but also a mucus that sticks to anything it hits and causes it to keep burning. Furnace Dragon mucus is barely consumed by this and has been known to burn for days. Furnace Dragon fire can also burn non-corporeal creatures like ghosts and spirits (some brave adventurers try to collect it for exactly this purpose). Unlike most dragons, Furnace Dragons don't collect anything, but they are fond of beautiful music.Like most dragons, Furnace Dragons slept through the Age of Magic, but when Bhall fell they awoke sensing that their goddess was under attack. The fury at the attack and the corruption of their dominion has led them to be very dangerous and unpredictable. They have no idea who is responsible for the pain they felt at Bhall's fall, but are ready to lash out at anyone they see in response to it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Grave Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Death[\H2]These grey giants constantly exhume a green gas that is toxic to all life. Even entering a chamber where one sleeps will kill most people. Grave Dragons collect bones like other dragons collect gold, decorating their lairs with piles of them that would make any necromancer envious. Grave Dragons are immortal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Gold Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Creation[\H2]There were only a few of these dragons created by Amathaon, each were like children to him, beautiful, unique creations. To each Amathaon gave a unique gift, but to all he gave the ability to change form and to breathe a gas that removes causes amnesia and euphoria. Victims forget their former lives and can start anew. Gold Dragons collect items of antiquity, they don't need to be magical or valuable but they have a fascination with forgotten eras and places. A flag of a country that no longer exists, a statue of a man once notable but now forgotten, will delight them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Obsidian Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Dimensional[\H2]These glistening, black serpents looked to be fashioned from polished obsidian. They are fierce and temperamental. They love to fly at night and are swift and quiet fliers. They are thieves and collect items of high craftsmanship, from items as small as rings, to musical instruments, gravestones or statues. Anything that is beautifully made. Most assume that their glowing purple breath weapon is a disintegration beam, as that is the effect it appears to have on the target. But it's actually teleporting the target to a labyrinth within the nexus (which is almost the same as dying). Obsidian Dragons can see through all mirrors near them, and refuse to enter sanctified ground.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Pit Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Entropy[\H2]Also called a Chain Dragon, Demonic Dragon or Dragon of the Depths.

A flag of a country that no longer exists, a statue of a man once notable but now forgotten, will delight them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Obsidian Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Dimensional[\H2]These glistening, black serpents looked to be fashioned from polished obsidian. They are fierce and temperamental. They love to fly at night and are swift and quiet fliers. They are thieves and collect items of high craftsmanship, from items as small as rings, to musical instruments, gravestones or statues. Anything that is beautifully made. Most assume that their glowing purple breath weapon is a disintegration beam, as that is the effect it appears to have on the target. But it's actually teleporting the target to a labyrinth within the nexus (which is almost the same as dying). Obsidian Dragons can see through all mirrors near them, and refuse to enter sanctified ground.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Pit Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Entropy[\H2]Also called a Chain Dragon, Demonic Dragon or Dragon of the Depths. These horrific creatures dwell in bottomless pits and Agares has chained a great rock to each of them that they must drag after them. They are capable of short flight even with this rock, but it requires great labor on their part. It is uncertain if Agares did this because he enjoys tormenting the powerful creatures, if they displeased him, or if it serves some other purpose.The dragon exudes an aura of fear that terrifies all life, even without being seen. Though it usually ignores life outside of its pit, it is drawn to suffering. A Pit Dragon's breath weapon is a dark vapor that corrodes metal, withers flesh and crumbles stone, but has no effect on the dragons chains or the great stone it is chained to. Unlike most other dragons, Pit Dragons don't collect anything.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Rune Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Enchantment[\H2]Sometimes called an Astral Dragon or a Ghost Dragon, they usually appear as spirits, though they can manifest physically if they desire. Rather than battle themselves Rune Dragons usually prefer to empower others to great action by binding their spirit with a host for a time. This gives the host great strength, fortitude, willpower and courage as well as the magical effects of skin as hard as a dragons hide, regeneration, immunity to hostile magic and a dramatically heightened power for any magical ability the host may already have. When physical, every scale of a Rune Dragon has been inscribed with an angelic symbol. They are long snake like dragons with wise, patient faces and can breath a silver light that destroys magic for a time. They only collect stories of the heroes they have helped and many are bound to material objects like a jeweled egg, or an ancient sword and if the need arises they make be awakened from that object to help the wielder.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Scaled Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Water[\H2]Scaled Dragon's are the second largest dragon after the Elder Dragon. They can change their form, but not their mass and have been known to appear as great crocodiles or turtles, multi-headed dragons, lighthouses, great trees or small islands. They can also transform their body completely to water, and most commonly are in this form when they are underwater. Their breath weapon is a roar that can be heard for miles, and even further when issued underwater, that will bring help. This help can be from sea creatures, angels of Danalin or even the ocean itself. Scaled Dragons can instantly heal any injuries by pulling more water into their form. They collect shells and polished stones from along beaches and bring them down to their underwater lairs. A drop of their form (which appears as water), can allow anyone who drinks it to breathe water for seven days.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Seed Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Nature[\H2]Also known as the father of hydras (though there is no truth to it), Seed Dragons have three heads. They have no breath weapon but each head has a different venom, one causes a paralysis, another debilitating euphoria, and the third horrific pain. They also have a poisoned stinger on the end of their tail with a venom that causes death. Seed Dragons sleep in remote forest glades, plants grow quickly over them, completely obscuring them. Their presence increases plant growth for miles around. Many thick forests have a slumbering Seed Dragon at their heart, beneath a hill of growth or nestled within the roots of a great tree, though even those walking over them would never know. Seed Dragons collect unusual plants, taking seeds and pollen carefully from new plants to bring back to their glade.Seed Dragons were created during the Godswar by Sucellus, but he never participated in the war. So they were given to forests and areas sacred to him, to defend against those that would wander in and destroy the forests. But since no armies attacked Sucellus they had a peaceful existence, chasing off or killing the rare isolated enemies that would wander to close. Their peaceful nature (despite their threatening appearance) survives to this day and sometimes puts them at odds with Cernunnos's more bestial nature.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Shadow Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Shadow[\H2]if the darkness is left to long, if centuries go by without a hint of light, it can manifest a cruel sentience. A form that swallows light and moves without sound. Shadow Dragons have two breath weapons, the first is a roar that consumes second is a dark tenebrous mass that strikes souls, driving them out of bodies and killing the victim. This leaves the husk of the body behind for just a moment before a shadow claims it, possessing the now abandoned body and using it to serve the dragon. Shadow Dragons are obsessive thieves and enjoy collecting anything that is loved by its owner and secreting it away to their lair.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Shield Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Law[\H2]Also known as Mirror dragons or Silver dragons for the reflective armor Junil has outfitted each with. Shield dragons protect a site or object and would never leave their charge. Most of these aren't holy objects of Junil, but infernal objects of great power that Junil wants to keep from getting out into creation. A Shield dragon protects the depths of Judicium. They do not need sleep, food or water. Their mouths are chained closed by Junil, and though there are rumors that their breath weapon is horrific, no one knows what it truly does. Shield dragons don't collect anything, their attention is focused on the object they guard.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Shimmering Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Spirit[\H2]Shimmering Dragons glow with a white, prismatic light, like glowing pearl. They are beautiful, elegant creatures and occasionally change to a beautiful human form. They are fast flyers, and though they are hesitant to ever attack, they are powerful fighters when they do. Instead of a breath weapon they sing, this can range from a soothing song that puts anyone who hears it asleep, to a sonic attack that will shatter glass and eardrums and crack stone. The tear of a shimmering dragon cures disease and insanity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Siege Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Chaos[\H2]These massive war machines have spikes covering their body. Dead angels are stuck on the spikes as makeshift armor. The Siege Dragon can fire these spikes if it desires, but they prefer charging and impaling victims on them. Warriors of Camulos prize these fired spikes as deadly spears that can easily pierce stone and metal. The roar of the Siege Dragon calls back those it has killed to fight for it, including the angels that form its armor. A Siege Dragon collects the bodies of those it has killed, especially the powerful. Its lair can have thousands of corpses in it, making the effect of its roar truly terrifying.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Spire Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Metamagic[\H2]There was little cooperation during the Godswar. Even gods of similar disposition had occasional battles with each other, though not nearly as brutal as the massive battles that shook creation between opposed gods. One of those battles happened in the Scar of Falling Stars. Kilmorph's army was there, weathered and beaten from days of battle, when an army of Camulos drew close, led by the archangel Odio, who has never been defeated in battle. There was little hope for the children of Kilmorph.It was in that moment that the sky filled with light. Eldritch lightning rained down on the army of Camulos. Oghma had sent his Spire Dragons to aid Kilmorph in the battle. The dragons fought bravely, the night was a hurricane of wings, roars and death. Odio fought the dragons and the army of Kilmorph at once, and in the end he killed every last dragon. There are no Spire Dragons left in creation, they all gave their lives in this battle. There are rumors that a nest of Spire Dragon eggs exist, but if it is so, only Oghma knows where it is.Though they could not beat Odio in battle, Kilmorph sent the Anchors of Creation to bind him on the battlefield. And there he remains to this day, held fast and waiting until he can return to battle.The worshippers of Kilmorph have little love for flying things, but occasionally in their engraving or murals there will be an image of a thin, winged dragon soaring through the sky, lightning shooting from its mouth. This is their tribute to the dragons that died to protect them and our reminder that these graceful creatures once existed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Vault Wyrm[\H1][H2]Dominion: Mind[\H2]Vault Wyrm's are naturally a dirty brown color, but they encrust their body with precious metals and gems that makes them look like a gilded faberge egg. They have thin bat-like wings though many have become too heavy to fly. They can breath out a billowing cloud of gas that causes delirium and hallucinations to those that breathe it, this breath does not affect dwarves. They have acute senses and can feel the lightest steps by touch, hear the sound of the air brushing against skin, and smell past generations on a person. They hate thieves and will chase one to the end of creation for a single lost coin. Clever men will doom a victim by slipping a coin from a Vault Dragon horde into their possessions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Winter Dragon[\H1][H2]Dominion: Ice[\H2]A blizzard always follows a Winter Dragon, and the intensity of the blizzard grows with each Dragon in the group. Winter dragons can range from white to blue, with thick scales, sharp ridges along their back and a mane of grey fur. Once every 21 years Winter Dragons awake and scour their arctic wastelands, killing anything they find. But outside of that brief time period they sleep so deeply not even attacking them will wake them and they can be killed (if you can get through their scales). Hollowmen and worshippers of Mulcarn have taken to protecting their lairs during their rest period, and hiding from them when they are awake. Winter Dragons breath weapon is a ray of frost that is freezing cold and will put a few feet of ice on anything they breath on, usually entombing those alive that don't die to the immediate cold. Winter Dragons collect anything that glitters, gold, gems, crystal or glass. Worshippers of Mulcarn often leave elaborate ice sculptures around there lair and the dragons take care not to destroy them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By Derek Paxton (Kael)</Spanish>

		<English>[H1]The Birth of Time[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the beginning there was the One creator. Such was his power that all he spoke and thought was Truth. When first he spoke he made a place of glory and a throne from which he could sit and view all of his creation. This place he named Heaven and his throne was called Order. The One spoke of a blue orb that rested on the arm of his throne. This orb he named Temporance and to it was given the power to control the flow of time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]The Time of Angels[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was now that the One began to speak of new creations. Each one he created he gave a unique name and the twin gifts of life and free will. Each creation was created differently but to the whole he gave the name Angels. There were 21 angels created and each was appointed to be the head of a divine precept.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Each Angel was made to serve the One and to serve the creations that would come after. For the first time other voices were heard as they began to sing and praise the One.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Angel were:[NEWLINE][TAB]Lugus- Angel of Light[NEWLINE][TAB]Sirona- Angel of Wisdom[NEWLINE][TAB]Bhall- Angel of Fire[NEWLINE][TAB]Nantosuelta- Angel of Faith[NEWLINE][TAB]Nemed- Angel of Life[NEWLINE][TAB]Amathaon- Angel of Fertility[NEWLINE][TAB]Junil- Angel of Justice[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Arawn- Angel of Death[NEWLINE][TAB]Oghma- Angel of Knowledge[NEWLINE][TAB]Danalin- Angel of the Water[NEWLINE][TAB]Dagda- Angel of Balance[NEWLINE][TAB]Kilmorph- Angel of the Earth[NEWLINE][TAB]Sucellus- Angel of Nature[NEWLINE][TAB]Tali- Angel of the Air[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Camulos- Angel of Peace, who would become the Angel of War[NEWLINE][TAB]Aeron- Angel of Strength, who would become the Angel of Rage[NEWLINE][TAB]Ceridwen- Angel of the Stars, who would become the Angel of Magic[NEWLINE][TAB]Mammon- Angel of Foresight, who would become the Angel of Greed[NEWLINE][TAB]Esus- Angel of Trust, who would become the Angel of Deception[NEWLINE][TAB]Mulcarn- Angel of Ice, who would become the Angel of Winter[NEWLINE][TAB]Agares- Angel of Hope, who would become the Angel of Despair[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]The Birth of Man[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Heaven was full of many wonders which the angels spent centuries studying and praising. When the One felt them ready he commanded them to take flight outside the boundaries and to fill the vacuum with creations that mirror those of Heaven. He gave them the power of creation. So the angels set off in every direction, creating as it pleased them to create a host of worlds true and good that would serve the One.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When the creation was done there was a variety of worlds and a nearly endless array of life upon them. Each angel created a world in their own preference and all the angels contributed to a common world, called Erebus, which was their greatest creation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although all manner of life and substance had been created in the world the angels wished to create something greater than their individual aspects. Together they agreed to create a race of men that would contain a gift from each of them. This race would be directly descended from the angels and Nemed agreed to sacrifice his precept and become the father of this new race. His precept, that of Life, was given over to Arawn and the angels created an immortal female named Gabella to serve as his wife.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The one entered creation where he stood upon a white stone slab and viewed all things. Seeing this work as good the One took back the power of creation from the angels.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]The Fall of Agares[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unknown to the other angels, and some say even to the One himself, Agares was not willing to lose the power of creation. Knowing he could not hope to keep the power from being taken from him and that he would be left only with the power to manipulate what already existed he used the power while he had it to create infinite wells of raw elements, air, earth, fire, water, life and death. At the center of these infinite reaches he placed gems of each of these elements which he had secreted out of heaven itself. When the power of creation was lost to him he still had enough matter and energy that he could go on creating until the end of time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once the power of creation was gone to him he continued creating in his own world, which he called Nyx, with his infinite plains of elements. He created Nyx not in the fashion of heaven but as he desired. The creatures of this world were not told of other angel's or the One, and Agares commanded they worship him alone. Nyx was a world painted in black and gold, a shadowy reflection of heaven, where the precept of hope controlled every aspect. Dreams, desire, worship and want ruled the shallow creatures that inhabited the beautiful world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The other angels noticed that Agares continued creating. Agares claimed that it was cruel to take the power of creation away from them and that the One was jealous that their creations had outshone heaven itself. Six angels sided with Agares as they were eager to regain the power of creation and he showed them his infinite wells and how to use them to create. These angels were Camulos, Aeron, Ceridwen, Mammon, Esus and Mulcarn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was then that the One intervened. Seeing Agares' blasphemy he sought to remove it from all of creation. By this point however Agares' taint had spread through all of creation, nothing existed that would still exist if he removed the evil from it. Unwilling to destroy creation the One condemned all the Angels out of Heaven, to live among creation until the day he returns to separate the good from the evil. The One tasked the angels still loyal to him with protecting creation and guiding it toward enlightenment until the day he returned.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Those angels that followed Agares opposed the One's decree and took up arms against the angels loyal to him. From this point on the angels that fell were known as Evil by men, those that opposed them and were charged with protecting mankind were known as good and the 7 tasked with maintaining the functions of creations besides man were known as the angels of Neutrality.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After throwing all of the angels from Heaven the One sundered the path between Heaven and Creation so that none but him could pass between them. In response to this all the angels, except Agares, created a host of new angels to serve them. The first they created was their archangel, and behind them thousands more to spread their will across creation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The archangels were:[NEWLINE][TAB]Amathaon- Maponos the Young[NEWLINE][TAB]Sucellus- Cernunnos[NEWLINE][TAB]Bhall- Brigit the Shining[NEWLINE][TAB]Kilmorph- Goibniu[NEWLINE][TAB]Lugus- Baelious ("fortune")[NEWLINE][TAB]Aeron- Odio (who was imprisoned by Kilmorph during the age of dragons)[NEWLINE][TAB]Dagda- Cassiel[NEWLINE][TAB]Mammon- Hastur, Lord of Nightmares[NEWLINE][TAB]Junil- Sabathiel[NEWLINE][TAB]Oghma- Embarr ("imagination")[NEWLINE][TAB]Camulos- The Avatar of Wrath[NEWLINE][TAB]Nantosuelta- Splendor[NEWLINE][TAB]Ceridwen- Kanna, Mistress of Pain[NEWLINE][TAB]Sirona- Pelian the Suffering[NEWLINE][TAB]Esus- Iaegus[NEWLINE][TAB]Tali- Leucetious (Bringer of Storms)[NEWLINE][TAB]Arawn- Gyra and Basium (the twins)[NEWLINE][TAB]Danalin- Condatis[NEWLINE][TAB]Mulcarn- Taranis the Unchanging[NEWLINE][TAB]Agares- None (until the later creation of Hyborem, Lord of the Balors)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But Agares, not satisfied to play the Ones game, did the opposite. He returned to Nyx and destroyed everything there, every creature he had created, every monument that had been built. In one burst of power the beautiful world of Nyx was reduced to ash. The world lies to this day barren, it is called the deepest hell and none would suspect that it was once a world of surprising life.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Creation[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the beginning all manner of natural animals and plants existed in creation, much as in our world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gabella mirrored the rebellion of Agares by refusing to endure her role as a subordinate to man. She fled from Nemed and retreated to the Bair of Lacuna. Further generations of men have the gift of immortality removed from them. But still their divine birthright makes their soul immortal, even if their body fails. It is this connection to the divine, through the angel of Nemed, that allows men to channel the power of the angels and allows their souls to pass to them when they die.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the 6th generation of men Os-Gabella returned and stole two children, Alexis and Flauros to raise as her own. These children become the first vampires, killing others to sustain their life throughout the ages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Age of Dragons[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unable to overcome their differences the gods begin to war across creation. As in all things the gods desires become physically manifested and their aggression was acted out by powerful creatures that battle against each other. Dragons, giants, great elementals and the gods themselves unleashed incredible magic and threaten to destroy creation with it. Mountains are created and destroyed, chasms and lakes were created like gaping scars.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During this time hundreds of angels succumbed to the whispers of Agares. These fell from the service to the angel that had created them. To this day Agares has more angels in his service than any other angel, but none of them were created by his hand. Even his archangel, Hyborem, is a corruption of another.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cernunnos, the great horned one, was the archangel of Sucellus. He dared to attack Agares directly. Agares picked up the powerful archangel and showed him visions of himself dark and corrupted. So powerful was the vision that it became real, splitting Cernunnos into two creatures. They were identical in form but the new creature, which Agares named Hyborem, was dark in aspect and colored in blood. Hyborem and Cernunnos fought but neither could defeat the other. As such, even the archangel of Agares was stolen from another, he is a perversion of the natural.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sucellus and Danalin remain largely out of the fighting. Instead each tends to a group of men that venerate them and that become changed by the close presence of their god. For Sucellus these men become the Ljosalfar, elves born to nature. For Danalin these men become the Aifons, men who can breathe water as well as air.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mankind, the greatest pride of the gods, was almost threatened with extinction. Immanuel Logos, a tribal leader, began the order of the Elohim at the close of this age to care for those injured in the Godswar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When it becomes obvious that the gods battle threatens creation itself Dagda calls for the war to end. The gods meet and the compact is formed, an agreement that the gods would withdraw and only interfere with creation through certain limited means. The Godslayer is formed as a physical manifestation of that agreement, a weapon capable of killing any god.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For some the compact does too much. Basium, the archangel of Arawn, rebels and continues his battle against the Infernals regardless of the compact. For others it does to little. Cassiel, the archangel of Dagda, rebels believing that the gods should withdrawal completely from creation instead of using men to fight their battles for them. Cassiel enters creation to teach men to ignore the will of the gods.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Age of Magic[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Without the destruction of the Godswar man is able to form civilizations. One empire of men is created, Patria, and the people learn from and trade with the Ljosalfar and the Aifons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Patrian nation becomes strong. Basium's battles are mostly in hell, Cassiel is revered among the Patrians who are more philosophical than religious. The children of Os-Gabella, who have learned to leech life from others to sustain their own, are a scourge to mankind and the only real predators to humanity. It is the most peaceful time in mans existence.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During this time Kheldon Ki sculpts the dwarves from his prison home and they are given life by Kilmorph. They tunnel out over a few generations, exploring the underworld. They settle on hills near the human lands. After abuse by corrupt Patrian merchants, many will retreat back to their tunnels, forming the unified nation of the Khazad. Other tribes stay on the surface, creating the Luchuirp, open-sky Dwarves.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kylorin becomes the king of the Patrians. He is a wise and popular ruler, loved by his people. When his wife betrays him Kylorin considers suicide by jumping from the top of his palace. Ceridwen, queen of pain, talks to him there, offering him another deal. That she will give Kylorin eternal youth and have his wife be resurrected in a new form each time she dies so that he may find and remarry her without the memory of her betrayal. The price is that Kylorin will worship Ceridwen and lead the Patrians according to her desires. Kylorin agrees.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ceridwen gifts Kylorin with eternal youth and teaches him magic. He becomes the first archmage and begins teaching others how to use magic to enforce his ever more corrupt rule over Patria. In a few generations his rule is absolute and vile. Sorcerers practice bizarre experiments, creating creatures like manticores, chimera and trolls and rule the fiefdoms in their control as gods. Kylorin directly trains 21 students and puts each in charge of a separate magical school.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These were the names of Kylorin's students:[NEWLINE][TAB]Air- Greysun[NEWLINE][TAB]Body- Kezef (whose experiments killed all the animals on the Grigi plains)[NEWLINE][TAB]Chaos- Carnivean[NEWLINE][TAB]Creation- Majen (elven)[NEWLINE][TAB]Death- Barbatos[NEWLINE][TAB]Dimensional- Os-Gabella[NEWLINE][TAB]Earth- Jenkin[NEWLINE][TAB]Enchantment- Velgyr[NEWLINE][TAB]Entropy- Asmoday[NEWLINE][TAB]Fire- Mikel Dylantyr[NEWLINE][TAB]Force- Paimon[NEWLINE][TAB]Ice- Badb[NEWLINE][TAB]Law- Soqed Hozi[NEWLINE][TAB]Life- Leucetios[NEWLINE][TAB]Metamagic- Gastrius[NEWLINE][TAB]Mind- Perpentach[NEWLINE][TAB]Nature- Herve[NEWLINE][TAB]Shadow- Wode (elven)[NEWLINE][TAB]Spirit- Laroth (who would create his own empire in the underworld)[NEWLINE][TAB]Sun- Tamesis[NEWLINE][TAB]Water- Trenton Majosi (aifon)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kylorin eventually becomes regretful of what he has done to the empire of men and prays for help. Nantosuelta answers those prayers and teaches him how to be an even more powerful mage. Kylorin uses that power to lead a rebellion in his own empire. He sets about subduing or killing those sorcerers who refuse to repent, though some escape his purge.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perpentach was a master of mind magic, and a favored student of Kylorin. Kylorin was unwilling to kill him, imprisoning him instead in a dungeon in the Palus (the Tower of Eyes), guarded by unthinking golems. But Perpentach was more talented than Kylorin suspected, and was able to send his consciousness out wandering further and further from his prison. Searching, creating illusions and controlling minds miles from the dungeon in a process that strained him to the point of fracturing his mind. But he drew hundreds of men to his prison, made them fight and defeat the golems, release him, and declare him their ruler.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The war splinters the empire with Kylorin leading good religious forces against the creations and unholy magic of the sorcerers. By the end 9 human nations have been formed; the Elohim keepers of memories and guardians of the sacred parts of the world; the Bannor, keepers of the sacred fire and the greatest enemies of the sorcerers; the Malakim, desert nomads and men of faith; the Lanun, traders and seamen; the Hippus; horse lords and mercenary's; the Grigori, followers of Cassiel; the Balseraphs, lead by the sorcerer Perpentach; the Illians, who dwelt in the tundra and ravaged lands; and the Calabim, who became ruled by Alexis and Flauros.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Creation settled into its new form. There were still many powerful evils in the world. Sorcerers who still hid in the land and monsters who roamed the wilderness now that their masters were dead. There were many jobs for adventurers willing to recover lost artifacts or investigate hidden areas. And there were wars.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was during this age that the Aifon Trenton Majosi set out on a quest to save his people. He returned with the only salvation possible, a ritual that would allow Danalin to enter creation and save his children. Rather than return to the Godswar Trenton didn't perform the ritual and the Aifons and Trenton were destroyed. The loss of his children from creation caused Danalin to withdraw, falling into a sleep from which he hasn't yet woken.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Agares, the first to fall, whispered to Bhall, the angel of fire, and she eventually succumbed to his words. This was the end of the age of magic. Bhall fell from heaven and that night the sky rained fire. Men loyal to her were transformed into hideous orcish races, becoming the Clan of Embers. The capital of the Bannor empire, which held her greatest temple, dropped with her into hell.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The ritual uncovered by Trenton Majosi had found its way into the Illians hands. They had no fear of a Godswar, since Bhall was responsible for opposing their patron deity Mulcarn. With Bhall fallen their lord was unopposed, and this dispossessed people saw an opportunity to have more than the scraps left for them by the rest of humanity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The world was on fire and although many seers and prophets immediately knew when the ritual began few empires could afford to send armies to stop the ritual that was being performed. Only a the Luchuirp rallied an army. They were golem makers so the burning food supplies didn't affect their army as strongly as other nations. The Luchuirp assailed the Illian capital with the full force of their battle machines, but they were too late. Just as they broke through the city walls Mulcarn entered creation and with a whisper the Luchuirp army was wiped out.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A permanent winter set in across creation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Age of Ice[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The gods considered this breaking of the compact. They were unwilling to restart the Godswar, but couldn't let Mulcarn move into creation unchallenged. They agreed to let one god go into creation to fight Mulcarn. That god was Sucellus, the god of nature.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sucellus entered creation and battled with Mulcarn. At the same time the Ljosalfar turned on themselves. They had agreed to shared power between two queens, one to rule during summer and the other during winter. The winter queen claimed dominance for years as winter showed no signs of ending and refused to give up the throne. This argument created a civil war and the new branch loyal to the winter queen called themselves the Svartalfar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sucellus lost the battle and was killed by Mulcarn. Creation froze even further and the elves were forced to stop their civil war as they could no longer mobilize armies or travel. They tried to find hidden places in the world to remain, and waited for the winter to end to continue their war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The empires of man were crushed by the blizzards and the power of Mulcarn. A few scattered tribes remained, but even these were little more than animals on the edge of survival. All the advancement of the Age of Magic was lost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Illians themselves lived better than most, but their god had little compassion and even they were forced to forgo basic conveniences or technology to maintain the unchanging will of Mulcarn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some tribes gathered together into a new civilization, the Doviello. These men embraced their bestial nature and became more like a pack of wolves then men. They served a use to Mulcarn, by hunting and killing other tribes, and not interfering with the actions of the Illians. And they had little interest in the advancement and change that Mulcarn abhorred so they were allowed to remain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One corner of Erebus held a respite from the winter. The fiery pit that had been the temple dedicated to Bhall held a small portion of her essence, and so continued to burn, giving shelter to the orcs, who prospered in their corner of the world. Meanwhile their kin the Bannor, trapped in Hell, faced a constant struggle for survival. Junil, admiring their determination, sent his Archangel Sabathiel to lead them out. They emerged late in the Age of Ice, in the heart of the orcish territory, sparking a rivalry that persisted for generations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Creation would have remained indefinitely like this had Kylorin not returned. He gathered the scattered tribes of men under one banner, naming them the Amurites. He reforged the broken pieces of the Godslayer and took it into battle against Mulcarn, killing him and ending the Age of Ice.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]GODSLAYER[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]I was born to end an age of destruction. Dragons, angels, leviathans, the mighty armies of the gods clashed as they struggled for advantage.

		<French>[H1]The Birth of Time[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the beginning there was the One creator. Such was his power that all he spoke and thought was Truth. When first he spoke he made a place of glory and a throne from which he could sit and view all of his creation. This place he named Heaven and his throne was called Order. The One spoke of a blue orb that rested on the arm of his throne. This orb he named Temporance and to it was given the power to control the flow of time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]The Time of Angels[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was now that the One began to speak of new creations. Each one he created he gave a unique name and the twin gifts of life and free will. Each creation was created differently but to the whole he gave the name Angels. There were 21 angels created and each was appointed to be the head of a divine precept.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Each Angel was made to serve the One and to serve the creations that would come after. For the first time other voices were heard as they began to sing and praise the One.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Angel were:[NEWLINE][TAB]Lugus- Angel of Light[NEWLINE][TAB]Sirona- Angel of Wisdom[NEWLINE][TAB]Bhall- Angel of Fire[NEWLINE][TAB]Nantosuelta- Angel of Faith[NEWLINE][TAB]Nemed- Angel of Life[NEWLINE][TAB]Amathaon- Angel of Fertility[NEWLINE][TAB]Junil- Angel of Justice[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Arawn- Angel of Death[NEWLINE][TAB]Oghma- Angel of Knowledge[NEWLINE][TAB]Danalin- Angel of the Water[NEWLINE][TAB]Dagda- Angel of Balance[NEWLINE][TAB]Kilmorph- Angel of the Earth[NEWLINE][TAB]Sucellus- Angel of Nature[NEWLINE][TAB]Tali- Angel of the Air[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Camulos- Angel of Peace, who would become the Angel of War[NEWLINE][TAB]Aeron- Angel of Strength, who would become the Angel of Rage[NEWLINE][TAB]Ceridwen- Angel of the Stars, who would become the Angel of Magic[NEWLINE][TAB]Mammon- Angel of Foresight, who would become the Angel of Greed[NEWLINE][TAB]Esus- Angel of Trust, who would become the Angel of Deception[NEWLINE][TAB]Mulcarn- Angel of Ice, who would become the Angel of Winter[NEWLINE][TAB]Agares- Angel of Hope, who would become the Angel of Despair[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]The Birth of Man[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Heaven was full of many wonders which the angels spent centuries studying and praising. When the One felt them ready he commanded them to take flight outside the boundaries and to fill the vacuum with creations that mirror those of Heaven. He gave them the power of creation. So the angels set off in every direction, creating as it pleased them to create a host of worlds true and good that would serve the One.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When the creation was done there was a variety of worlds and a nearly endless array of life upon them. Each angel created a world in their own preference and all the angels contributed to a common world, called Erebus, which was their greatest creation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although all manner of life and substance had been created in the world the angels wished to create something greater than their individual aspects. Together they agreed to create a race of men that would contain a gift from each of them. This race would be directly descended from the angels and Nemed agreed to sacrifice his precept and become the father of this new race. His precept, that of Life, was given over to Arawn and the angels created an immortal female named Gabella to serve as his wife.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The one entered creation where he stood upon a white stone slab and viewed all things. Seeing this work as good the One took back the power of creation from the angels.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]The Fall of Agares[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unknown to the other angels, and some say even to the One himself, Agares was not willing to lose the power of creation. Knowing he could not hope to keep the power from being taken from him and that he would be left only with the power to manipulate what already existed he used the power while he had it to create infinite wells of raw elements, air, earth, fire, water, life and death. At the center of these infinite reaches he placed gems of each of these elements which he had secreted out of heaven itself. When the power of creation was lost to him he still had enough matter and energy that he could go on creating until the end of time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once the power of creation was gone to him he continued creating in his own world, which he called Nyx, with his infinite plains of elements. He created Nyx not in the fashion of heaven but as he desired. The creatures of this world were not told of other angel's or the One, and Agares commanded they worship him alone. Nyx was a world painted in black and gold, a shadowy reflection of heaven, where the precept of hope controlled every aspect. Dreams, desire, worship and want ruled the shallow creatures that inhabited the beautiful world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The other angels noticed that Agares continued creating. Agares claimed that it was cruel to take the power of creation away from them and that the One was jealous that their creations had outshone heaven itself. Six angels sided with Agares as they were eager to regain the power of creation and he showed them his infinite wells and how to use them to create. These angels were Camulos, Aeron, Ceridwen, Mammon, Esus and Mulcarn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was then that the One intervened. Seeing Agares' blasphemy he sought to remove it from all of creation. By this point however Agares' taint had spread through all of creation, nothing existed that would still exist if he removed the evil from it. Unwilling to destroy creation the One condemned all the Angels out of Heaven, to live among creation until the day he returns to separate the good from the evil. The One tasked the angels still loyal to him with protecting creation and guiding it toward enlightenment until the day he returned.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Those angels that followed Agares opposed the One's decree and took up arms against the angels loyal to him. From this point on the angels that fell were known as Evil by men, those that opposed them and were charged with protecting mankind were known as good and the 7 tasked with maintaining the functions of creations besides man were known as the angels of Neutrality.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After throwing all of the angels from Heaven the One sundered the path between Heaven and Creation so that none but him could pass between them. In response to this all the angels, except Agares, created a host of new angels to serve them. The first they created was their archangel, and behind them thousands more to spread their will across creation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The archangels were:[NEWLINE][TAB]Amathaon- Maponos the Young[NEWLINE][TAB]Sucellus- Cernunnos[NEWLINE][TAB]Bhall- Brigit the Shining[NEWLINE][TAB]Kilmorph- Goibniu[NEWLINE][TAB]Lugus- Baelious ("fortune")[NEWLINE][TAB]Aeron- Odio (who was imprisoned by Kilmorph during the age of dragons)[NEWLINE][TAB]Dagda- Cassiel[NEWLINE][TAB]Mammon- Hastur, Lord of Nightmares[NEWLINE][TAB]Junil- Sabathiel[NEWLINE][TAB]Oghma- Embarr ("imagination")[NEWLINE][TAB]Camulos- The Avatar of Wrath[NEWLINE][TAB]Nantosuelta- Splendor[NEWLINE][TAB]Ceridwen- Kanna, Mistress of Pain[NEWLINE][TAB]Sirona- Pelian the Suffering[NEWLINE][TAB]Esus- Iaegus[NEWLINE][TAB]Tali- Leucetious (Bringer of Storms)[NEWLINE][TAB]Arawn- Gyra and Basium (the twins)[NEWLINE][TAB]Danalin- Condatis[NEWLINE][TAB]Mulcarn- Taranis the Unchanging[NEWLINE][TAB]Agares- None (until the later creation of Hyborem, Lord of the Balors)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But Agares, not satisfied to play the Ones game, did the opposite. He returned to Nyx and destroyed everything there, every creature he had created, every monument that had been built. In one burst of power the beautiful world of Nyx was reduced to ash. The world lies to this day barren, it is called the deepest hell and none would suspect that it was once a world of surprising life.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Creation[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the beginning all manner of natural animals and plants existed in creation, much as in our world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gabella mirrored the rebellion of Agares by refusing to endure her role as a subordinate to man. She fled from Nemed and retreated to the Bair of Lacuna. Further generations of men have the gift of immortality removed from them. But still their divine birthright makes their soul immortal, even if their body fails. It is this connection to the divine, through the angel of Nemed, that allows men to channel the power of the angels and allows their souls to pass to them when they die.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the 6th generation of men Os-Gabella returned and stole two children, Alexis and Flauros to raise as her own. These children become the first vampires, killing others to sustain their life throughout the ages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Age of Dragons[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unable to overcome their differences the gods begin to war across creation. As in all things the gods desires become physically manifested and their aggression was acted out by powerful creatures that battle against each other. Dragons, giants, great elementals and the gods themselves unleashed incredible magic and threaten to destroy creation with it. Mountains are created and destroyed, chasms and lakes were created like gaping scars.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During this time hundreds of angels succumbed to the whispers of Agares. These fell from the service to the angel that had created them. To this day Agares has more angels in his service than any other angel, but none of them were created by his hand. Even his archangel, Hyborem, is a corruption of another.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cernunnos, the great horned one, was the archangel of Sucellus. He dared to attack Agares directly. Agares picked up the powerful archangel and showed him visions of himself dark and corrupted. So powerful was the vision that it became real, splitting Cernunnos into two creatures. They were identical in form but the new creature, which Agares named Hyborem, was dark in aspect and colored in blood. Hyborem and Cernunnos fought but neither could defeat the other. As such, even the archangel of Agares was stolen from another, he is a perversion of the natural.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sucellus and Danalin remain largely out of the fighting. Instead each tends to a group of men that venerate them and that become changed by the close presence of their god. For Sucellus these men become the Ljosalfar, elves born to nature. For Danalin these men become the Aifons, men who can breathe water as well as air.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mankind, the greatest pride of the gods, was almost threatened with extinction. Immanuel Logos, a tribal leader, began the order of the Elohim at the close of this age to care for those injured in the Godswar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When it becomes obvious that the gods battle threatens creation itself Dagda calls for the war to end. The gods meet and the compact is formed, an agreement that the gods would withdraw and only interfere with creation through certain limited means. The Godslayer is formed as a physical manifestation of that agreement, a weapon capable of killing any god.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For some the compact does too much. Basium, the archangel of Arawn, rebels and continues his battle against the Infernals regardless of the compact. For others it does to little. Cassiel, the archangel of Dagda, rebels believing that the gods should withdrawal completely from creation instead of using men to fight their battles for them. Cassiel enters creation to teach men to ignore the will of the gods.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Age of Magic[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Without the destruction of the Godswar man is able to form civilizations. One empire of men is created, Patria, and the people learn from and trade with the Ljosalfar and the Aifons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Patrian nation becomes strong. Basium's battles are mostly in hell, Cassiel is revered among the Patrians who are more philosophical than religious. The children of Os-Gabella, who have learned to leech life from others to sustain their own, are a scourge to mankind and the only real predators to humanity. It is the most peaceful time in mans existence.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During this time Kheldon Ki sculpts the dwarves from his prison home and they are given life by Kilmorph. They tunnel out over a few generations, exploring the underworld. They settle on hills near the human lands. After abuse by corrupt Patrian merchants, many will retreat back to their tunnels, forming the unified nation of the Khazad. Other tribes stay on the surface, creating the Luchuirp, open-sky Dwarves.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kylorin becomes the king of the Patrians. He is a wise and popular ruler, loved by his people. When his wife betrays him Kylorin considers suicide by jumping from the top of his palace. Ceridwen, queen of pain, talks to him there, offering him another deal. That she will give Kylorin eternal youth and have his wife be resurrected in a new form each time she dies so that he may find and remarry her without the memory of her betrayal. The price is that Kylorin will worship Ceridwen and lead the Patrians according to her desires. Kylorin agrees.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ceridwen gifts Kylorin with eternal youth and teaches him magic. He becomes the first archmage and begins teaching others how to use magic to enforce his ever more corrupt rule over Patria. In a few generations his rule is absolute and vile. Sorcerers practice bizarre experiments, creating creatures like manticores, chimera and trolls and rule the fiefdoms in their control as gods. Kylorin directly trains 21 students and puts each in charge of a separate magical school.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These were the names of Kylorin's students:[NEWLINE][TAB]Air- Greysun[NEWLINE][TAB]Body- Kezef (whose experiments killed all the animals on the Grigi plains)[NEWLINE][TAB]Chaos- Carnivean[NEWLINE][TAB]Creation- Majen (elven)[NEWLINE][TAB]Death- Barbatos[NEWLINE][TAB]Dimensional- Os-Gabella[NEWLINE][TAB]Earth- Jenkin[NEWLINE][TAB]Enchantment- Velgyr[NEWLINE][TAB]Entropy- Asmoday[NEWLINE][TAB]Fire- Mikel Dylantyr[NEWLINE][TAB]Force- Paimon[NEWLINE][TAB]Ice- Badb[NEWLINE][TAB]Law- Soqed Hozi[NEWLINE][TAB]Life- Leucetios[NEWLINE][TAB]Metamagic- Gastrius[NEWLINE][TAB]Mind- Perpentach[NEWLINE][TAB]Nature- Herve[NEWLINE][TAB]Shadow- Wode (elven)[NEWLINE][TAB]Spirit- Laroth (who would create his own empire in the underworld)[NEWLINE][TAB]Sun- Tamesis[NEWLINE][TAB]Water- Trenton Majosi (aifon)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kylorin eventually becomes regretful of what he has done to the empire of men and prays for help. Nantosuelta answers those prayers and teaches him how to be an even more powerful mage. Kylorin uses that power to lead a rebellion in his own empire. He sets about subduing or killing those sorcerers who refuse to repent, though some escape his purge.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perpentach was a master of mind magic, and a favored student of Kylorin. Kylorin was unwilling to kill him, imprisoning him instead in a dungeon in the Palus (the Tower of Eyes), guarded by unthinking golems. But Perpentach was more talented than Kylorin suspected, and was able to send his consciousness out wandering further and further from his prison. Searching, creating illusions and controlling minds miles from the dungeon in a process that strained him to the point of fracturing his mind. But he drew hundreds of men to his prison, made them fight and defeat the golems, release him, and declare him their ruler.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The war splinters the empire with Kylorin leading good religious forces against the creations and unholy magic of the sorcerers. By the end 9 human nations have been formed; the Elohim keepers of memories and guardians of the sacred parts of the world; the Bannor, keepers of the sacred fire and the greatest enemies of the sorcerers; the Malakim, desert nomads and men of faith; the Lanun, traders and seamen; the Hippus; horse lords and mercenary's; the Grigori, followers of Cassiel; the Balseraphs, lead by the sorcerer Perpentach; the Illians, who dwelt in the tundra and ravaged lands; and the Calabim, who became ruled by Alexis and Flauros.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Creation settled into its new form. There were still many powerful evils in the world. Sorcerers who still hid in the land and monsters who roamed the wilderness now that their masters were dead. There were many jobs for adventurers willing to recover lost artifacts or investigate hidden areas. And there were wars.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was during this age that the Aifon Trenton Majosi set out on a quest to save his people. He returned with the only salvation possible, a ritual that would allow Danalin to enter creation and save his children. Rather than return to the Godswar Trenton didn't perform the ritual and the Aifons and Trenton were destroyed. The loss of his children from creation caused Danalin to withdraw, falling into a sleep from which he hasn't yet woken.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Agares, the first to fall, whispered to Bhall, the angel of fire, and she eventually succumbed to his words. This was the end of the age of magic. Bhall fell from heaven and that night the sky rained fire. Men loyal to her were transformed into hideous orcish races, becoming the Clan of Embers. The capital of the Bannor empire, which held her greatest temple, dropped with her into hell.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The ritual uncovered by Trenton Majosi had found its way into the Illians hands. They had no fear of a Godswar, since Bhall was responsible for opposing their patron deity Mulcarn. With Bhall fallen their lord was unopposed, and this dispossessed people saw an opportunity to have more than the scraps left for them by the rest of humanity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The world was on fire and although many seers and prophets immediately knew when the ritual began few empires could afford to send armies to stop the ritual that was being performed. Only a the Luchuirp rallied an army. They were golem makers so the burning food supplies didn't affect their army as strongly as other nations. The Luchuirp assailed the Illian capital with the full force of their battle machines, but they were too late. Just as they broke through the city walls Mulcarn entered creation and with a whisper the Luchuirp army was wiped out.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A permanent winter set in across creation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Age of Ice[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The gods considered this breaking of the compact. They were unwilling to restart the Godswar, but couldn't let Mulcarn move into creation unchallenged. They agreed to let one god go into creation to fight Mulcarn. That god was Sucellus, the god of nature.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sucellus entered creation and battled with Mulcarn. At the same time the Ljosalfar turned on themselves. They had agreed to shared power between two queens, one to rule during summer and the other during winter. The winter queen claimed dominance for years as winter showed no signs of ending and refused to give up the throne. This argument created a civil war and the new branch loyal to the winter queen called themselves the Svartalfar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sucellus lost the battle and was killed by Mulcarn. Creation froze even further and the elves were forced to stop their civil war as they could no longer mobilize armies or travel. They tried to find hidden places in the world to remain, and waited for the winter to end to continue their war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The empires of man were crushed by the blizzards and the power of Mulcarn. A few scattered tribes remained, but even these were little more than animals on the edge of survival. All the advancement of the Age of Magic was lost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Illians themselves lived better than most, but their god had little compassion and even they were forced to forgo basic conveniences or technology to maintain the unchanging will of Mulcarn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some tribes gathered together into a new civilization, the Doviello. These men embraced their bestial nature and became more like a pack of wolves then men. They served a use to Mulcarn, by hunting and killing other tribes, and not interfering with the actions of the Illians. And they had little interest in the advancement and change that Mulcarn abhorred so they were allowed to remain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One corner of Erebus held a respite from the winter. The fiery pit that had been the temple dedicated to Bhall held a small portion of her essence, and so continued to burn, giving shelter to the orcs, who prospered in their corner of the world. Meanwhile their kin the Bannor, trapped in Hell, faced a constant struggle for survival. Junil, admiring their determination, sent his Archangel Sabathiel to lead them out. They emerged late in the Age of Ice, in the heart of the orcish territory, sparking a rivalry that persisted for generations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Creation would have remained indefinitely like this had Kylorin not returned. He gathered the scattered tribes of men under one banner, naming them the Amurites. He reforged the broken pieces of the Godslayer and took it into battle against Mulcarn, killing him and ending the Age of Ice.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]GODSLAYER[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]I was born to end an age of destruction. Dragons, angels, leviathans, the mighty armies of the gods clashed as they struggled for advantage. Below, the earth trembled, and man was locked into a terrifying existence he could not hope to comprehend.[PARAGRAPH:1]The gods agreed on but one thing--that should they continue their struggle in the same vein or all their work would be lost. The spoils of their war, those sentient beings born of their cooperation at the time of creation, would be destroyed if an agreement was not made.[PARAGRAPH:1]So they came, one by one, to the Seven Pines from the distant corners of Erebus, until all 21 were assembled. The agreement was made, spelled out to the letter. I was the manifest symbol of that covenant, and its enforcement. The Godslayer.[PARAGRAPH:1]The oath each god made in turn bound their fate to me. As they spoke their agreement, their name became etched onto my surface. Then they left, never to set foot personally in creation again, on pain of death. I was left in the care of a human warrior.[PARAGRAPH:1]Centuries past. My purpose was forgotten--the Godslayer was used in battles and wars as any other blade. My pieces were split apart from misuse and by time, but my nature cannot be destroyed.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mulcarn breaks his vow! Take me to him, for he has forfeit his life, and is sentenced to die upon my blade! Take me to him![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Age of Rebirth[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the death of the god of winter Sucellus was reborn, now the god of life. For the first time a god passed between the underworld and creation and doorways were opened between these realms. Through one a group of living elves, pulled long ago into the Dungeon of Laroth, escaped. They brought with them some stolen tomes from Laroth's studies in the underworld. One of which would be used by Sandalphon to teach men to become shades and create the Sidar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Much like the Doviello of the prior age men from various tribes began to gather under a dark banner. This time they are responding to a promise of arcane power. Lead by Tebryn Arbandi and Os-Gabella they are called the Sheaim, powerful summoners who share their secrets openly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lastly Hastur, archangel of Mammon, invades the watery vault of Danalin. Finding the god still sleeping Hastur begins whispering to him, causing nightmares that are reflected in creation.</French>
		<German>[H1]Die Geburt der Zeit[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]Am Anfang war der Eine, der Schöpfer. Seine Macht war so gewaltig, dass alles, was er sprach und dachte, Wirklichkeit wurde. Als er zum ersten Mal sprach, schuf er einen Ort der Herrlichkeit und einen Thron, auf dem er sitzen konnte, um seine Schöpfung zu überblicken. Diesen Ort nannte er "Himmel" und sein Thron wurde "Ordnung" genannt. Der Eine sprach von einer blauen Kugel, die auf der Armlehne seines Thrones ruhen solle. "Vergänglichkeit" nannte er diese Kugel und es stand in ihrer Macht, den Fluss der Zeit zu lenken.[PARAGRAPH:2][H1]Die Zeit der Engel[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]Es begab sich, dass der Eine begann, von neuen Schöpfungen zu sprechen. Jeder einzelnen, die er schuf, gab er einen eigenen Namen sowie die beiden Gaben des Lebens und des freien Willens. Sie waren allesamt verschieden, und doch gab er ihnen den gemeinsamen Namen "Engel". Der Eine erschuf 21 Engel und jedem wurde eine der göttlichen Domänen zugeteilt, die er fortan betreuen sollte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Jeder Engel wurde erschaffen, um dem Einen und allen folgenden Schöpfungen zu dienen. Zum ersten Mal waren nun andere Stimmen zu vernehmen, als sie begannen, zu singen und den Einen zu preisen.[NEWLINE]Die Engel waren:[PARAGRAPH:2]Lugus - Engel des Lichts[PARAGRAPH:1]Sirona - Engel der Weisheit[PARAGRAPH:1]Bhall - Engel des Feuers[PARAGRAPH:1]Nantosuelta - Engel des Glaubens[PARAGRAPH:1]Nemed - Engel des Lebens[PARAGRAPH:1]Amathaon - Engel der Fruchtbarkeit[PARAGRAPH:1]Junil - Engel der Gerechtigkeit[PARAGRAPH:2]Arawn - Engel des Todes[PARAGRAPH:1]Oghma - Engel der Erkenntnis[PARAGRAPH:1]Danalin - Engel des Wassers[PARAGRAPH:1]Dagda - Engel der Ausgewogenheit[PARAGRAPH:1]Kilmorph - Engel der Erde[PARAGRAPH:1]Sucellus - Engel der Natur[PARAGRAPH:1]Tali - Engel der Luft[PARAGRAPH:2]Camulos - Engel des Friedens, der zum Engel des Krieges werden würde[PARAGRAPH:1]Aeron - Engel der Stärke, der zum Engel der Wut werden würde[PARAGRAPH:1]Ceridwen - Engel der Sterne, die zum Engel der Magie werden würde[PARAGRAPH:1]Mammon - Engel der Voraussicht, der zum Engel der Habgier werden würde[PARAGRAPH:1]Esus - Engel des Vertrauens, der zum Engel der Täuschung werden würde[PARAGRAPH:1]Mulcarn - Engel des Eises, der zum Engel des Winters werden würde[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares - Engel der Hoffnung, der zum Engel der Verzweiflung werden würde[PARAGRAPH:2][H1]Die Geburt des Menschen[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]Der Himmel war erfüllt von Wundern und die Engel verbrachten Jahrhunderte damit, sie zu studieren und zu preisen. Als der Eine das Gefühl hatte, sie seien bereit, ließ er sie über die Grenzen hinaus fliegen mit dem Auftrag, die Leere mit Schöpfungen zu füllen, die denen des Himmels glichen. Er verlieh ihnen die Gabe der Schöpfung. Also machten sich die Engel in alle Richtungen auf und schufen, wie es ihnen gefiel, so dass viele Welten entstanden, rein und gut, auf dass es dem Einen dienlich sei.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nach vollbrachter Arbeit waren zahllose Welten und eine nahezu endlose Vielfalt von Leben auf ihnen entstanden. Jeder Engel erschuf eine Welt nach seinen Vorstellungen und alle Engel wirkten an der Erschaffung einer gemeinsamen Welt, genannt Erebus, mit, die ihre großartigste Schöpfung war.[PARAGRAPH:2]Obwohl in der Welt nun alle Arten von Leben und Materie existierten, hatten die Engel das Verlangen, etwas zu erschaffen, das mehr war als ein Ausdruck ihrer individuellen Persönlichkeiten. Sie kamen zusammen überein, eine Rasse von Menschen zu erschaffen, die eine Gabe jedes einzelnen Engels erhalten sollte. Diese Rasse würde direkt von den Engeln abstammen und Nemed war einverstanden, seine Domäne zu opfern und der Vater dieser neuen Rasse zu werden. Seine Domäne, die des Lebens, wurde an Arawn weitergegeben und die Engel erschufen eine unsterbliche Frau, genannt Gabella, die seine Braut werden sollte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Der Eine betrat die Schöpfung und stellte sich auf eine weiße Steinplatte, von wo aus er alle Dinge sehen konnte. Als er sah, dass es gut war, nahm er den Engeln die Gabe der Schöpfung wieder.[PARAGRAPH:2][H1]Der Sturz des Agares[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]Doch weder die anderen Engel noch, wie manche behaupten, der Eine selbst ahnten, dass Agares nicht willens war, die Gabe der Schöpfung aufzugeben. Da er wusste, dass er unmöglich verhindern konnte, dass ihm die Gabe genommen wurde und dass ihm dann lediglich die Macht erhalten bliebe, das Vorhandene zu verändern, nutzte er die Gabe der Schöpfung, solange er sie noch hatte, und erschuf unerschöpfliche Quellen roher Elemente: Luft, Erde, Feuer, Wasser, Leben und Tod. In die Zentren dieser Quellen setzte er Elementarsteine, die er heimlich aus dem Himmel entwendet hatte. Als er die Gabe dann verlor, verfügte er immer noch über genügend Materie und Energie, um bis ans Ende aller Zeiten neue Dinge zu erschaffen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nachdem er die Gabe verloren hatte, konnte Agares in seiner eigenen Welt, die er Nyx nannte und seinen unerschöpflichen Vorrat an Elementen berherbergte, weiterhin neue Dinge erschaffen. Nyx wurde dabei nicht nach der Vorlage des Himmels geformt, sondern ganz nach Agares' Vorstellungen. Die Wesen dieser Welt kannten weder andere Engel noch den Einen und so ließ sich Agares als einzigen Gott verehren. Nyx war eine Welt, die ganz in Schwarz und Gold getaucht war, eine schattenhafte Spiegelung des Himmels, in der alles vom Grundsatz der Hoffnung geleitet wurde. Träume, Wünsche, Verehrung und Bedürfnisse beherrschten die Gedanken der oberflächlichen Wesen, die diese schöne Welt bevölkerten.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die anderen Engel bemerkten das Agares weiterhin schöpfen konnte und stellten ihn zur Rede. Agares behauptete, es sei grausam, ihnen die Gabe der Schöpfung zu nehmen, und dass der Eine neidisch sei, da ihre Werke selbst den Himmel in den Schatten stellten. Sechs Engel stellten sich hinter Agares, da sie begierig auf die Wiedererlangung der Gabe waren und so zeigte er ihnen seine unerschöpflichen Quellen und wie man sie zur Schöpfung benutzen konnte. Diese Engel waren Camulos, Aeron, Ceridwen, Mammon, Esus und Mulcarn.[PARAGRAPH:2]Für den Einen war es an der Zeit zu handeln. Als er Agares' Blasphemien bemerkte, wollte er sie sofort aus der Schöpfung verbannen. Aber zu jenem Zeitpunkt hatte sich Agares' Verderbtheit schon in der gesamten Schöpfung verbreitet, nichts war verblieben, das weiterexistieren hätte können, wenn das Böse daraus entfernt worden wäre. Dies war jedoch nicht sein Wille und so verbannte der Eine alle Engel aus dem Himmel, auf dass sie inmitten der Schöpfung leben sollten, bis zu dem Tag, an dem er zurückkehre, um die Guten von den Schlechten zu trennen. Der Eine beauftragte einige der ihm treuen Engel damit, bis zu seiner Rückkehr über die Schöpfung zu wachen und sie zur Erleuchtung zu führen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Engel aus Agares' Gefolge widersetzten sich der Verfügung des Einen und wappneten sich zum Kampf gegen die Engel, die loyal zu ihm standen. Seither werden die gefallenen Engel von den Menschen "Böse" und diejenigen, die sich ihnen entgegenstellten und mit dem Schutz der Menschheit beauftragt waren, "Gut" genannt, während die 7, die neben den Menschen mit der Erhaltung des Kreislaufs der Schöpfung beauftragt wurden, Engel der Neutralität geheißen werden.[PARAGRAPH:2]Nach der Verbannung der Engel aus dem Himmel trennte der Eine die Verbindung zwischen Himmel und Schöpfung, so dass lediglich er die Grenze überschreiten konnte. Als Reaktion darauf erschufen alle Engel außer Agares, eine Schar neuer Engel, die ihnen dienen sollten. Als erstes erschuf sich jeder von ihnen einen Erzengel und danach Tausende mehr, um ihren Willen in der gesamten Schöpfung zu verkünden.[NEWLINE]Die Erzengel waren:[PARAGRAPH:2]Amathaon: Maponos der Jüngere[PARAGRAPH:1]Sucellus: Cernunnos[PARAGRAPH:1]Bhall: Brigit die Strahlende[PARAGRAPH:1]Kilmorph: Goibniu[PARAGRAPH:1]Lugus: Baelious ("Glück")[PARAGRAPH:1]Aeron: Odio (der von Kilmorph während des Zeitalters der Darchen eingekerkert wurde)[PARAGRAPH:1]Dagda: Cassiel[PARAGRAPH:1]Mammon: Hastur, Herr der Alpträume[PARAGRAPH:1]Junil: Sabathiel[PARAGRAPH:1]Oghma: Embarr ("Fantasie")[PARAGRAPH:1]Camulos: Der Avatar des Zorns[PARAGRAPH:1]Nantosuelta: Splendor[PARAGRAPH:1]Ceridwen: Kanna, Herrin des Schmerzes[PARAGRAPH:1]Sirona: Pelian der Leidende[PARAGRAPH:1]Esus: Iaegus[PARAGRAPH:1]Tali: Leucetious (Bringer der Stürme)[PARAGRAPH:1]Arawn: Gyra und Basium (die Zwillinge)[PARAGRAPH:1]Danalin: Condatis[PARAGRAPH:1]Mulcarn: Taranis der Unveränderliche[PARAGRAPH:1]Agares: Keiner (bis zur späteren Erschaffung von Hyborem, Meister der Balor)[PARAGRAPH:2]Aber Agares war nicht zufrieden damit, nur eine Figur im Spiel des Einen zu sein, und tat deshalb genau das Gegenteil von dem, was von ihm erwartet wurde. Er kehrte zurück nach Nyx und zerstörte dort alles, jedes Wesen, das er erschaffen hatte, jedes Monument, das aufgestellt worden war. Mit einer einzigen Entladung seiner Macht wurde die schöne Welt Nyx zu Asche verbrannt. Diese Welt ist bis heute unfruchtbar, sie wird auch die tiefste Hölle genannt und niemand würde vermuten, dass sie einst von erstaunlich vielfältigen Wesen bevölkert worden war.[PARAGRAPH:2][H1]Die Schöpfung[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]Am Anfang existierten alle Arten von Tieren und Pflanzen in der Schöpfung, ähnlich wie in unserer Welt.[PARAGRAPH:2]In einer Art Nachahmung von Agares' Rebellion weigerte sich Gabella, ihre Rolle als Untergebene des Mannes zu erdulden. Sie verließ Nemed und floh zum Bair von Lacuna. Dadurch wurde den folgenden Generationen der Menschen das Geschenk der Unsterblichkeit genommen. Aber durch ihr göttliches Geburtsrecht sind ihre Seelen immer noch unsterblich, sogar wenn ihre sterblichen Körper dem Alter anheim fallen. Diese Verbindung zum Göttlichen, die durch den Engel Nemed aufrechterhalten wird, erlaubt den Menschen, die Kraft der Engel zu kanalisieren und ihnen ihre Seelen anzuvertrauen, wenn sie sterben.[PARAGRAPH:2]In der sechsten Generation der Menschheit kehrte Os-Gabella zurück und entführte zwei Kinder, Alexis und Flauros, die sie als ihre eigenen aufziehen wollte. Diese Kinder wurden zu den ersten Vampiren: sie töten andere, um ihre Leben durch die Jahrhunderte zu erhalten.[PARAGRAPH:2][H1]Das Zeitalter der Drachen[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]Unfähig ihre Differenzen beizulegen, begannen die einstigen Engel und jetzigen Götter einen Krieg, der die gesamte Schöpfung umspannte. Wie auch schon zuvor wurden alle Dinge Wirklichkeit, die sich die ehemaligen Engel vorstellten, und ihre Angriffe aufeinander wurden von mächtigen Kreaturen ausgeführt, die an ihrer statt gegeneinander kämpften. Drachen, Riesen, mächtige Elementare und die Götter selbst entfesselten unfassbare magische Kräfte und drohten so, die Schöpfung zu vernichten. Gebirgszüge wurden erschaffen und wieder eingeebnet, Schluchten und Seen wurden wie klaffende Narben in das Gesicht der Schöpfung geschlagen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Während dieser Zeit verfielen Hunderte von Engeln den Einflüsterungen des Agares und kehrten den Engeln, die sie erschaffen hatten, den Rücken. Damals gehorchten Agares mehr Engel als jedem anderen Engel, aber keiner von ihnen wurde auch von seiner Hand erschaffen. Sogar sein Erzengel, Hyborem, war aus der Verderbnis eines anderen Erzengels entstanden.[PARAGRAPH:2]Cernunnos, der große Gehörnte, war der Erzengel von Sucellus und er wagte es, Agares direkt herauszufordern. Also nahm Agares den mächtigen Erzengel gefangen und schickte ihm Visionen, die Cernunnos als dunkles und verdorbenes Wesen zeigten. Die Vision war so mächtig, dass sie Wirklichkeit wurde und Cernunnos in zwei verschiedene Kreaturen aufspaltete. Ihre Gestalt war identisch, aber die neue Kreatur, die Agares "Hyborem" taufte, besaß ein dunkles Wesen und ihre Haut hatte eine blutrote Färbung. Hyborem und Cernunnos kämpften gegeneinander, aber keiner konnte den anderen besiegen. Und so stahl Agares sogar den Erzengel eines anderen, der nun eine Perversion des ursprünglichen war.[PARAGRAPH:2]Sucellus und Danalin konnten sich aus den Kämpfen weitestgehend heraushalten. Stattdessen förderte jeder von ihnen eine Gruppe von Menschen, die sie jeweils verehrten und die von der großen Nähe ihres Gottes verändert wurden. Aus Sucellus' Menschen wurden die Ljosalfar, Elfen, die der Natur verpflichtet waren. Aus Danalins Menschen wurden die Aifons, Menschen, die sowohl Wasser als auch Luft atmen konnten.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Menschheit selbst, der größte Stolz der Götter, war fast vom Aussterben bedroht. Daher begründete Immanuel Logos, ein Stammesführer, den Orden der Elohim gegen Ende des Zeitalters, um für jene zu sorgen, die im Krieg der Götter verwundet wurden.[PARAGRAPH:2]Als es offensichtlich wurde, dass der Streit unter den Göttern, die Schöpfung selbst zu vernichten drohte, rief Dagda dazu auf, den Krieg zu beenden. Die Götter versammelten sich und der "Pakt" wurde in Kraft gesetzt, ein Abkommen, das den Abzug der Götter regelte und die Eingriffsmöglichkeiten in die Schöpfung stark beschränkte. Als sichtbares Zeichen dieses Abkommens wurde eine überaus mächtige Waffe geschmiedet, der Gottesschlächter, eine Waffe, die selbst einen Gott töten konnte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Einigen ging der Pakt allerdings zu weit. Basium, der Erzengel von Arawn, rebellierte und setzte seinen Kampf gegen die Infernalen fort, ungeachtet des beschlossenen Abkommens. Anderen ging er dagegen nicht weit genug. Cassiel, der Erzengel von Dagda, rebellierte, weil er glaubte, dass sich die Götter komplett aus der Schöpfung zurückziehen und ihre Kämpfe nicht von Menschen austragen lassen sollten. Deshalb betrat Cassiel die Schöpfung erneut, um den Menschen beizubringen, dass sie den Willen der Götter einfach ignorieren sollten.[PARAGRAPH:2][H1]Das Zeitalter der Magie[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]Ohne die Zerstörungen des Kriegs der Götter konnten die Menschen endlich beginnen, Zivilisationen zu gründen. Die Menschen schufen sich ein Imperium, genannt Patria, und lernten von den Ljosalfar und den Aifons und trieben auch Handel mit ihnen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Das patrianische Imperium wuchs in dieser Zeit zu großer Stärke heran. Basium trug seine Kämpfe größtenteils in der Hölle aus und Cassiel wurde unter den Patrianern verehrt, die eher philosophisch als religiös orientiert waren. Die Kinder von Os-Gabella, die gelernt hatten, anderen das Leben auszusaugen, um ihr eigenes zu verlängern, waren die Geißel der Menschheit und die einzigen, wirklich gefährlichen Raubtiere. Es war die friedvollste Zeit, die der Mensch seit seiner Erschaffung erlebt hatte.[PARAGRAPH:2]Während dieser Epoche formte Kheldon Ki die Zwerge aus dem Stein seines Gefängnisses, denen dann von Kilmorph Leben eingehaucht wurde. Sie gruben für einige Generationen Tunnel durch die Kruste von Erebus und erforschten die Unterwelt. Schließlich siedelten sie sich in Hügeln in der Nähe der Menschenländer an. Aber nachdem die Zwerge von korrupten patrianischen Händler betrogen und beschimpft wurden, zogen sich viele von ihnen in die Tunnel zurück und gründeten die vereinte Nation der Khazad. Andere Stämme blieben an der Oberfläche und bildeten die Gemeinschaft der Luchuirp, die Zwerge der Oberwelt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Währenddessen bestieg Kylorin den Königsthron von Patria. Er war ein weiser und beliebter Herrscher, der von seinem Volk geliebt wurde. Als seine Frau ihn verriet, wollte Kylorin schon mit einem Sprung von der höchsten Spitze seines Palastes Selbstmord begehen. Aber Ceridwen, die Königin der Schmerzen, erschien ihm kurz zuvor und schlug ihm einen anderen Handel vor. Sie würde Kylorin das Geschenk der ewigen Jugend verleihen und seine Frau jedes Mal in neuer Gestalt wiederauferstehen lassen, wenn sie sterben würde, damit er sie finden und erneut heiraten könnte, ohne dass sie sich an ihren Verrat erinnern würde. Als Preis dafür verlangte Cerdiwen, dass Kylorin sie anbeten und er die Patrianer nach ihren Wünschen führen würde. Kylorin stimmte zu.[PARAGRAPH:2]So schenkte Cerdiwen Kylorin ewige Jugend und lehrte ihn den Einsatz der Magie. Er wurde zum ersten Erzmagier und begann, auch anderen den Einsatz der Magie zu lehren, um seine immer korruptere Herrschaft über Patria aufrechterhalten zu können. Nach einigen Generationen war seine Herrschaft unangefochten und abscheulich. Zauberer führten bizarre Experimente durch, erschuffen Kreaturen wie die Mantikoren, die Chimären und die Trolle und herrschten über die von ihnen kontrollierten Lehen wie Götter. Kylorin selbst gab seine Lehren an 21 Schüler weiter und betraute jeden von ihnen mit der Lehre einer bestimmten magischen Schule.[NEWLINE]Die Schüler von Kylorin waren:[PARAGRAPH:2]Luftmagie - Greysun[PARAGRAPH:1]Körpermagie - Kezef (durch dessen Experimente alle Tiere der Grigi-Ebenen getötet wurden)[PARAGRAPH:1]Chaosmagie - Carnivean[PARAGRAPH:1]Schöpfungsmagie - Majen (Elf)[PARAGRAPH:1]Todesmagie - Barbatos[PARAGRAPH:1]Dimensionsmagie - Os-Gabella[PARAGRAPH:1]Erdmagie - Jenkin[PARAGRAPH:1]Verzauberungsmagie - Velgyr[PARAGRAPH:1]Entropiemagie - Asmoday[PARAGRAPH:1]Feuermagie - Mikel Dylantyr[PARAGRAPH:1]Kraftmagie - Paimon[PARAGRAPH:1]Eismagie - Badb[PARAGRAPH:1]Ordnungsmagie - Soqed Hozi[PARAGRAPH:1]Lebensmagie - Leucetios[PARAGRAPH:1]Metamagie - Gastrius[PARAGRAPH:1]Geistesmagie - Perpentach[PARAGRAPH:1]Naturmagie - Herve[PARAGRAPH:1]Schattenmagie - Wode (Elf)[PARAGRAPH:1]Seelenmagie - Laroth (der sein eigenes Reich in der Unterwelt erschaffen würde)[PARAGRAPH:1]Sonnenmagie - Tamesis[PARAGRAPH:1]Wassermagie - Trenton Majosi (Aifon)[PARAGRAPH:2]Doch letztendlich begann Kylorin zu bedauern, was er dem Imperium und den Menschen angetan hatte und betete um Hilfe. Nantosuelta antwortete auf diese Gebete und lehrte ihn, ein noch mächtigerer Magier zu werden. Kylorin nutzte diese Macht, um eine Rebellion innerhalb seines eigenen Imperiums anzuführen. So machte er sich daran, jene Zauberer zu unterwerfen oder zu töten, die sich weigerten, von ihrem schändlichen Tun abzulassen, auch wenn einige seinen Säuberungen entkamen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Perpentach war ein Meister der Geistesmagie und einer der Lieblingsschüler von Kylorin. Kylorin war allerdings nicht gewillt, ihn zu töten, und sperrte ihn deshalb in einen Kerker im Palus (dem Turm der Augen) ein, der von nicht denkenden Golems bewacht wurde. Aber Perpentach war begabter, als Kylorin vermutet hatte, und deshalb in der Lage, sein Bewußtsein hinaus in die Welt zu schicken, weit weg von seinem Gefängnis. Mit einer Anstrengung, bei der er suchte, Illusionen erschuf und den Verstand einfacher Menschen kontrollierte, alles Kilometer entfernt von seinem Gefängnis, und die seinen Verstand so sehr unter Spannung setzte, dass dieser fast unter der Belastung zerbrach, gelang es ihm, Hunderte Männer zu seinem Gefängnis zu führen, die für ihn gegen die Golems kämpften und sie besiegten. Anschließend befreiten sie ihn und erklärten ihn zu ihrem Herrscher.[PARAGRAPH:2]Durch den immer noch wütenden Bürgerkrieg zerbrach das Imperium, in dem Kylorin die religiösen Kräfte des Guten gegen die Kreaturen und die unheilige Magie der alten Zauberer führte. Gegen Ende des Krieges waren 9 verschiedene Nationen der Menschen entstanden: die Elohim, Hüter der Geschichte und Wächter der heiligen Orte der Welt; die Bannor, Bewahrer des heiligen Feuers und die Erzfeinde der Zauberer; die Malakim, Wüstennomaden und Menschen des Glaubens; die Lanun, Händler und Seefahrer; die Hippus, Pferdefürsten und Söldner; die Grigori, Jünger von Cassiel; die Balseraph, angeführt vom Zauberer Perpentach; die Illianer, die in der Tundra und den verwüsteten Landstrichen hausten; und die Calabim, die inzwischen von Alexis und Flauros beherrscht wurden.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Schöpfung nahm ihre neue Gestalt an. Es gab zwar immer noch mächtige Übel in der Welt: Zauberer, die sich überall versteckten, und Monster, die die Wildnis durchstreiften, jetzt wo ihre Meister tot waren. Es gab aber auch viele Aufgaben für Abenteurer, die gewillt waren, verlorene Artefakte wiederzufinden oder verborgene Gegenden zu erkunden. Und es gab Kriege.[PARAGRAPH:2]Genau während dieser Zeit begab sich der Aifon Trenton Majosi auf eine Suche, um sein Volk zu retten. Er kehrte mit der einzig möglichen Rettung zurück, einem Ritual, das Danalin erlauben würde, die Schöpfung zu betreten und seine Kinder zu retten. Doch um den Krieg der Götter nicht erneut zu entfachen, verzichtete Trenton auf die Durchführung des Rituals und so wurden die Aifon und Trenton ausgelöscht. Der Verlust seiner Kinder in der Schöpfung leitete Danalins Rückzug aus dem Reigen der Götter ein, indem er in einen tiefen Schlaf fiel, aus dem er bis heute nicht erwacht ist.[PARAGRAPH:2]Agares, der erste Gefallene, bearbeitete mit seinen Einflüsterungen Bhall, den Engel des Feuers, und schließlich verfiel sie seinen Worten. Dies läutete das Ende des Zeitalters der Magie ein. Bhall stürzte vom Himmel und in dieser Nacht regnete es Feuer. Die Menschen, die ihr treu ergeben waren, wurden in abscheuliche orkische Rassen verwandelt, die sich später zum Klan der Asche zusammenschlossen. Die Hauptstadt des Reichs der Bannor, in der ihr größter Tempel stand, stürzte mit ihr in die Hölle.[PARAGRAPH:2]Derweil hatte das Ritual, das von Trenton Majosi entdeckt worden war, seinen Weg in die Hände der Illianer gefunden. Sie fürchteten einen erneuten Krieg der Götter nicht, da Bhall dafür verantwortlich war, das Gegengewicht zu ihrem Schutzgott Mulcarn zu bilden. Nun da Bhall gestürzt war, hatte ihr Herr keinen Gegenspieler mehr und dieses besitzlose Volk sah eine Möglichkeit, sich mehr als nur die Reste einzuverleiben, die ihnen vom Rest der Menschheit übrig gelassen wurden.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Welt stand in Flammen, und obwohl viele Seher und Propheten den Beginn des Rituals sofort bemerkten, konnten es sich nur wenige Reiche leisten, Armeen zu entbehren, die das gerade durchgeführte Ritual stoppen sollten. Nur die Luchuirp stellten eine Armee auf. Sie waren Golemkonstrukteure, weshalb ihrer Armee die brennenden Nahrungsvorräte weniger ausmachten als anderen Nationen. Die Luchuirp bestürmten die illianische Hauptstadt mit der ganzen Macht ihrer Kampfmaschinen, aber sie kamen zu spät. Gerade als sie die Stadtmauern durchbrachen, betrat Mulcarn die Schöpfung und löschte die Armee der Luchuirp mit einem leisen Flüstern aus.[PARAGRAPH:2]So setzte ein dauerhafter Winter überall in der Schöpfung ein.[PARAGRAPH:2][H1]Das Zeitalter des Eises[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]Die Götter selbst sahen diese Aktion als einen Bruch des Paktes an. Allerdings waren sie nicht gewillt, erneut einen Krieg der Götter zu beginnen, auch wenn sie nicht zulassen konnten, dass Mulcarn die Schöpfung völlig unbehelligt betrat. Sie kamen überein, einen Gott in die Schöpfung zu schicken, der Mulcarn bekämpfen sollte. Dieser Gott war Sucellus, der Gott der Natur.[PARAGRAPH:2]So betrat Sucellus die Schöpfung und kämpfte mit Mulcarn. Zur selben Zeit wanden sich die Ljosalfar gegeneinander. Ein Abkommen sah vor, dass die Macht im Reich zwischen zwei Königinen aufgeteilt wurde, eine sollte während des Sommers regieren und die andere während des Winters. Die Winterkönigin hielt daher jahrelang an der Herrschaft fest, da der Winter keine Anzeichen machte, vorbei zu gehen, und sie sich deshalb weigerte, den Thron abzugeben. Aus diesem Streit erwuchs ein Bürgerkrieg und die Elfen, die treu zur Winterkönigin standen, spalteten sich ab und nannten sich fortan Svartalfar.[PARAGRAPH:2]Währenddessen verlor Sucellus seinen Kampf und wurde von Mulcarn getötet. Die Oberfläche der Schöpfung gefror nun immer weiter und die Elfen waren gezwungen, ihren Bürgerkrieg zu vertagen, da sie nicht länger in der Lage waren, Armeen aufzustellen oder zu marschieren. Sie versuchten, geschützte Plätze in der Welt zu finden, an denen sie bleiben konnten, und warteten auf das Ende des Winters, um ihren Krieg fortsetzen zu können.[PARAGRAPH:2]Auch die Reiche der Menschen wurden von den Schneestürmen und der Macht Mulcarns hinweg gefegt. Einige wenige verstreute Stämme überlebten, doch sogar jene waren wenig mehr als Tiere, die am Rande des Überlebens vegetierten. All die Fortschritte des Zeitalters der Magie gingen verloren.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Illianer selbst lebten zwar besser als die meisten anderen, aber ihr Gott hatte nur wenig Mitleid übrig, so dass sogar sie gezwungen waren, auf einige grundlegende Annehmlichkeiten oder Technologien zu verzichten, um sich den unbeugsamen Willen von Mulcarn zu erhalten.[PARAGRAPH:2]Einige Stämme versammelten sich und begründeten eine neue Zivilisation, die Doviello. Diese Menschen machten sich ihr animalisches Wesen zu eigen und wurden so mehr zu einem Rudel Wölfe als einer Gemeinschaft von Menschen. Sie hatten einen gewissen Nutzen für Mulcarn, da sie andere Stämme jagten und auslöschten und die Bestrebungen der Illianer nicht störten. Außerdem zeigten sie wenig Interesse an Fortschritt und Veränderung, die Mulcarn beide verabscheute, weshalb ihnen erlaubt war, weiter zu existieren.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ein Flecken von Erebus erhielt jedoch eine Ruhepause vom ewigen Winter. In dem feurigen Abgrund, wo einst der Bhall geweihte Tempel in den Himmel geragt hatte, loderte noch ein kleiner Teil ihres Wesens, der den Orks Schutz bot und diese dort wachsen und gedeihen ließ. Währenddessen sahen sich ihre in der Hölle gefangenen einstigen Blutsbrüder, die Bannor, einem permanenten Überlebenskampf ausgesetzt. Junil, der ihre Verbissenheit bewunderte, schickte seinen Erzengel Sabathiel, um sie dort hinauszuführen. Erst spät im Zeitalter des Eises erreichten sie die Oberfläche, genau im Herzen des orkischen Hoheitsgebiets, wodurch sich eine Rivalität entzündete, die für Generationen anhielt.[PARAGRAPH:2]Die Schöpfung wäre vielleicht für immer so geblieben, wäre Kylorin nicht zurückgekommen. Er versammelte die verstreuten Stämme unter einem Banner und nannte dieses neue Volk die Amuriten. Er schmiedete die zerbrochenen Teile des Gottesschlächters erneut zusammen und nahm ihn mit in den Kampf gegen Mulcarn. In diesem epischen Kampf tötete Kylorin Mulcarn und beendete so das Zeitalter des Eises.[PARAGRAPH:2][H1]Das Zeitalter der Wiedergeburt[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]Nach dem Tod des Gottes des Winters wurde Sucellus wiedergeboren, nun als der Gott des Lebens. Zum ersten Mal beschritt ein Gott die Wege zwischen der Unterwelt und der Schöpfung, wodurch einige Türen zwischen diesen beiden Welten geöffnet wurden. Durch eine dieser Türen konnte eine Gruppe Elfen entkommen, die vor langer Zeit in den Kerker von Laroth verschleppt wurden. Sie brachten einige gestohlene Bücher mit, die Laroths Studien der Unterwelt enthielten. Eines davon würde von Sandalphon verwendet werden, um einigen Menschen beizubringen, wie sie zu "Schemen" werden könnten, wodurch die Sidar entstünden.[PARAGRAPH:2]Ähnlich wie die Doviello im vergangenen Zeitalter, begannen sich Menschen verschiedener Stämme wieder unter einem dunklen Banner zu sammeln. Dieses Mal folgten sie dem Ruf für Versprechungen über magische Kräfte. Sie wurden von Tebryn Arbandi und Os-Gabella angeführt und die Sheaïm genannt, mächtige Beschwörer, die ihre Geheimnisse offen teilen.[PARAGRAPH:2]Außerdem drang Hastur, Erzengel von Mammon, in die feuchte Kammer von Danalin ein. Da er den Gott immer noch schlafend vorfand, begann Hastur mit seinen Einflüsterungen, die bei Danalin Alpträume verursachten, welche sich nun in der Schöpfung wiederfinden.</German>
		<Italian>[H1]The Birth of Time[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the beginning there was the One creator. Such was his power that all he spoke and thought was Truth. When first he spoke he made a place of glory and a throne from which he could sit and view all of his creation. This place he named Heaven and his throne was called Order. The One spoke of a blue orb that rested on the arm of his throne. This orb he named Temporance and to it was given the power to control the flow of time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]The Time of Angels[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was now that the One began to speak of new creations. Each one he created he gave a unique name and the twin gifts of life and free will. Each creation was created differently but to the whole he gave the name Angels. There were 21 angels created and each was appointed to be the head of a divine precept.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Each Angel was made to serve the One and to serve the creations that would come after. For the first time other voices were heard as they began to sing and praise the One.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Angel were:[NEWLINE][TAB]Lugus- Angel of Light[NEWLINE][TAB]Sirona- Angel of Wisdom[NEWLINE][TAB]Bhall- Angel of Fire[NEWLINE][TAB]Nantosuelta- Angel of Faith[NEWLINE][TAB]Nemed- Angel of Life[NEWLINE][TAB]Amathaon- Angel of Fertility[NEWLINE][TAB]Junil- Angel of Justice[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Arawn- Angel of Death[NEWLINE][TAB]Oghma- Angel of Knowledge[NEWLINE][TAB]Danalin- Angel of the Water[NEWLINE][TAB]Dagda- Angel of Balance[NEWLINE][TAB]Kilmorph- Angel of the Earth[NEWLINE][TAB]Sucellus- Angel of Nature[NEWLINE][TAB]Tali- Angel of the Air[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Camulos- Angel of Peace, who would become the Angel of War[NEWLINE][TAB]Aeron- Angel of Strength, who would become the Angel of Rage[NEWLINE][TAB]Ceridwen- Angel of the Stars, who would become the Angel of Magic[NEWLINE][TAB]Mammon- Angel of Foresight, who would become the Angel of Greed[NEWLINE][TAB]Esus- Angel of Trust, who would become the Angel of Deception[NEWLINE][TAB]Mulcarn- Angel of Ice, who would become the Angel of Winter[NEWLINE][TAB]Agares- Angel of Hope, who would become the Angel of Despair[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]The Birth of Man[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Heaven was full of many wonders which the angels spent centuries studying and praising. When the One felt them ready he commanded them to take flight outside the boundaries and to fill the vacuum with creations that mirror those of Heaven. He gave them the power of creation. So the angels set off in every direction, creating as it pleased them to create a host of worlds true and good that would serve the One.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When the creation was done there was a variety of worlds and a nearly endless array of life upon them. Each angel created a world in their own preference and all the angels contributed to a common world, called Erebus, which was their greatest creation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Although all manner of life and substance had been created in the world the angels wished to create something greater than their individual aspects. Together they agreed to create a race of men that would contain a gift from each of them. This race would be directly descended from the angels and Nemed agreed to sacrifice his precept and become the father of this new race. His precept, that of Life, was given over to Arawn and the angels created an immortal female named Gabella to serve as his wife.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The one entered creation where he stood upon a white stone slab and viewed all things. Seeing this work as good the One took back the power of creation from the angels.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]The Fall of Agares[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unknown to the other angels, and some say even to the One himself, Agares was not willing to lose the power of creation. Knowing he could not hope to keep the power from being taken from him and that he would be left only with the power to manipulate what already existed he used the power while he had it to create infinite wells of raw elements, air, earth, fire, water, life and death. At the center of these infinite reaches he placed gems of each of these elements which he had secreted out of heaven itself. When the power of creation was lost to him he still had enough matter and energy that he could go on creating until the end of time.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once the power of creation was gone to him he continued creating in his own world, which he called Nyx, with his infinite plains of elements. He created Nyx not in the fashion of heaven but as he desired. The creatures of this world were not told of other angel's or the One, and Agares commanded they worship him alone. Nyx was a world painted in black and gold, a shadowy reflection of heaven, where the precept of hope controlled every aspect. Dreams, desire, worship and want ruled the shallow creatures that inhabited the beautiful world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The other angels noticed that Agares continued creating. Agares claimed that it was cruel to take the power of creation away from them and that the One was jealous that their creations had outshone heaven itself. Six angels sided with Agares as they were eager to regain the power of creation and he showed them his infinite wells and how to use them to create. These angels were Camulos, Aeron, Ceridwen, Mammon, Esus and Mulcarn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was then that the One intervened. Seeing Agares' blasphemy he sought to remove it from all of creation. By this point however Agares' taint had spread through all of creation, nothing existed that would still exist if he removed the evil from it. Unwilling to destroy creation the One condemned all the Angels out of Heaven, to live among creation until the day he returns to separate the good from the evil. The One tasked the angels still loyal to him with protecting creation and guiding it toward enlightenment until the day he returned.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Those angels that followed Agares opposed the One's decree and took up arms against the angels loyal to him. From this point on the angels that fell were known as Evil by men, those that opposed them and were charged with protecting mankind were known as good and the 7 tasked with maintaining the functions of creations besides man were known as the angels of Neutrality.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After throwing all of the angels from Heaven the One sundered the path between Heaven and Creation so that none but him could pass between them. In response to this all the angels, except Agares, created a host of new angels to serve them. The first they created was their archangel, and behind them thousands more to spread their will across creation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The archangels were:[NEWLINE][TAB]Amathaon- Maponos the Young[NEWLINE][TAB]Sucellus- Cernunnos[NEWLINE][TAB]Bhall- Brigit the Shining[NEWLINE][TAB]Kilmorph- Goibniu[NEWLINE][TAB]Lugus- Baelious ("fortune")[NEWLINE][TAB]Aeron- Odio (who was imprisoned by Kilmorph during the age of dragons)[NEWLINE][TAB]Dagda- Cassiel[NEWLINE][TAB]Mammon- Hastur, Lord of Nightmares[NEWLINE][TAB]Junil- Sabathiel[NEWLINE][TAB]Oghma- Embarr ("imagination")[NEWLINE][TAB]Camulos- The Avatar of Wrath[NEWLINE][TAB]Nantosuelta- Splendor[NEWLINE][TAB]Ceridwen- Kanna, Mistress of Pain[NEWLINE][TAB]Sirona- Pelian the Suffering[NEWLINE][TAB]Esus- Iaegus[NEWLINE][TAB]Tali- Leucetious (Bringer of Storms)[NEWLINE][TAB]Arawn- Gyra and Basium (the twins)[NEWLINE][TAB]Danalin- Condatis[NEWLINE][TAB]Mulcarn- Taranis the Unchanging[NEWLINE][TAB]Agares- None (until the later creation of Hyborem, Lord of the Balors)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But Agares, not satisfied to play the Ones game, did the opposite. He returned to Nyx and destroyed everything there, every creature he had created, every monument that had been built. In one burst of power the beautiful world of Nyx was reduced to ash. The world lies to this day barren, it is called the deepest hell and none would suspect that it was once a world of surprising life.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Creation[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the beginning all manner of natural animals and plants existed in creation, much as in our world.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gabella mirrored the rebellion of Agares by refusing to endure her role as a subordinate to man. She fled from Nemed and retreated to the Bair of Lacuna. Further generations of men have the gift of immortality removed from them. But still their divine birthright makes their soul immortal, even if their body fails. It is this connection to the divine, through the angel of Nemed, that allows men to channel the power of the angels and allows their souls to pass to them when they die.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the 6th generation of men Os-Gabella returned and stole two children, Alexis and Flauros to raise as her own. These children become the first vampires, killing others to sustain their life throughout the ages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Age of Dragons[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unable to overcome their differences the gods begin to war across creation. As in all things the gods desires become physically manifested and their aggression was acted out by powerful creatures that battle against each other. Dragons, giants, great elementals and the gods themselves unleashed incredible magic and threaten to destroy creation with it. Mountains are created and destroyed, chasms and lakes were created like gaping scars.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During this time hundreds of angels succumbed to the whispers of Agares. These fell from the service to the angel that had created them. To this day Agares has more angels in his service than any other angel, but none of them were created by his hand. Even his archangel, Hyborem, is a corruption of another.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cernunnos, the great horned one, was the archangel of Sucellus. He dared to attack Agares directly. Agares picked up the powerful archangel and showed him visions of himself dark and corrupted. So powerful was the vision that it became real, splitting Cernunnos into two creatures. They were identical in form but the new creature, which Agares named Hyborem, was dark in aspect and colored in blood. Hyborem and Cernunnos fought but neither could defeat the other. As such, even the archangel of Agares was stolen from another, he is a perversion of the natural.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sucellus and Danalin remain largely out of the fighting. Instead each tends to a group of men that venerate them and that become changed by the close presence of their god. For Sucellus these men become the Ljosalfar, elves born to nature. For Danalin these men become the Aifons, men who can breathe water as well as air.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mankind, the greatest pride of the gods, was almost threatened with extinction. Immanuel Logos, a tribal leader, began the order of the Elohim at the close of this age to care for those injured in the Godswar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When it becomes obvious that the gods battle threatens creation itself Dagda calls for the war to end. The gods meet and the compact is formed, an agreement that the gods would withdraw and only interfere with creation through certain limited means. The Godslayer is formed as a physical manifestation of that agreement, a weapon capable of killing any god.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For some the compact does too much. Basium, the archangel of Arawn, rebels and continues his battle against the Infernals regardless of the compact. For others it does to little. Cassiel, the archangel of Dagda, rebels believing that the gods should withdrawal completely from creation instead of using men to fight their battles for them. Cassiel enters creation to teach men to ignore the will of the gods.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Age of Magic[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Without the destruction of the Godswar man is able to form civilizations. One empire of men is created, Patria, and the people learn from and trade with the Ljosalfar and the Aifons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Patrian nation becomes strong. Basium's battles are mostly in hell, Cassiel is revered among the Patrians who are more philosophical than religious. The children of Os-Gabella, who have learned to leech life from others to sustain their own, are a scourge to mankind and the only real predators to humanity. It is the most peaceful time in mans existence.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During this time Kheldon Ki sculpts the dwarves from his prison home and they are given life by Kilmorph. They tunnel out over a few generations, exploring the underworld. They settle on hills near the human lands. After abuse by corrupt Patrian merchants, many will retreat back to their tunnels, forming the unified nation of the Khazad. Other tribes stay on the surface, creating the Luchuirp, open-sky Dwarves.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kylorin becomes the king of the Patrians. He is a wise and popular ruler, loved by his people. When his wife betrays him Kylorin considers suicide by jumping from the top of his palace. Ceridwen, queen of pain, talks to him there, offering him another deal. That she will give Kylorin eternal youth and have his wife be resurrected in a new form each time she dies so that he may find and remarry her without the memory of her betrayal. The price is that Kylorin will worship Ceridwen and lead the Patrians according to her desires. Kylorin agrees.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ceridwen gifts Kylorin with eternal youth and teaches him magic. He becomes the first archmage and begins teaching others how to use magic to enforce his ever more corrupt rule over Patria. In a few generations his rule is absolute and vile. Sorcerers practice bizarre experiments, creating creatures like manticores, chimera and trolls and rule the fiefdoms in their control as gods. Kylorin directly trains 21 students and puts each in charge of a separate magical school.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These were the names of Kylorin's students:[NEWLINE][TAB]Air- Greysun[NEWLINE][TAB]Body- Kezef (whose experiments killed all the animals on the Grigi plains)[NEWLINE][TAB]Chaos- Carnivean[NEWLINE][TAB]Creation- Majen (elven)[NEWLINE][TAB]Death- Barbatos[NEWLINE][TAB]Dimensional- Os-Gabella[NEWLINE][TAB]Earth- Jenkin[NEWLINE][TAB]Enchantment- Velgyr[NEWLINE][TAB]Entropy- Asmoday[NEWLINE][TAB]Fire- Mikel Dylantyr[NEWLINE][TAB]Force- Paimon[NEWLINE][TAB]Ice- Badb[NEWLINE][TAB]Law- Soqed Hozi[NEWLINE][TAB]Life- Leucetios[NEWLINE][TAB]Metamagic- Gastrius[NEWLINE][TAB]Mind- Perpentach[NEWLINE][TAB]Nature- Herve[NEWLINE][TAB]Shadow- Wode (elven)[NEWLINE][TAB]Spirit- Laroth (who would create his own empire in the underworld)[NEWLINE][TAB]Sun- Tamesis[NEWLINE][TAB]Water- Trenton Majosi (aifon)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kylorin eventually becomes regretful of what he has done to the empire of men and prays for help. Nantosuelta answers those prayers and teaches him how to be an even more powerful mage. Kylorin uses that power to lead a rebellion in his own empire. He sets about subduing or killing those sorcerers who refuse to repent, though some escape his purge.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perpentach was a master of mind magic, and a favored student of Kylorin. Kylorin was unwilling to kill him, imprisoning him instead in a dungeon in the Palus (the Tower of Eyes), guarded by unthinking golems. But Perpentach was more talented than Kylorin suspected, and was able to send his consciousness out wandering further and further from his prison. Searching, creating illusions and controlling minds miles from the dungeon in a process that strained him to the point of fracturing his mind. But he drew hundreds of men to his prison, made them fight and defeat the golems, release him, and declare him their ruler.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The war splinters the empire with Kylorin leading good religious forces against the creations and unholy magic of the sorcerers. By the end 9 human nations have been formed; the Elohim keepers of memories and guardians of the sacred parts of the world; the Bannor, keepers of the sacred fire and the greatest enemies of the sorcerers; the Malakim, desert nomads and men of faith; the Lanun, traders and seamen; the Hippus; horse lords and mercenary's; the Grigori, followers of Cassiel; the Balseraphs, lead by the sorcerer Perpentach; the Illians, who dwelt in the tundra and ravaged lands; and the Calabim, who became ruled by Alexis and Flauros.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Creation settled into its new form. There were still many powerful evils in the world. Sorcerers who still hid in the land and monsters who roamed the wilderness now that their masters were dead. There were many jobs for adventurers willing to recover lost artifacts or investigate hidden areas. And there were wars.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was during this age that the Aifon Trenton Majosi set out on a quest to save his people. He returned with the only salvation possible, a ritual that would allow Danalin to enter creation and save his children. Rather than return to the Godswar Trenton didn't perform the ritual and the Aifons and Trenton were destroyed. The loss of his children from creation caused Danalin to withdraw, falling into a sleep from which he hasn't yet woken.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Agares, the first to fall, whispered to Bhall, the angel of fire, and she eventually succumbed to his words. This was the end of the age of magic. Bhall fell from heaven and that night the sky rained fire. Men loyal to her were transformed into hideous orcish races, becoming the Clan of Embers. The capital of the Bannor empire, which held her greatest temple, dropped with her into hell.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The ritual uncovered by Trenton Majosi had found its way into the Illians hands. They had no fear of a Godswar, since Bhall was responsible for opposing their patron deity Mulcarn. With Bhall fallen their lord was unopposed, and this dispossessed people saw an opportunity to have more than the scraps left for them by the rest of humanity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The world was on fire and although many seers and prophets immediately knew when the ritual began few empires could afford to send armies to stop the ritual that was being performed. Only a the Luchuirp rallied an army. They were golem makers so the burning food supplies didn't affect their army as strongly as other nations. The Luchuirp assailed the Illian capital with the full force of their battle machines, but they were too late. Just as they broke through the city walls Mulcarn entered creation and with a whisper the Luchuirp army was wiped out.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A permanent winter set in across creation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Age of Ice[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The gods considered this breaking of the compact. They were unwilling to restart the Godswar, but couldn't let Mulcarn move into creation unchallenged. They agreed to let one god go into creation to fight Mulcarn. That god was Sucellus, the god of nature.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sucellus entered creation and battled with Mulcarn. At the same time the Ljosalfar turned on themselves. They had agreed to shared power between two queens, one to rule during summer and the other during winter. The winter queen claimed dominance for years as winter showed no signs of ending and refused to give up the throne. This argument created a civil war and the new branch loyal to the winter queen called themselves the Svartalfar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sucellus lost the battle and was killed by Mulcarn. Creation froze even further and the elves were forced to stop their civil war as they could no longer mobilize armies or travel. They tried to find hidden places in the world to remain, and waited for the winter to end to continue their war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The empires of man were crushed by the blizzards and the power of Mulcarn. A few scattered tribes remained, but even these were little more than animals on the edge of survival. All the advancement of the Age of Magic was lost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Illians themselves lived better than most, but their god had little compassion and even they were forced to forgo basic conveniences or technology to maintain the unchanging will of Mulcarn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Some tribes gathered together into a new civilization, the Doviello. These men embraced their bestial nature and became more like a pack of wolves then men. They served a use to Mulcarn, by hunting and killing other tribes, and not interfering with the actions of the Illians. And they had little interest in the advancement and change that Mulcarn abhorred so they were allowed to remain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One corner of Erebus held a respite from the winter. The fiery pit that had been the temple dedicated to Bhall held a small portion of her essence, and so continued to burn, giving shelter to the orcs, who prospered in their corner of the world. Meanwhile their kin the Bannor, trapped in Hell, faced a constant struggle for survival. Junil, admiring their determination, sent his Archangel Sabathiel to lead them out. They emerged late in the Age of Ice, in the heart of the orcish territory, sparking a rivalry that persisted for generations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Creation would have remained indefinitely like this had Kylorin not returned. He gathered the scattered tribes of men under one banner, naming them the Amurites. He reforged the broken pieces of the Godslayer and took it into battle against Mulcarn, killing him and ending the Age of Ice.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]GODSLAYER[\H1][PARAGRAPH:2]I was born to end an age of destruction. Dragons, angels, leviathans, the mighty armies of the gods clashed as they struggled for advantage. Below, the earth trembled, and man was locked into a terrifying existence he could not hope to comprehend.[PARAGRAPH:1]The gods agreed on but one thing--that should they continue their struggle in the same vein or all their work would be lost. The spoils of their war, those sentient beings born of their cooperation at the time of creation, would be destroyed if an agreement was not made.[PARAGRAPH:1]So they came, one by one, to the Seven Pines from the distant corners of Erebus, until all 21 were assembled. The agreement was made, spelled out to the letter. I was the manifest symbol of that covenant, and its enforcement. The Godslayer.[PARAGRAPH:1]The oath each god made in turn bound their fate to me. As they spoke their agreement, their name became etched onto my surface. Then they left, never to set foot personally in creation again, on pain of death. I was left in the care of a human warrior.[PARAGRAPH:1]Centuries past. My purpose was forgotten--the Godslayer was used in battles and wars as any other blade. My pieces were split apart from misuse and by time, but my nature cannot be destroyed.[PARAGRAPH:2]Mulcarn breaks his vow! Take me to him, for he has forfeit his life, and is sentenced to die upon my blade! Take me to him![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Age of Rebirth[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the death of the god of winter Sucellus was reborn, now the god of life. For the first time a god passed between the underworld and creation and doorways were opened between these realms. Through one a group of living elves, pulled long ago into the Dungeon of Laroth, escaped. They brought with them some stolen tomes from Laroth's studies in the underworld. One of which would be used by Sandalphon to teach men to become shades and create the Sidar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Much like the Doviello of the prior age men from various tribes began to gather under a dark banner. This time they are responding to a promise of arcane power. Lead by Tebryn Arbandi and Os-Gabella they are called the Sheaim, powerful summoners who share their secrets openly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Lastly Hastur, archangel of Mammon, invades the watery vault of Danalin. Finding the god still sleeping Hastur begins whispering to him, causing nightmares that are reflected in creation.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[H1]El Nacimiento del Tiempo[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Al principio estaba el Único creador.  Tal era su poder que todo lo que dijo y pensó fue Verdadero.  La primera vez que habló hizo un lugar glorioso y un trono desde el que observó sentado toda su creación.  Llamó a este lugar el Cielo y a su trono Orden.  El Único habló de un orbe azul que descansaba en el brazo de su trono.  Este orbe fue llamado Templanza y a él se le dio el poder de controlar el flujo del tiempo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]El Tiempo de los Ángeles[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fue entonces cuando el Único empezó a hablar de sus creaciones.  A cada uno que creó le dió un único nombre y los dones gemelos de la vida y el libre albedrío.  Cada creación fue creada diferente pero a todos les dió el nombre de Ángeles.  Habían 21 ángeles creados y a cada uno se le asignó un precepto divino.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cada Ángel fue creado para servir al Único y servir a las creaciones que vendría después.  Por primera vez otras voces fueron escuchadas según empezaban a cantar y a adorar al Único.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los Ángeles eran:[NEWLINE][TAB]Lugus- Ángel de la Luz[NEWLINE][TAB]Sirona- Ángel de la Sabiduría[NEWLINE][TAB]Bhall- Ángel del Fuego[NEWLINE][TAB]Nantosuelta- Ángel de la Fe[NEWLINE][TAB]Nemed- Ángel de la Vida[NEWLINE][TAB]Amateón- Ángel de la Fertilidad[NEWLINE][TAB]Junil- Ángel de la Justicia[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Arawn- Ángel de la Muerte[NEWLINE][TAB]Oghma- Ángel del Conocimiento[NEWLINE][TAB]Danalin- Ángel del Agua[NEWLINE][TAB]Dagda- Ángel del Equilibrio[NEWLINE][TAB]Kilmorph- Ángel de la Tierra[NEWLINE][TAB]Sucellus- Ángel de la Naturaleza[NEWLINE][TAB]Tali- Ángel del Aire[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB]Cámulos- Ángel de la Paz, quien se convertiría en el Ángel de la Guerra[NEWLINE][TAB]Aeron- Ángel de la Fuerza, quien se convertiría en el Ángel de la Furia[NEWLINE][TAB]Ceridwen- Ángel de las Estrellas, quien se convertiría en el Ángel de la Magia[NEWLINE][TAB]Mammon- Ángel de la Previsión, quien se convertiría en el Ángel de la Codicia[NEWLINE][TAB]Esus- Ángel de la Confianza, quien se convertiría en el Ángel del Engaño[NEWLINE][TAB]Mulcarn- Ángel del Hielo, quien se convertiría en el Ángel del Invierno[NEWLINE][TAB]Agares- Ángel de la Esperanza, el que sería el Ángel de la Desesperación[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]El Nacimiento del Hombre[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El Cielo estaba lleno de maravillas que los ángeles dedicaron centurias estudiando y admirando.  Cuando el Único sintió que estaban listos los lideró para volar fuera de los límites y llenar el vacío con creaciones que se reflejaran a aquellas del Cielo.  Él les entregó el poder de la creación.  Entonces los ángeles se dirigieron en todas direcciones, creando como les gustaba crear un sinnúmero de mundos de verdad y bondad que servirían al Único.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cuando la creación estuvo hecha había toda una variedad de mundos y casi una infinidad de vida en ellos.  Cada ángel creó un mundo a su gusto, y todos los ángeles contribuyeron en la creación de un mundo común, llamado Erebus, que fue su mayor creación.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aunque toda forma de vida y sustancia fue creada en el mundo, los ángeles quisieron crear algo más grande que sus aspectos individuales.  Juntos se pudieron de acuerdo en crear una raza de hombres que contendría un don de cada uno de ellos.  Esta raza descendería directamente de los ángeles y Nemed accedió a sacrificar su precepto y convertirse en el padre de esta nueva raza.  Su precepto, el de la Vida, fue entregado a Arawn y los ángeles crearon una mujer inmortal llamada Gabella para servir como su esposa.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El único entró en la creación en la que se mantuvo de pie sobre un eslabón piedra blanca y vió todas las cosas.  Viendo este trabajo tan bien hecho, el Único recogió de los ángeles el don de la creación.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]La Caída de Agares[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sin que los otros ángeles lo supieran, y algunos incluso dicen que tampoco el mismísimo Único, Agares no deseó perder el poder de la creación.  Sabiendo que no podía esperar mantener el poder sin que se le fuera arrebatado y que le dejarían sólo con el poder de manipular lo que ya existía, utilizó el poder mientras lo tuvo para crear pozos infinitos de elementos brutos, aire, tierra, fuego, agua, vida y muerte.  En el centro de estos lugares infinitos colocó gemas de cada elemento que mantuvo en secreto del mismo cielo.  Cuando el poder de la creación dejó de estar en él, Agares aún tenía suficiente materia y energía que podría utilizar para seguir creando hasta el final de los tiempos.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Una vez que perdió la creación él continuó creando su propio mundo, al que llamó Nyx, con sus infinitos planos de elementos.  Creó Nyx no al estilo del Cielo sino del que él deseaba.  Las criaturas de este mundo no fueron advertidas por los otros ángeles o por el Único, y Agares les ordenó que le obedecieran y adoraran sólo a él.  Nyx fue un mundo pintado de negro y oro, un reflejo sombrío del cielo, donde el precepto de la esperanza gobernó cada aspecto.  Sueños, deseo, adoración y querencia gobernaron a las frívolas criaturas que habitaban el precioso mundo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los otros ángeles se percataron de que Agares seguía creando.  Agares aclamó que fue cruel arrebatarles el poder de la creación lejos de ellos y que el Único estaba celoso de que las creaciones de los ángeles habían eclipsado al mismo cielo.  Seis ángeles se unieron a Agares, pues estaban deseosos de recuperar el poder de la creación, y les enseñó sus pozos infinitos y cómo usarlos para crear.  Estos Ángeles eran Cámulo, Aeron, Ceridwen, Mammon, Esus y Mulcarn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fue entonces cuando el Único intervino.  Viendo las blasfemias de Agares susurró para eliminarlas de toda la creación.  Sin embargo, en este punto la mancha de Agares ya se había extendido por toda la creación, nada existía que pudiera seguir existiendo si eliminara el mal de él.  No deseoso de destruir la creación, el Único condenó a todos los Ángeles a irse del Cielo, para vivir en la creación hasta que el día que volviera para separar el bien del mal.  El Único dió a los ángeles aún leales a él el objetivo de proteger la creación y llevarla a la iluminación hasta el día en el que el volviera.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aquellos ángeles que siguieron a Agares se opusieron al decreto del Único y se levantaron en armas contra los ángeles leales a él.  Desde este punto los ángeles que cayeron fueron conocidos como Malvados por los hombres, aquellos que se les opusieron y se les fue encargados de proteger a la humanidad fueron conocidos como Buenos, y los 7 encargados de mantener las funciones de la creación junto a los hombres fueron conocidos como los ángeles de la Neutralidad[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Después de expulsar a todos los ángeles del cielo, el Único cortó el paso entre el Cielo y la Creación para que ninguno a parte de él pudiera pasar entre ellos.  En respuesta a esto, todos los ángeles excepto Agares crearon un conjunto de nuevos ángeles para servirles.  El primero que crearon fue su arcángel, y por debajo de ellos miles más para extender su voluntad por toda la creación.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los arcángeles eran:[NEWLINE][TAB]Amateón- Máponos el Jóven[NEWLINE][TAB]Sucellus- Cernunnos[NEWLINE][TAB]Bhall- Brigit la Brillante[NEWLINE][TAB]Kilmorph- Goibniu[NEWLINE][TAB]Lugus- Baelio ("fortuna")[NEWLINE][TAB]Aeron- Odio (que fue aprisionado por Kilmorph durante la edad de los dragones)[NEWLINE][TAB]Dagda- Cassiel[NEWLINE][TAB]Mammon- Hastur, Señor de las Pesadillas[NEWLINE][TAB]Junil- Sabathiel[NEWLINE][TAB]Oghma- Embarr ("imaginación")[NEWLINE][TAB]Cámulo- El Avatar de la Ira[NEWLINE][TAB]Nantosuelta- Esplendor[NEWLINE][TAB]Ceridwen- Kanna, Señora del Dolor[NEWLINE][TAB]Sirona- Pelian el Sufridor[NEWLINE][TAB]Esus- Iaegus[NEWLINE][TAB]Tali- Leucetio (Heraldo de las Tormentas)[NEWLINE][TAB]Arawn- Gyra and Basium (los mellizos)[NEWLINE][TAB]Danalin- Condatis[NEWLINE][TAB]Mulcarn- Taranis el Inmutable[NEWLINE][TAB]Agares- Ninguno (hasta que más tarde crea a Hyborem, Señor de los Balors)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Pero Agares, sin ganas de jugar el juego del Único, hizo lo contrario.  Volvió a Nyx y destruyó todo en él, cada criatura que creó, cada monumento que fue levantado.  De un solo estallido de poder el hermoso mundo de Nyx fue reducido a cenizas.  Hoy día el mundo yace estéril, se le llama el más profundo infierno y ninguno sospecharía que una vez hubo vida allí, y rebosante.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Creación[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Al principio toda clase de animales y plantas existían en la creación, tanta como en nuestro mundo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gabella apoyó la rebelión de Agares rechazando alargar más su rol como una subordinada del hombre. Se alejó de Nemed y se retiró a Bair de Lacuna. Las siguientes generaciones de los hombres perdieron el don de la inmortalidad.  Pero aún así su derecho de nacimiento divino hace sus almas inmortales, incluso si sus cuerpos fallan.  Es la conexión con lo divino, a través del ángel Nemed, que a los hombres se les permite canalizar el poder de los ángeles y permite a sus almas pasar a ellos cuando mueran.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En la sexta generación de los hombres Os-Gabella volvió y robó dos hijos, Alexis y Flauros, para que crecieran como suyos propios. Estos niños se convirtieron en los primeros vampiros, matando a otros para mantener su vida a lo largo de los años.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]La Edad de los Dragones[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Incapaces de superar sus diferencias, los dioses empezaron a guerrear por toda la creación. Como todas las cosas los deseos de los dioses se manifestaron físicamente y sus agresiones fueron llevadas a cabo por poderosas criaturas que lucharon unas con otras. Dragones, gigantes, grandes elementales y los mismos dioses desataron un poder mágico increible y amenazaron con destruir la creación con él. Montañas con creadas y destruidas, abismos y lagos eran creados como cicatrices profundas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En este tiempo cientos de ángeles sucumbieron a los susurros de Agares.  Estos cayeron del servicio del ángel que los había creado al servicio de Agares.  A este día Agares tiene más ángeles a su servicio que ningún otro ángel, pero ninguno de ellos fueron creados por su mano.  Incluso su arcángel Hyborem es una corrupción de otro ángel.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cernunnos, el de los grandes cuernos, era el arcángel de Sucellus.  Pretendió atacar a Agares directamente.  Agares cogío al poderoso arcángel y le mostró visiones de sí mismo oscuro y corrupto.  Tan poderosa fue la visión que se hizo real, dividiendo a Cernunnos en dos criaturas.  Eran idénticas en su forma, pero la nueva criatura, a la que Agares llamó Hyborem, era oscura de aspecto y del color de la sangre.  Hyborem y Cernunnos lucharon pero ninguno pudo vencer al otro.  Como tal, incluso por ser el arcángel de Agares, que fue robado de otro, es una perversión de lo natural.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sucellus y Danalin permanecen mucho tiempo al margen de la lucha. En lugar de eso cada uno atiende a un grupo de hombres que les veneran y son cambiados por la cercana presencia de los dioses. Los hombres de Sucellus se convirtieron en los Ljosalfar, elfos nacidos de la naturaleza. Los de Danalin se convirtieron en los Aifons, hombres que pueden respirar tanto agua como aire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La Humanidad, el mayor orgullo de los dioses, fue amenazada casi hasta la extinción. Immanuel Logos, un líder tribal, empezó la orden de los Elohim al final de esta edad para cuidar de aquellos heridos por la Guerra de los Dioses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cuando se hace obvio que la batalla de los dioses amenazaba a la misma creación, Dagda llamó a un fin de la guerra. Los dioses se reunieron y la Concisión es firmada, un acuerdo de que los dioses se retirarían y que sólo interferirían con la creación hasta ciertos límites. La Matadioses es forjada como una manifestación física de ese acuerdo, un arma capaz de matar a cualquier dios.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Para algunos la concisión era demasiado. Basium, el arcángel de Arawn, se rebela y continúa su guerra contra los infernales a pesar de la concisión. Y para otros se quedaba corto. Cassiel, el arcángel de Dagda, se rebela creyendo que los dioses deberían retirarse por completo de la creación en lugar de utilizar a los hombres para que lucharan sus batallas por ellos. Cassiel entra en la creación para enseñar a los hombres a ignorar la voluntad de los dioses.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]La Edad de la Magia[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sin la destrucción de la Guerra de los Dioses, la humanidad es capaz de formar civilizaciones. Un imperio de los hombres es creado, Patria, y la gente aprende de y comercia con los Ljosalfar y los Aifons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La nación Patria se hizo fuerte. Las batallas de Basium eran mayormente en el infierno, Cassiel es reverenciado entre los Patrios, quienes son más filosóficos que religiosos. Los hijos de Os-Gabella, que han aprendido a absorver la vida de otros para sustentar la suya, son un azote para la humanidad, sus únicos verdaderos predadores. Esta es la época más pacífica en la existencia de la humanidad.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Durante este tiempo Kheldon Ki esculpe a los enanos desde su casa prisión y Kilmorph les da la vida. Hacen túneles durante unas pocas generaciones, explorando el inframundo. Se asentan en colinas cerca de las tierras de los humanos. Después de los abusos por mercantes Patrios corruptos, muchos se retirarían de vuelta a sus túneles, formando la nación unida de los Kazhad. Otras tribus se quedaron en la superficie, dando lugar a los Luchuirp, Enanos de cielo abierto.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kylorin se convierte en rey de los Patrios. Es un dirigente sabio y popular, amado por su pueblo. Cuando su mujer le traiciona, Kylorin considera el suicidio tirándose desde los alto de su palacio. Ceridwen, reina del delor, le habla allí, ofreciéndole otro trato. Ésta le daría a Kylorin joventud eterna y hacer que su mujer, cada vez que muriese, renaciera en una nueva forma para que él pudiera encontrarla y volver a casarse con ella sin el recuerdo de su traición. El precio a cambio era que Kylorin adoraría a Ceridwen y lideraría a los Patrios acorde a sus deseos. Kylorin aceptó.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ceridwen le da a Kylorin el don de la eterna juventud y también le enseña el camino de la magia. Se convierte en el primer archimago y empieza a enseñar a otros cómo utilizar la magia para reforzar su cada vez más corrupto gobierno sobre Patria. En unas pocas generaciones su gobierno es absoluto y vil. Los hechiceros practican experimentos bizarros, creando criaturas como son mantícoras, quimeras y trolls y gobiernan a los siervos bajo su control como dioses.  Kylorin entrena directamente a 21 estudiantes y pone a cada uno a cargo de una escuela de magia por separado.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Estos eran los nombres de los estudiantes de Kylorin:[NEWLINE][TAB]Aire- Greysun[NEWLINE][TAB]Cuerpo- Kezef (cuyos experimentos mató a todos los animales de los planos Grigi)[NEWLINE][TAB]Caos- Carniveo[NEWLINE][TAB]Creación- Majen (elfo)[NEWLINE][TAB]Muerte- Barbatos[NEWLINE][TAB]Dimensional- Os-Gabella[NEWLINE][TAB]Tierra- Jenkin[NEWLINE][TAB]Encantamiento- Velgyr[NEWLINE][TAB]Entropía- Asmoday[NEWLINE][TAB]Fuego- Mikel Dylantyr[NEWLINE][TAB]Fuerza- Paimon[NEWLINE][TAB]Hielo- Badb[NEWLINE][TAB]Ley- Soqed Hozi[NEWLINE][TAB]Vida- Leucetio[NEWLINE][TAB]Metamagia- Gastrius[NEWLINE][TAB]Mente- Perpentach[NEWLINE][TAB]Naturaleza- Herve[NEWLINE][TAB]Sombra- Wode (elfo)[NEWLINE][TAB]Espíritu- Laroth (quien crearía su propio imperio en el inframundo)[NEWLINE][TAB]Sol- Támesis[NEWLINE][TAB]Agua- Trenton Majosi[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kylorin con el tiempo se arrepiente de lo que le hizo al imperio de los hombres y reza pidiendo ayuda. Nantosuelta respondío a las plegarias y le enseñó cómo ser un mago aún más poderoso. Kylorin usa ese poder para liderar una rebelión en su propio imperio. Se aseguró de someter o matar a aquellos hechiceros que rechazaran arrepentirse, aunque algunos escaparon de su purga.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perpentach era un maestro de la magia mental, y un estudiante favorecido de Kylorin.  Kylorin no deseó matarlo, aprisionándolo en su lugar en una mazmorra bajo el Palus (La Torre de los Ojos), vigilada por golems sin cerebro.  Pero Perpentach era más talentoso de lo que Kylorin sospechaba, y fue capaz de enviar su consciencia sin ser descubierto lejos y más lejos de su prisión.  Buscando, creando ilusiones y controlando mentes a kilómetros de la mazmorra en un proceso que le tensó hasta el punto de fracturar su propia mente.  Pero trajo cientos de hombres a su prisión, les hizo luchar hasta vencer a los golems, soltarle y declarle como su señor.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La guerra dividió al imperio entre Kylorin, liderando a fuerzas buenas y religiosas, y las creaciones y la magia impura de los hechiceros. Al final 10 naciones humanas se habían formado; los Elohim, conservadores de memorias y guardianes de los lugares sagrados del mundo; los Bannor, administradores del fuego sagrado y los mayores enemigos de los hechiceros; los Kuriotates; que habitaron los bordes del imperio y se decía que estaban protegidos por un gran poder; los Malakim, nómadas del desierto y hombres de fe; los Lanun, mercantes y marineros; los Hippus; señores de los caballos y mercenarios; los Grigori, seguidores de Cassiel; los Balseraphs, dirigidos por el hechicero Perpentach; los Illians, que habitaron en la tundra y las tierras asoladas; y los Calabim, quienes serían gobernados por Alexis y Flauros.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La Creación se asentó en su nueva forma. Aún habían males muy poderosos en el mundo. Hechiceros que aún se escondían en la tierra y monstruos que vagaban por la espesura ahora que sus amos estaban muertos. Había mucho trabajo para los aventureros que deseaban recuperar artefactos perdidos o investigar áreas ocultas. Y hubo guerras.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fue en esta era fue en la que el aifon Trenton Majosi se marcó el objetivo de salvar a su pueblo. Volvió con la única salvación posible, un ritual que permitiría a Dalain entrar en la creación y salvar a sus hijos. Como si hubieran vuelto a la Guerra de los Dioses, Trenton no completo el ritual con éxito y los Aifons y Trenton fueron destruidos. La pérdida de sus hijos de la creación obligó a Danalin a retirarse, cayendo en un sueño del que aún no se ha despertado.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Agares, el primero en caer, le susurró a Bhall, el ángel del Fuego, y sucumbió por sus palabras. Este fue le fin de la edad de la magia. Bhall cayó de los cielos y esa noche llovió fuego del cielo. Los hombres leales a ella fueron transformados en horripilantes razas de orcos, convirtiéndose en el Clan de las Ascuas. La capital del imperio Bannor, que guardaba el más grande de los templos, cayó en el infierno con ella.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Ese ritual descubierto por Trenton Majosi se las arregló para acabar en manos de los Illians.  No tenían miedo de una Guerra de Dioses, pues Bhall fue la responsable de oponerse a la deidad patrona de los Illians, Mulcarn. Con la caída de Bhall, su señor no tenía oposición, y esto desposeyó a la gente que vió una oportunidad de tener algo más que los escombros dejados para ellos por el resto de la humanidad.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]El mundo ardía y aunque muchos visionarios y profetas supieron inmediatamente que el ritual había empezado, pocos imperios fueron capaces de enviar ejércitos para detener el ritual que estaba siendo llevado a cabo. Sólo una única tribu Khazad respondió, mientras que los Luchuirp reunieron un ejército. Ellos eran constructores de golems así que los suministros de comida no serían un problema para su ejército, no como para otras naciones. Los Luchuirp asaltaron la capital Illian con toda la fuerza de sus maquinas de guerra, pero ya era demasiado tarde. Tan pronto como entraron a través de los muros de la ciudad, Mulcarn entró en la creación y con un susurro el ejército Luchuirp fue barrido por completo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Un invierno permanente se asentó por toda la creación.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]La Edad de Hielo[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los dioses consideraron esta rotura de la concisión. No dispuestos a reiniciar la Guerra de los Dioses, pero no podían permitir que Mulcarn se moviera por la creación sin desafío. Estuvieron de acuerdo en dejar que un dios fuera a la creación para luchar contra Mulcarn. Ese dios fue Sucellus, el dios de la naturaleza.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sucellus entró en la creación y combatió a Mulcarn. Al mismo tiempo los Ljosalfar se tornaron. Habían accedido a compartir el poder entre dos reinas, una para gobernar durante el verano y otra durante el invierno. La reina del invierno aseguró su dominio durante años, pues el invierno no daba señales de que fuera a terminar y rechazó dejar el trono. Este pretexto provocó una guerra civil y los de la nueva rama leal a la reina del invierno se llamaron a sí mismos los Svartalfar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Sucellus perdió, y fue asesinado por Mulcarn. La creación se congeló incluso más, y los elfos se vieron forzados a detener su guerra, pues ya no podían movilizar más ejércitos o viajar. Se las arreglaron para encontrar lugares ocultos en el mundo en los que permanecer, y esperaron a que el invierno terminara para seguir con su guerra.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los imperios de los hombres fueron aplastados por las ventiscas y el poder de Mulcarn. Sobrevivieron algunas tribus dispersas, pero incluso éstas eran poco más que animales al borde de la superviviencia. Todos los avances de la Edad de la Magia se perdieron.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Los mismos Illians vivieron mejor que la mayoría, pero su dios tenía poca compasión e incluso ellos se vieron forzados a vivir con lo básico para soportar la inalterable voluntad de Mulcarn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Algunas tribus se unieron para formar una nueva civilización, los Doviello. Estos hombres abrazaron su naturaleza animal y se convirtieron en algo más parecido a una manada de lobos que en hombres. Fueron de utilidad para Mulcarn, cazando y asesinando a otras tribus, y sin interferir en las acciones de los Illians. Y tenían poco interés en los avances y convertirse en lo que Mulcarn aborrecía, así que se les permitió permanecer.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]En una esquina de Erebus se mantenía un respiro lejos del invierno. El fiero pozo que era el templo dedicado a Bhall mantenía una pequeña porción de su esencia, y siguió ardiendo, dando cobijo a los orcos, quienes prosperaron en su esquina del mundo. Mientras tanto sus hermanos, los Bannor, atrapados en el Infierno, se enfrentaban a una lucha constante por la supervivencia. Junil, admirando su determinación, envió a su Arcángel Sabathiel para liderarlos. Más tarde emergieron en la Edad de Hielo, en el corazón del territorio orco, incitando una rivalidad que persistió durante generaciones.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La creación habría permanecido así para siempre si Kylorin no hubera vuelto. Unió a las tribus dispersas de los hombres bajo una misma bandera, llamándolos los Amurites. Reforjó la piezas rotas de la Matadioses y la utilizó para combatir a Mulcarn, matándolo y dando fin a la Edad de Hielo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Edad del Renacimiento[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Después de la muerte del dios del invierno, Sucellus renació, ahora como dios de la vida. Por primera vez un dios pasó entre el inframundo y la creación y las puertas quedaron abiertas entre estas realidades. Mas un grupo de elfos vivos, empujados hace tiempo a la Mazmorra de Laroth, escaparon. Se trajeron con ellos algunas piedras robadas de los estudios de Laroth en el inframundo. Una de ellas sería utilizada por Sandalphon para enseñar a los hombres a convertirse en sombras y dar lugar a los Sidar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Como los Doviello de la anterior edad, hombres de varias tribus empezaron a congregarse bajo una bandera oscura. Esta vez respondiendo a una promesa de poder arcano. Liderados por Tebryn Asbandi y Os-Gabella se hacen llamar los Sheaim, poderosos invocadores que comparten sus secretos abiertamente.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Por último, Hastur, arcángel de Mammon, invade el descanso acuoso de Danalin. Encontrandose el dios aún durmiendo, Hastur empieza a susurrarle, causándole pesadillas que son reflejadas en la creación.</Spanish>

		<English>Chapter 1: Fall of Mammon Cycle[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mammon sat in the shadow of a great mountain. He liked creation, the smells of fresh earth and growing things, the mix of warm sunlight and cool breezes. But a world is more than the material and his mind was exploring one of his own creations, mathematics.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The One had removed the power of creation from them, but the gods were still powerful. Though the laws of Erebus were set, they could easily bend them. But in time they would return to their natural state. Mammon wished he could remake some of the laws he had applied, and even now played with changing them and watched the impact of his changes on the clouds that drifted overhead. The way the clouds split, funneled, dispersed and moved were minutely changed by the slightest of his adjustments.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the god of foresight Mammon watched the world play out due to his tiny changes. The clouds shadow that uncovered a mother mouse a second sooner. The hawk that spotted the now uncovered mouse. The mouse that would die in the hawks claws. The mouse babies that would starve without their mother. The seeds that would not be eaten by the mice. The plants that would now grow from those seeds.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The clouds rolled towards the west, they were bone white and hung low in the sky. All except a single cloud that traveled east, seemingly ignoring all natural laws. Mammon considered the futures changed by the defiant cloud. Weather patterns changed, storms that would and wouldn't occur now. The changed world that existed because of that cloud.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Would you be so quick to change everything if you knew the implications of your actions?" Mammon asked the sky.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Tali, god of the air, smiled down at the serious god, "I suspect that everything turns out the same no matter what we do."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mammon frowned, "That is not true."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]But secretly Mammon wondered if Tali was right.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A distant ceremony beckoned to both the gods. All the gods gathered around a shallow pool and with a thought Mammon and Tali joined them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Within the pool a woman floated, perfect of form with smooth, pale skin and long, black hair. She was to be Gabella, formed by Aeron into the first woman and she was receiving a blessing from each of the gods.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Bhall, goddess of fire, floated in the pool with Gabella and fire danced across the pools surface and shimmered in its depths. Bhall held the sleeping Gabella and whispered into her ear, "I give you the capacity for passion and love, that you can give these gifts to others and can receive them to yourself."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At that she kissed Gabella gently on the forehead. Gabella continued to float as Bhall let go and stepped out of the pool. Ceridwen came next, floating above the pool she allowed the long tendrils of her gown to reach down and lift Gabella gently to her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Oghma was watching Mammon closely. The two were as close as their precepts, Oghma was knowledge of everything that was and Mammon was the god of knowledge of everything that will be. The thin line of the present separated their dominions and because of that the gods had a close affinity for each other.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Deciding that something had changed Oghma whispered to Mammon, "You seem bothered."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nemed spoke to all the gathered gods before Mammon could respond.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I mean to give her eternal life. That mankind can share our immortality and live without death."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The gods considered, all life in creation was meant to be temporary. They were not making gods, but a world with seasons and cycles. Arawn was the first to respond.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"They have not known heaven, but they will yearn for it. Are you sure that our creation is so perfect that it should be unending?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At that the gods all began speaking at once. Only Agares, who watched without comment, and Mammon stayed out of the conversation. Mammon already knew the outcome. It was the same as any major decision they had to make, they would ask him. It was Nemed who asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Mammon, what do you foresee for Gabella and her children? Should she live eternal, or live only for a time within creation?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For the first time Mammon was afraid to answer. Something was wrong, and for one who always knew the future being blind to it terrified him. Mammon could see the creation of Gabella, could see her rebellion and refusal to submit to the plan of the gods. Beyond that he saw the rebellion of Agares, and his attempt to challenge the One. He saw the One standing in creation, judging the world. But he couldn't see anything beyond that moment. If there was any future beyond that he was blind to it. Mammon suspected that the One unmade them and creation. He suspected that he was seeing his own death.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In regards to Gabella's immortality, for the time that Mammon could see there was no difference. With or without eternal life Gabella would refuse to become the mother of humanity. With either option she would live until Mammon's vision failed him. She would live as long as Mammon would.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rather than admit that his vision was gone, rather than tell the gods that Agares would betray them, that they would all die, Mammon pretended to know and for the first time gave advice without knowing if it was correct.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Allow them to be immortal, they should not fear death." Mammon was beginning to know that fear to well himself.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Arawn seemed bothered by the response but said nothing. Nemed entered the pool, embraced Gabella and whispered into her ear. From that moment she was as immortal as a single god could make her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mammon was next. He walked across the surface of the pool and sat down at Gabella's side.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Wake child." He said softly.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gabella sat up and her eyes fluttered open. She was still in the daze of birth and likely wouldn't see or remember him, but he wanted to see her eyes. Aeron had fashioned her body perfectly, she was beautiful, strong and unique in feature.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I give you..." Mammon leaned close, so that no one could overhear, "I give you nothing, so that you might always wonder and won't know the pleasures and the pains of the future."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gabella lay back down in the pool and returned to her sleep. Agares was the last to give his blessing and he stepped into the pool. At his touch the water changed to a blend of black and gold, a beautiful labyrinth or bright gold veins appearing and disappearing into emptiness. The gold strands caressed Gabella's body and again her eyes fluttered open to meet Agares's gaze.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I give you hope, a belief in what can be, that you will not know despair."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Oghma was watching Mammon closely, he would be the only one who knew that Mammon didn't give a gift to Gabella. Similarly Mammon watched Agares, searching unsuccessfully for some hint of his future betrayal.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=SPELL_ESCAPE]Chapter 2: Fall of Mammon Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=IMPROVEMENT_SEVEN_PINES]Chapter 3: Fall of Mammon Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=BUILDING_ALTAR_OF_THE_LUONNOTAR]Chapter 4: Fall of Mammon Cycle[\LINK]</English>

		<English>[LINK=IMPROVEMENT_POOL_OF_TEARS]Chapter 1: Fall of Mammon Cycle[\LINK][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chapter 2: Fall of Mammon Cycle[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nemed was reborn a man. He gave the precept of life to Arawn and now he marveled at the slightest sensations of creation. The way the grass tickled his feet, the goose bumps on his back from the cool air, and the weight of his own body.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gabella stood watching a distant storm. The grasslands swayed around her and the scattered copses of trees turned their leaves skyward in expectation of the coming rain. Though she was just a few hours old Oghma had given her not only the capacity to learn but an understanding of creation that made her the equal of any scholar in later ages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As Nemed approached she raised one hand to stop him then she turned to consider him. He had expected to see an expression of a swan to its mate, or a baby bear to its mother. But instead he saw the calm, dangerous look of a predator, of a lioness surveying her land.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I am Nemed, I am to be your husband. We will populate this world with our children."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This was the first pickup line in creation, and it was a colossal failure. Gabella turned to reveal a sharpened stick she held in her left hand, in a smooth motion she leapt at him, knocking Nemed to the ground and placing the spears tip against his penis.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gabella smiled at his look of surprise, "I suspect this may happen exactly opposite of how you intended."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nemed tried to throw her off but she was stronger, and faster, than the once god. In one motion she stabbed him, tearing through his scrotum and ripping his penis off in one meaty chunk. Gabella admired it briefly before flipping it off into the grass. Nemed screamed in pain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The gods appeared around the two. Sirona was at Nemed's side, and even though he quickly healed from the wound the memory of pain and fear left him shaken. Gabella was held fast in Dagda's power, frozen under the consideration of the gods.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Have we failed, should we remove Gabella from creation?" Dagda asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]No one answered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nantosuelta approached Gabella, she brushed Gabella's long black hair back away from her face. "Child, couldn't you see the results of your actions? Why did you fear the advances of Nemed so? Don't you long for the generations before you?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It was Lugus who answered, "She is without foresight. Her fear consumes her, making her little more than a beast despite our gifts.

His right hand shone with the pure white light of birth, his left with the gray power of ending. He raised his left hand over Gabella but before he lowered it Ceridwen appeared behind the trapped Gabella. The flowing tendrils of Ceridwen's gown surrounded Gabella, completely blocking her from the sight of the other gods.

The way the grass tickled his feet, the goose bumps on his back from the cool air, and the weight of his own body.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Gabella stood watching a distant storm. The grasslands swayed around her and the scattered copses of trees turned their leaves skyward in expectation of the coming rain. Though she was just a few hours old Oghma had given her not only the capacity to learn but an understanding of creation that made her the equal of any scholar in later ages.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As Nemed approached she raised one hand to stop him then she turned to consider him. He had expected to see an expression of a swan to its mate, or a baby bear to its mother. But instead he saw the calm, dangerous look of a predator, of a lioness surveying her land.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I am Nemed, I am to be your husband. We will populate this world with our children."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This was the first pickup line in creation, and it was a colossal failure.

In one motion she stabbed him, tearing through his scrotum and ripping his penis off in one meaty chunk. Gabella admired it briefly before flipping it off into the grass. Nemed screamed in pain.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The gods appeared around the two. Sirona was at Nemed's side, and even though he quickly healed from the wound the memory of pain and fear left him shaken. Gabella was held fast in Dagda's power, frozen under the consideration of the gods.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Have we failed, should we remove Gabella from creation?" Dagda asked.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]No one answered.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Nantosuelta approached Gabella, she brushed Gabella's long black hair back away from her face. "Child, couldn't you see the results of your actions? Why did you fear the advances of Nemed so?

This time the gifts were to be less than those given to Gabella, so she wouldn't be pulled in different directions by each of their aspects. And she would be mortal in form so that whatever she chose, she would not have a permanent impact on creation. Her soul was to remain immortal, and Arawn agreed to tend to her soul, and those of the mortal generations that would follow her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]They named her Anesidora and she was as gentle as Gabella was fierce. Nemed built a farm on the edge of a great river for them to share. It was bordered by seven great pine trees and the gods frequently visited the farm. It was a favorite place for squirrels to play and they could often be seen chasing each other along the buildings and trees, or chattering noisily at anyone who passed, god or man.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]One day Agares and Mammon stood by the river's edge and the squirrels chattered at them. One even came to Agares's foot, looking up at the powerful god and squeaking as if laying out all the worlds problems for him. Agares simply smiled at the tiny creature and offered him a small nut, which the squirrel happily accepted before hopping away.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"The One will return to creation soon." Mammon commented.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Agares nodded.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"When he does, you will rebel against him."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Agares stayed silent to this. The two gods sat and watched the squirrels battle, the nut Agares had given one had caused them to start quarreling with each other over it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Finally Agares asked, "How does it end?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I don't know" Mammon answered, "I see you rebel, I see him considering creation and then nothing. I can't see a future for anyone beyond that moment. I believe he kills us all and unmakes creation."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Agares nodded, then asked "What do you think we should have done with Gabella?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"You mean, what should the One do with you?"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Agares simply responded, "Yes."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I don't know.

It was a few days since her birth but she was already the greatest predator in creation and hunted without fear. It was spring and the sun, filtered through the leaves, created a net of light on the forest floor. There was no night in this world, it was caught in permanent day and made any time equally good for hunting.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then two gods surrounded her. They held a thousand forms, and the world reacted to their thoughts. In one vision Junil seemed to swing a brilliant white sword at her only to have it blocked by the shield of Camulos. In another a tree broke and collapsed on her, but a wolf leapt and knocked her out of the way. In another the gods simply stood on each side of her, considering their possible actions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Os-Gabella suspected this last vision was the true one, but the world seemed to ripple out from the gods as if it was only smoke someone had passed their hand through. Not only did the hand change the direction of the smoke, but the wind that followed it. Even the most minor thoughts of the gods changed the world, and these weren't minor thoughts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Junil wanted her dead and Camulos stood protectively over her, and the power of his dominion held Junil at bay.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Os-Gabella fled into the trees, running from shadow to shadow back to the place of safety that Ceridwen had provided her, the Bair of Lacuna. She briefly came out of the shadows to cross a small glade and almost ran into a figure standing in the shadows on the other side. He was massive and well muscled, more so than any other god and he radiated an aura of virility and masculinity. It was Aeron.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Calm, child," he said, "I do not wish you harm."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Os-Gabella adjusted quickly, cutting around the opposite side of a massive oak and sprinting on. But she wasn't fast enough; Aeron was instantly on the other side of the tree waiting for her. He reached for her, grabbing her left wrist.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Os-Gabella attacked, hitting Aeron in the nose with an open palm. Her blow was like a breeze against a mountain and Aeron only smiled.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I have not given up my divinity, though you are perfectly fashioned, I am a god."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Os-Gabella struggled but Aeron wrapped a thick arm around her waist and pulled her close to him. She could feel the heat of his body against her and was helpless in his grip.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"What do you want of me?" she screamed.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"I mean to enjoy my creation, and that you would know the affections of a god. That you would have children devoted to me who are strong, cunning and immortal."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In that moment the One entered creation. For a brief second Os-Gabella felt like she was every part of creation. She was the sunlight filtering through the leaves, the patchwork of grass it fell upon, the river that flowed past Nemed's farm, the clouds in the sky. She was the god that was about to rape her, and the woman about to be raped. She was everything in creation at once. And creation was only her alone.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In that moment she knew the mind of every god, and she felt their fear, mistrust and jealousy. She knew their strength and weaknesses. And she loved and hated each of them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The One stood on a white stone slab looking out across creation. The 21 gods appeared around him, each afraid and ashamed for different reasons.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Mammon was consumed with his own dwindling time. He had only a precious few moments of life left and he watched them slip uselessly through his fingers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Agares rushed the One, wings unfurled he leapt into the air before him, sword raised high. The One simply caught the charging angel in one hand and threw him down. The force of the blow shattered the Angel and left him lying broken in the dirt.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The One raised one hand toward Mammon. The arm rose like an hourglass with only a few remaining grains of sand. When it was fully raised Mammon's vision would end, he would be no more.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Then Mammon heard Agares's voice, "Flee, rebel, forget."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]And in that moment he did. He betrayed his dominion, turned against the One and felt a new power within him. A great desire that could never be filled. Blind to the future he became ruled by the need to control and possess. And he fled from the One.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Aeron, Mulcarn, Esus, Ceridwen and Camulos fled as well. But destruction did not follow them. The One remained briefly in creation, meeting with the gods that remained loyal to him. Then he returned to the true heaven and sundered that path between heaven and creation. </English>

		<English>The vault is dominated by a great mountain. The mountain is larger than any on Erebus, it is steep, rigid and punishing. The pinnacle is called the throne of hell (not an actual throne) and is the main gateway between the hells and Erebus (in the Fane of Lessers) and the portal through which souls are drawn into hell.[NEWLINE]The mountain gets colder the higher you climb, and its base and rocky spires are hunted by the remaining servants of Mulcarn, frost giants, frostlings, aquilan and the nive.[NEWLINE]Below a vast waste slopes away from the mountain. The rough tundra turns into a swamp. Each step through the swamp is a battle and the languid pools pull at anyone trying to get through them. Beneath the surface the largest source of petitioners in hell are trapped, this is the purgatory for the non-committal. They lay here for ages, consuming their own excrement and feeling nothing but slight pain and lethargy. In time they will overcome their passive nature and continue down into hell, but for now they are victims of their own inaction. Tar demons are pulled form these pools, gelatinous blobs with little humanity remaining.[NEWLINE]There are creatures in the swamp, mites and bugs that leaving horrid burning blisters where they bite. They are not deadly, most that travel here are immortal, but the creatures steal the strength of those that pass through the swamp, inviting petitioners to lay beneath the black waters and succumb to mindless eternity that this realm offers.</English>

		<English>There is one great city in hell and it dominates this entire world of Mammon. The wastes of Mulcarn's realm lead down into it and eventually the souls will be drawn to the city. As they get closer to the city they are transformed from ethereal spirits to a physical manifestation similar to their body in life.[NEWLINE]As each petitioner enters the city he is given a coin, and the only way to progress through the city is to give seven coins to the Balors that guard the gateway at the cities heart. As such the entire plane is a trial to gather the seven coins needed to escape (little do they know that only worse lays beyond). Balors guard the city and maintain some illusion of order. This keeps wars from breaking out and makes for some safe areas where you can't simply attack people to take their coins.[NEWLINE]The point of this realm isn't to teach the petitioners how to effectively get the coins, but to have them spend years, decades and centuries wanting them. Getting them to the point where they are completely subject to their greed and unbound by any morale constraints in getting them. They will lie, they will steal, but mostly they will become ruled by their desire in a city full of lies, false hope, and degradation.[NEWLINE]Some few never leave this stage of hell and intentionally become permanent citizens of this city. They occasionally rise into powerful positions, slave traders, dream merchants, cult leaders, etc. Mammon may take those that seem stuck and wipe their memories, forcing them to restart their entry into the city, but sometimes he leaves them be. Mammon is quite proud of his city, and one of the few (along with Esus) who views it as something more than just a part of a great machine.[NEWLINE]Oddly the city features a long street full of various temples. There are hundreds of gods represented, and temples are reguarly switched from one religion to another. Most of the "religions" are unique to this city. Some worship various demons that may or may not be in the city, some worship petitioners pretending to be gods. All of the gods of Erebus are represented except one, though most in blatant parody of the real religion. There is a temple to Lugus, for example, that claims that Lugus is dead and they worship hideously disfigured statues of their fallen god.[NEWLINE]The only god without a temple is Mammon. Mammon believes that the entire city is his temple.</English>

		<English>Petitioners who pass through Mammon's trial are dropped into the eternal war of Camulos. There is no order here, there is little logic or reason. Only pain, hatred and battle. The world is as chaotic as those that fill it and volcanoes blast the sky while earthquakes raze and create mountains.[NEWLINE]The point of this hell is to desensitize the petitioner to any form of pain. To go beyond any moral qualms at hurting or killing anyone. To delight in inflicting pain and build a need to torment others. To enjoy feeling pain themselves.[NEWLINE]A petitioner that is born here begins small and weak. Their exact form and abilities vary widely based on the personality of the soul. There is little pattern to them. They are the subject of pain for a long time before they ever have any chance to inflict it. They start as little more than savage beasts, their memories are lost when leaving Mammon's world and they are reduced only to their base nature. In time that nature will grow, but the memories of life will be faint or gone altogether from this point on. In time they become stronger until eventually their conquests will be legendary. If Mammon's hell is the corruption of the mind, this hell is the corruption of the spirit.[NEWLINE]Land is held by the powerful warlords of the plane, who travel in bands that are constantly betrayed by their members. Once a petitioner has grown strong enough they will simply be swallowed by the earth and surrounding warlords will be quick to step in and fill the void of the missing warlord.[NEWLINE]Occasionally powerful demons will come to this vault on hunting expeditions. They hunt the greatest or least of the spirits here and take them as servants (to fight in their own arenas as they aren't worth much else) or merely for the pleasure of killing them. There are occasional wastelands here, the shallows, where some spirits hide to escape the constant battle. Whatever peace they find doesn't last long, and the hell hounds and demon hunters make regular trips into the shallows to gather new slaves. Sometimes demons pull petitioners directly out of this vault to serve them in Erebus. These are enraged, wild demons. Strong, but without reason.[NEWLINE]The pits and tunnels beneath this vault are filled with vast prisons were the victims of war are kept. Here they suffer the worst physical torments and are forever unable to die. If there is any art in this violent hell it is in the perfection of torture. Trapped within dark holes, blood pouring through the ground like water and with the walls trembling with earthquakes and explosions you find the least fortunate of hells denizens.</English>

		<English>This is the conclusion. Agares takes little interest in the powerful figures that make their home in the mutable surface of his world. From the runs of Nyx the demon princes raise dark palaces and lay claim to their own small fiefdoms. There is little beyond this, the demons are drawn to it because of their affinity to Agares but few remain here long. Instead they begin their plots on Erebus or join the ranks of a god that appeals to them. In time their fiefdoms vanish and their palaces fade back to dust.[NEWLINE]Bhall lays burning in this realm and her corrupted angels with her. It is at the edge of her influence that the most demonic activity happens. As was never true before her fall the demonic denizens of this realm have begun to act together, impassioned by her presence they now delight in their schemes and have taken a much greater interest in creation. Cabal's have formed and even Hyborem seeks to challenge Erebus itself.</English>

The laws of nature are not fixed within these worlds, that which is set in the laws of creation is mutable here. By drawing from these places, pulling them into creation these laws can be bent. Fire can be made to move and leap, the dominions that were once subordinate only to the gods can be commanded by men.[NEWLINE]Esus may be the god of deception, but Cerdiwen is the queen of secrets.

		<English>Occasionally a petitioner refuses the processing of hell and attempts to escape. A handful of fallen angels have risen, or petitioners have triumphed over hell by manifesting the virtues that each vault attempts to remove from them and going through it backward until they climb the mountain of Mulcarn's realm and pass by the throne of hell itself back into Erebus. But this is an incredibly rare event.[NEWLINE]Most commonly those wishing to escape hell find their way into the illusionary world of Esus. This world appears as Erebus in every way. It is even populated by simulacrum's of the people the petitioner knew in life. They can return to their life here, they can believe that they have escaped from hell. But such joy will be short lived.[NEWLINE]The function of this hell is to remove any motivation that is keeping a petitioner from his processing. Those that escape hell for love will find their love again, but it will sour and fade. Those that escape to follow their duty will find their tasks to be eventually flawed and meaningless. Those that are searching for a new faith will find their worship empty and hollow.[NEWLINE]Everything in Esus's realm is a lie, and it is the most cunning trap of hell. </English>
