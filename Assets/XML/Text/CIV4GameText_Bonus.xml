		<English>In the colder parts of Erebus, cattle herding is prohibitively challenging, as the biting cold leaves little for them to forage. Instead, the people eking out an existence in those places elect to hunt the hardy, willful Bison to sustain themselves. But while any typical settlement can exploit the bounty of a Bison in a crafty fashion, the Doviello go one step further: some of them tame these beasts and use them as fearsome mounts. Even the knights of the Hippus are wary of charging at a pack of Bison Riders.</English>
		<French>Les Bisons naissent sans leur bosse et leurs cornes reconnaissables, et vivent environ 20 ans. Ils atteignent l'âge adulte vers deux ou trois ans, même si les mâles continuent de grandir jusqu'à leur 7 ans. Les mâles expriment une forte tendance à la bagarre à la domination durant la saison des amours. Le Bison mâle se bat souvent pour les femelles et ces luttes se terminent souvent pour des blessures ou la mort. Après l'accouplement, le troupeau se sépare en troupeaux plus réduits. Les femelles vêlent 9 mois plus tard, et s'occupent et nourissent leurs petits pour un an. Les Bisons mâles peuvent atteindre 3,5 m de long et 2 m au garrot, et peuvent peser jusqu'à 1100 kg.</French>

		<Italian>I bisonti nascono senza la loro caratteristice gobbe e corni e possono vivere per circa 20 anni. Diventano adulti intorno ai 2-3 anni, nonostante ciò i maschi continuano a crescere sino al loro settimo anno. I bisonti maschi adulti diventano particolarmente competitivi per il dominio durante la stagione degli accoppiamenti. Spesso questi scontri per le femmini si concludono con ferite o addirittura la morte. Dopo che si accoppiano la mandira principale si divide in mandrie più piccole. I vitelli nascono 9 mesi dopo l'accoppiamento e le madri si prendono cura del piccolo per un anno intero. I bisonti maschi possono arrivare ad essere lunghi 3.5m e alti, alla spalla, 2m  e pesare sino ai 998 kg.</Italian>

Along the Lanun, it is often a custom for one to make a deep dive in the seas, and collect as many as possible before having to go to the surface for air - the one with the biggest number gets free drinks from his buddies for the day. And a few species of clam are known for their lustrous pearls, to the point it's one of the most lucrative trades among many a Lanun captain.

		<English>In the Age of Rebirth, various nations had to relearn how to smelt and work metal. In the beginning, they started with Copper; its ease of use in those grueling early days meant troops could be fielded with weapons much easier than having to dig into dangerous ruins for remains from the Age of Magic. But once Iron became easier to forge, Copper immediately fell to the wayside. The Khazad, in particular, boast the ability to make Dagian Bronze, a metal able to conduct light throughout its surface. Its long ribbons go from above ground, collecting light to illuminate their vast underground cities.

		<English>As one Grigori adventurer once joked, the Lanun have two staples: fish and shrimp. Even to non-Lanun nations, fish are the staple seafood for any coastal city on Erebus, coming in many variants, each unique in its own way. But Lanun have a special relationship: no other nation can boast to have as many marine dishes as them. And many captains are adept enough that they can go for weeks without touching shore by simply subsisting on the bounty of the sea around them. Mordmorgan, in particular, considers it a point of pride to only go to shore for water, rum, and enough fruits to keep the threat of scurvy at bay.

Fur can come in many shapes: mink, beaver, rabbit. And once treated via tanning, they provide comfort against even the harshest conditions. The Doviello, in particular, have a savage custom: being given thick clothes by another is a mark of weakness. To gain respect, one must go into the wilderness and fight a predatory animal to the death, then use its hide to sew her own clothes.

		<English>The bread and butter of all masons on Erebus, stone has been used to construct any building imaginable. From the most humble of homesteads, to the most elaborate of aqueduct systems, stone provides a level of integrity wood could never do. Temples of Kilmorph favor stone over more elaborate building materials, its use a deliberate choice to signify a grounded, down to earth mentality. But its simplicity belies a hidden versatility: rocks polished to a sheen and enchanted by a savvy Luchuirp craftsman are the basis for the dreaded Nullstone Golem, which deflects magic with contemptuous ease.

		<English>Most common in the jungles of Erebus, Sugar is a crucial ingredient for all kinds of pastries. The Elohim in particular make great efforts to secure shipments from their Mazatl allies in service of preserving Patrian culinary traditions, in addition to maintaining their unique cuisines. The orcs of the Clan of Embers, however, have a much cruder use of it: fermentation and distillation. Orcish alcohol is notorious for its extreme strength, and many are so brazen as to use it as fuel for incendiary attacks.
	
	And in case anyone is stupid enough to try it: Valledia voided her stomach's contents after she did so. Stick to Khazad brewery. It's much less offensive to your body, and they have centuries of tradition backing their craftsmanship. Deruptus Ale is some of the finest in Creation!</English>

And with the Infernals entering creation, that rumor proved itself horrifyingly true: popping up wherever hell's influence seeps into the earth, and anyone slain by blades coated with it finding themselves at the mercy of the great machine of hell. The faithful of the Ashen Veil often coat their blades with its juices, their kills in service of whichever demon lord they serve.

		<English>Often known as Blasting Powder, Gunpowder is a new innovation of the Age of Rebirth, and some say it signals the coming of a new age without magic. It is commonly made with sulfur, but gunpowder made with Belrite (a rock that blows up when it comes into contact with fire) is even more highly sought after. The Mechanos, in particular, use their knowledge taken from the Khazad to great effect: the quality of their blasting powder is what gives their dreaded Howitzers their deadly efficiency, to the point even the Infernals are wary of the whistle of falling shells.

		<English>"Some of you may wonder why our restrictions on Chaos Magic are so stringent. Consider Loukas: as he grew in aptitude, the normally jovial attitude he exhibited changed into something malign. Erratic outbursts of violence. Willingness to harm others for the most inconsequential of reasons. Abusing his fortune to come out on top at the expense of everyone around him. By the time we realized we had a problem on our hands, it was too late: we saw him beating his own forcibly mutated protege into a pulp, with unhinged glee all over his face."
	-Principal Patrocle, on the trial and execution of Archmage Loukas
	
The power of chaos and randomness. Practitioners have little to no control over the outcome of their spells. They merely channel their power toward their target.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Practitioners are usually immune to the effect of their own spells and the influence of this dominion. Instead their influence usually impacts those around them, often unintentionally. Accidents are more common, and others are more apt to take rash actions. Many practitioners are gamblers, not because this dominion helps them, instead it negatively impacts those gambling against them.

The source of this power comes from the world itself. It is strengthened in contact with massive blocks of stone, weakened when standing on dirt or cut blocks and practitioners lose all affinity for this dominion if they aren't in contact with the earth at all. Being in a tree, on a horse, or simply held up in the air by someone else will negate their ability. But when in contact the practitioner can call on all aspects of the world to either imbue themselves with these aspects or transform the earth and stone around them.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Because their power comes from contact with the earth many practitioners of this dominion choose not to wear shoes. Their magic will work through the short distance, but it is weakened. Because of their affinity and because their feet are in direct contact with the earth they can often sense anyone walking nearby. Masters of this dominion stop needing to breathe and can be mistaken for being dead, which isn't helped by the fact that they sometimes bury themselves when meditating.

		<Italian>Si può capire molto di un mago dal suo campo preferito. Prendiamo Korven come esempio. Adepto della Terra. Non molto sveglio, ma onesto. È un grande lavoratore e anche un po testardo. Può non lanciare bene la magia la prima volta, ma lui riproverà fino a quando non riuscirà a farlo come un passatempo. Ci impiega il doppio del tempo a imparare una nuova magia, ma quando la impara la fa doppiamente meglio. -Adepto Morin</Italian>

This dominion never works overtly. Instead the aspects of objects are enhanced by it. Without other dominions, only existing aspects can be heightened, a wall can be made stronger, a sword sharper. But with ties with fire a sword can be given a burning blade, or with darkness a charm can be made to hide the wearer. These spells take complex rituals and days, weeks, months or years to cast depending on their complexity.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Practitioners of this dominion are typically collectors of obscure and varied objects. They can sense the affinity an object has for a dominion and they are quick to gather ones with a strong affinity because it makes enchanting them in that dominion much easier. A practitioner skilled in this dominion and death is likely to have a morbid collection of items strong with death affinity nearby, murderer's knives, gravedigger's shovel, pieces of gravestones, hangman's noose, etc. They occasionally find affinity for an item that they don't expect (a key with a strong affinity for mind magic) and can spend a lot of time trying to research the history of the object to find out why.

[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Notable Practitioners include Mikel Dylantyr, apprentice to Kylorin.</Spanish>

		<English>"As all of you know, outside of my duties as principal, I am also the resident tutor in Force Magic. Most of you simply know that Force is the sphere that counters all other magic. Few of you know the why: Magic at its core is the imbalancing of the spheres to achieve the desired outcome. Force's anti-magical nature is because it reasserts that balance, ensuring nothing oversteps its boundary. Some of you know where I'm getting at. But for the rest of you, once you come out of this class, no one will exert their will on you without your consent ever again."
	-Principal Patrocle, class introduction
	
This is the power of the immutable. The power of authority and judgement. Magic is performed as "Decrees", the Decree of Eternal Vigilance compels someone to protect the target with their life. The Decree of Silence keeps someone from ever speaking about a subject and the Decree of Sanctity keeps the target from entering a specific location. Decrees can apply to people or inanimate objects. Powerful practitioners can have decrees that impact the entire world. A "wall of force" isn't a physical construct, it is a decree that nothing can pass the area that is applied to the entire world.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Many practitioners of this dominion are mute. They tend to be open minded and thoughtful, but once they make a decision, they are slow to move off of it.

Many think picking Life is taking the coward's way, where you only heal ailments and stay away from trouble. But these people are wrong. Life isn't just about that. It's about steeling yourself and making sure you can tackle the hardest challenges. It's about giving yourself the power to fight for what you believe in, no matter the hardship. Oh, what about me, you ask? I live for my family. I'd do everything for them."
	-Archmage Mirthan, class introduction
	
Minor practitioners can influence fertility and help speed healing. More powerful can perform miraculous healing or extend life. Practitioners can also sense back through generations of a subject, sensing who assessors are, and bringing out their assets in their descendant.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Practitioners are often conceived without sex. Those conceived like this often have high affinity. Practitioners are often drawn to those that are suffering, though they are often sought by powerful men as a balm against disease and old age.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Notable Practitioners include Leucetios, apprentice to Kylorin and daughter of Nemed.</Spanish>

		<English>"Every human being has the potential to become something more within them. Allowing them to express their inner talents is the greatest gift you could bestow to them. Look at the people I took in my tutelage: the children who used to beg now support others like them. The aspiring athlete is now the aspiration for his peers. That young lady who wanted to inspire her beloved now inspires her home town to do more than they thought they could. Keeping such knowledge away only reinforces unnatural imbalances of power. Humanity will never reach greatness as long as this persists."

This dominion focuses on the nature of magic itself. It is most commonly used to detect and identify magic. Though at moderate levels it can be used to break and disrupt spells and at the highest levels it can be used to transform magic, or the way it works. A master in this dominion can create an area where magic doesn't work, move an enchantment from one object to another, or trap a magical creature in an object.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This dominion has to be accessed through symbols, runes and ritual. Practitioners spend long hours studying to understand these complex interactions much as a chemist studies chemistry. This makes for bookish, arcane sorts. Unusually there are varied types of this dominion that seem to have little connection to each other. One may understand magical interactions through precise mathematical drawings, another through colorful mandala, other through carvings on elaborate 3 dimensional objects. These all have the same result, but students of each have little to learn from each other. It appears that any way it is envisioned it is only an interpretation for the true nature of magic, and practitioners can only hope to learn by continuing to learn more about their particular interpretation. Learning another is like starting over.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Notable Practitioners include Auric Ulvin, Govannon and Gastrius, apprentice to Kylorin.</English>

The power of memory and thought. Practitioners can read minds and protect their thoughts from the same. The more powerful can manipulate the memories of their targets or dominate them entirely. There are a wide range of effects that can be caused by this dominion, from becoming "invisible" by causing on target to fail to notice you, to implanting thoughts (you should go out on patrol), or mistaking the senses (that stick is a snake). The effects typically require concentration to maintain the effect. This dominion is largely ineffective against those whose minds are significantly different than the practitioners (so a human would be unable to affect animals or angels).
Exposure to others minds often causes befuddlement or confusion in the practitioner. They are often unable to simply cause the change they want and will expose themselves to other thoughts or memories of their targets. Practitioners who use the power to frequently may begin to dream as if they were their target, or have odd memories from the lives of those they have influenced. Many go insane. Others suffer dementia where their memories become lost in sea of others.

		<English>It was the last day of my apprenticeship, the first day I could claim the title Adept. My master brought me to this hilltop and sat. By his silence, I knew he was awaiting the answer to an unasked question. This time, as usual, I didn't know what was expected of me. I looked around, searching. After a time, as he continued to gaze at me, I grew frustrated. I was about to speak, to ask for the riddle so I could begin to answer it, when suddenly I felt-nay, tasted the glorious stuff for the first time. The Ether. My eyes betrayed my ecstasy, and my master smirked knowingly. He arched his eyebrow. I answered, finally, with one word. "Power."</English>

		<German>Am letzten Tag meiner Ausbildung, gleichzeitig der erste Tag, an dem ich den Titel Adept tragen durfte, nahm mich mein Meister mit auf den Gipfel dieses Hügels. Er setzte sich nieder. Durch sein Schweigen wusste ich, dass er eine Antwort auf eine unausgesprochene Frage erwartete. Wie immer wusste ich nicht, was von mir erwartet wurde, also schaute ich mich suchend um. Nach einer Weile, während er mich fortwährend anstarrte, wurde ich ungeduldig. Ich öffnete meine Lippen, um nach der Aufgabe fragen, da spürte  nein kostete  ich es plötzlich zum ersten Mal. Den Äther. Mein Augen müssen meine Verzückung verraten haben, den mein Meister grinste vielsagend. Erwartungsvoll hob er seine Augenbrauen und ich antwortete mit einem einzigen Wort: "Macht".</German>

Dal suo silenzio sapevo che stava aspettando una risposta a una domanda non posta. Quella volta, come al solito, non sapevo cosa si apettasse da me. Io guardavo in giro, cercando. Dopo un pò, mentre continuava a fissarmi, diventavo sempre più frustrato. Stavo per parlare, per chiedere quale fosse l'indovinello cosi da poter rispondere, quando all'improvviso percepii per la prima volta la sensazione gloriosa dell'etere. I miei occhi tradirono la mia estasi, e il mio maestro sorrise compiaciuto. Lui arcuò le sopracciglia. Io risposi, finalmente, con una parola. "Potere."</Italian>

The real final exam is if you can steal a copy of the answers without Lyn noticing. And don't expect this to be easy - she's nearly as sadistic as Drahm when it comes to mean tricks. Take it from me, I learned to not trust a word she says or even believe things are how they are at face value. Hell, if you trust me, I could swipe the answers for you for a fee. Do you?"

This is the power of deception, hiding and illusion. Unlike other dominions that give the power to detect their power, that is not granted through shadow. A practitioner can create illusions of size and complexity depending on his affinity.

This is the power of revelation and spiritual truth. At modest levels it can destroy illusions and force the truth out of someone, and at the most powerful it can tear away everything false from a target, both physically and emotionally. It can strike those that refuse to see the truth blind, turn strong but insecure men into burnt reflections of their spiritual selves, and shock a rioting mob into seeing exactly what they have become.

They make the best warhorses on Erebus but they eat meat and are cruel to anyone except those strong enough to master them. They lure warriors away from their camps. The warriors chase after them, hoping to capture the dark steed, only to have the nightmare turn on them and consume them. Nightmares hate normal horses and normal horses are scared of nightmares.

		<English>Every now and then, the earth itself bursts open to spew lava and searing tephra at its surroundings. And ever since the fall of Bhall, this phenomenon only became more frequent and destructive. But to those able to weather such an event, they find themselves with a unique material: obsidian. Able to be sharpened to an extreme edge, it is the material of choice for various Mazatl tools and weapons, due to their proximity to Mount Kalshekk. And nations able to equip their workers with Obsidian tools find themselves outcompeting their peers in exploiting the land.
</English>
		<French>Obsidian is a naturally occurring volcanic glass formed as an extrusive igneous rock. It is produced when felsic lava extruded from a volcano cools without crystal growth. Obsidian is commonly found within the margins of rhyolitic lava flows known as obsidian flows, where the chemical composition (high silica content) induces a high viscosity of the lava. Because of the lack of crystal structure, obsidian blade edges can reach incredible thinness, leading to its use as projectile points and scalpel blades.</French>

Gli esseri umani stanno raccogliendo il sale da migliaia di anni; una pratica iniziata nella storia più remota, molto prima che si scrivesse la storia. [ PARAGRAPH:2]Una delle principali proprietà del sale è la capacità di conservare il cibo. Prima dello sviluppo di un affidabile refrigerazione, uno dei pochi modi conosciuti per conservare il cibo dal deperire era usare il sale, che ritardarda o impedisce l'invasione microbica (alcuni tipi di cibo possono essere conservati anche atrtaverso l'affumicatura). Oltre alle capacità di conservazione, il sale rende il sapore di alcuni cibi migliore. [ PARAGRAPH:2]Uno dei primi metodi scoperti per la raccolta del sale era far evaporare l'acqua di mare sotto il sole, un processo molto noioso e costoso, motivo del costo elevato di tale importante bene. Cio non cambiera sino alla metà del diciannovesimo secolo - quando la raccolta e l'estrazione mineraria del sale sono ampiamente svolte nell mondo che questo bene diventerà molto meno costoso, non valendo più "il suo peso in oro", come veniva comunemente descritto.</Italian>
