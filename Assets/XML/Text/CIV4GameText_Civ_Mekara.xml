		<English>The Mekara Order began as a cabal of Amurite mages, united by an common dream: Ascension.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Founded by the necromancer D'tesh, they worked for years in secrecy, experimenting on slaves smuggled in through the black market, as well as occasional undesirables snatched from the streets or prisons. Eventually, internal conflicts started causing tensions within the cabal, with D'tesh unwilling to share the power they sought with the rest, and keeping for himself what might have been the key to their dream: the Gem of Death. [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]As the tensions continued to build the Mekara Order eventually tore itself apart from within, with D'tesh leaving to continue his research on his own, reasoning that he had no further use for the Mekara Order with the Gem of Death in his possession, and leaving one of his rivals, Jamal Dahkar, in charge. [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Due to this internal conflict, the Mekara Order was exposed to the authorities, who subsequently had them arrested, put on trial and exiled. The remaining members travelled from country to country after that, gaining occasional followers, but more often than not earning the ire of the local peoples.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]After years of wandering, they settled in a region near the Calabim border, where they entered into an arrangements with the local governor. In return for sanctuary, they would teach her the ways of magic, and give her a position of prestige and power within the Mekara Order. Subsequently, the Mekara Order took over the day-to-day affairs of her province, breaking free from the Calabim nation and starting out on their own.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH] Though the people they rule are almost exclusively Calabim, the ones who make the decisions are nearly all Amurites, and all members of the Mekara Order, to whom the commoners are of little consequence. They provide rudimentary security and education, but the only times they take an interest beyond that, is when someone either shows themselves to be extremely competent, or defies them. In either case, they are removed from society, either to be inducted into the Mekara Order, or thrown into the slave pens, to be used as guinea pigs or cheap labor. Those who fit neither category are, for the most part, left to their own devices, as long as they obey the laws.</English>

		<German>Der Mekara Orden enstand aus einer Sekte von Amuritischen Magiern, die in einem gemeinsamen Traum vereint waren: Himmelfahrt.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Vom Nekromant D'tesh gegr&#252;ndet, arbeiteten sie &#252;ber Jahre im Verborgenen. Sie experimentierten sowohl mit auf dem Schwarzmarkt eingeschmuggelten Sklaven, als auch mit Ausgesto√üenen, die sie manchmal aus Gef&#228;ngnissen holten oder auf der Stra√üe aufsammelten. Irgendwann kam es aufgrund von internen Konflikten innerhalb der Sekte zu Spannungen. D'tesh war nicht gewillt, die von allen angestrebte Macht zu teilen, und behielt das Einod f&#252;r sich, das f&#252;r alle der Schl&#252;ssel zu ihren Tr&#228;umen h&#228;tte sein k&#246;nnen: Das Juwel des Todes.		[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Als die Spannungen zunahmen, zerbrach der Mekara Orden schlie√ülich von innen heraus. D'tesh verlie√ü den Orden, um seine Studien allein fortzusetzen. Mit dem Juwel des Todes in seinem Besitz war der Mekara Orden f&#252;r ihn nutzlos geworden, so da√ü er Jamal Dahkar, einen seiner Rivalen, als Nachfolger zur&#252;cklie√ü. [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Aufgrund der internen Reibereien wurden die Beh&#246;rden auf den Mekara Orden aufmerksam, die Mitglieder wurden nach und nach verhafted, verurteiled und verbannt. Die Mitglieder reisten danach durch die Lande und fanden, wenn sie auch wesentlich h&#228;ufiger vor dem Zorn der Einheimischen fliehen mu√üten, gelegentlich neue Anh&#228;nger.		[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Nach Jahren der Wanderschaft lie√üen sie sich nahe der Grenze zu den Calabim nieder, wo sie mit der Herrscherin diesen Gebiets eine Vereinbarung trafen. Im Gegenzug f&#252;r das gebotene Asyl lehrten sie sie die Wege der Magie, gaben ihr eine einflussreiche und angesehene Stellung innerhalb des Mekara Ordens. Nach und nach &#252;bernahm der Orden dadurch die Alltagsgesch&#228;fte ihrer Provinz, sagte sich von dem Reich der Calabim los und wirtschaftete in Zukunft auf eigene Rechnung.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH] Obwohl sich die niedere Bev&#246;lkerung fast ausschlie√ülich aus Calabim zusammensetzt, finden sich unter den Entscheidungstr&#228;gern nahezu nur Amuriten und nur solche, denen die Geschicke der einfachen Leute v&#246;llig gleichg&#252;ltig sind. Sie sorgen f&#252;r eine ansatzweise Sicherheit und Ausbildung. Wirkliches Interesse am gemeinen Volk zeigen sie jedoch nur, wenn jemand besonders bef&#228;higt oder besonders widerspenstig scheint. In beiden F&#228;llen werden diese Personen aus der Gesellschaft entfernt, im ersten Fall werden sie in den Mekara Orden eingef&#252;hrt, im zweiten Fall in die Sklavenquartiere geschickt, wo sie als Versuchskaninchen oder als billige Arbeitskraft Verwendung finden. Nur diejenigen, die zu keiner dieser beiden Kategorien zugeh&#246;rig sind, werden, zumindest meistens, in Ruhe und sich selbst &#252;berlassen, solange sie sich an die Gesetze halten.</German>
		<Italian>All'inizio l'Ordine Mekara era una cabala di maghi Amurite, uniti da un sogno comune: l'Ascensione.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Fondata dal necromante D'tesh, agirono per anni in segreto, facendo esperimenti su schiavi presi al mercato nero, ed eventuali persone non gradite prese dalle strade o dalle prigioni. Col tempo si svilupparono dei conflitti interni alla cabala, con D'tesh che non intendeva condividere il potere con gli altri e voleva tenere per se ciÚ che poteva essere la chiave per i loro obiettivi: la Gemma della Morte. [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Col crescere delle tensioni interne alla fine l'Ordine Mekara si frammentÚ, con D'tesh andandosene per continuare le sue ricerche per conto suo, ritenendo non aver pi˘ bisogno dell'Ordine Mekara in quanto possedeva la Gemma della Morte, e lasciando uno dei suoi rivali, Jamal Dahkar, al comando. [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]A causa di questo conflitto interno, l'Ordine Mekara f˘ scoperto dalle autorit‡, che arrestÚ, processÚ ed esiliÚ i membri della cabala. Questi ultimi viaggiarono da un paese all'altro, guadagnando qualche occasionale seguace, ma pi˘ spesso attirando su di loro le ire della popolazione locale.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Dopo anni di girovagare si stabilirono in una regione vicino al confine Calabim, dove conclusero un'accordo con il governatore locale. In cambio di protezione ed asilo gli avrebbero insegnato le vie della magia e dato un ruolo di prestigio e potere all'interno dell'Ordine Mekara. Successivamente l'Ordine Mekara assunse il controllo della provincia, staccandosi dalla nazione Calabim e creandone una loro.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Sebbene la gente che governano sia quasi esclusivamente Calabim, coloro che prendono le decisioni sono quasi tutti Amurite, e tutti membri dell'Ordine Mekara, per i quali i cittadini comuni hanno poca importanza. Forniscono inoltre una rudimentale protezione ed educazione, e le sole volte in cui si interessano in maniera maggiore Ë quando qualcuno si dimostra estremamente competente, o li sfida. In entrambi i casi, queste persone vengono fatte sparire dalla circolazione, che sia perchÈ vengono introdotti nell'Ordine Mekara, o buttati nelle baracche degli schiavi, per poi venir usati come cavie o manodopera a basso costo. Coloro che non rientrano in nessuna di queste categorie vengono, per la maggior parte, lasciati stare in pace, purchÈ obbediscano alle leggi.</Italian>

		<English>"It has been several days since I left Junon in the company of these Mekara fellows, and so far, my impression is that I might come to regret my desicion to travel with them. Two of them have spoken to me at length about human and elven anatomy within the last few hours, and the questions they ask makes it quite clear that they don't intend to use what I know for healing. Still, I remain somewhat hopeful that I can sway them in a more... humane direction, given time.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Their ideals are sound, but their methods are questionable at best. Some of the alchemical solutions they have been discussing seem more likely to kill than bring about any improvement, and last night I overheard a discussion about the grafting of new limbs onto living flesh for improved 'performance'. Thankfully, their leader seems much more sensible. He is an interesting man - if it were not for him, I would never have joined with them.

		<German>"Es ist jetzt einige Tage her, da√ü ich Junon in der Gesellschaft dieser Mekara Gef&#228;hrten verlassen habe. Bisher macht es den Eindruck, da√ü ich es bereuen werde, mit ihnen gereist zu sein. Zwei von ihnen haben mir innerhalb der letzten Stundn ausf&#252;hrlich die menschliche und elfische Anatomie erkl&#228;rt, und die Fragen, die sie mir stellen, machen deutlich, da√ü sie meine Heilerf&#228;higkeiten nicht zum Heilen einsetzen wollen.

Die, von ihnen diskutierten, alchemistischen L&#246;sungsvorschl&#228;ge scheinen eher von todbringender als von verbessernder Natur. Letzte Nacht habe ich eine Diskussion mitgeh&#246;rt, in der es um das Anbringen von zus&#228;tzlichen K&#246;rperteilen an lebendes Fleisch ging, zur Verbesserung der 'Leistungsf&#228;higkeit'. Zum Gl&#252;ck scheint ihr Anf&#252;hrer vern&#252;nftiger zu sein. Er ist ein interessanter Mann - wenn es ihn nicht g&#228;be, h&#228;tte ich mich ihnen niemals angeschlossen. Er ist ein fr&#252;herer Erzmagier aus dem Volk der Amuriten, ein Mann mit starken &#252;berzeugungen und hohen Idealen. Sein Traum, und sein Vertrauen in diesen, ist mehr als faszinierend; er ist sch&#246;n: Ausrottung von Krankheiten, Verz&#246;gerung des Alterns und eine Beinahe-Unsterblichkeit, soweit es physische Wunden angeht. Stellt Euch vor, wie das Leben sich f&#252;r alle Lebewesen verbessern w&#252;rde, wenn sein Traum wahr w&#252;rde![NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Ich habe lang und ausf&#252;hrlich mit ihm dar&#252;ber geredet, den Menschen zu helfen, er hat mir zugestimmt, dass dies ein erstrebenswertes Unterfangen ist, obwohl es den Eindruck macht, dass ihm die Leute selbst dabei gar nicht so wichtig sind. Er bot also mir einen Platz im Mekara Orden an und ich ... ich habe ihn angenommen, soweit, auch wenn ich mir Gedanken um den Preis mache, der f&#252;r seinen Traum zu zahlen ist. Es gibt da etwas Hartes und Kaltes in ihm, als empf&#228;nde er f&#252;r nichts als f&#252;r seinen Auftrag. Ich kann nur hoffen, dass er mir auch in Zukunft zuh&#246;ren wird."[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH] - "Auszug aus dem Tagebuch von Iram Damarr, bez&#252;glich Jamal Dahkar."</German>
		<Italian>"Sono passati parecchi giorni da quando ho lasciato Junon in compagnia di questi membri di Mekara e, per ora, ho l'impressione che potrei arrivare a pentirmi della mia decisione di viaggiare con loro. Due di loro hanno parlato con me a lungo dell'anatomia umana e elfica nelle ultime ore, dalle domande che mi hano fatto Ë chiaro che non intendono usare le mie conoscenze per curare. Tuttavia, rimango leggermente speranzoso di poterli far deviare verso... posizioni pi˘ umane, col tempo.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]I loro ideali sono solidi, ma i loro metodi sono discutibili nella migliore delle ipotesi. Alcune delle soluzioni alchemiche di cui stavano discutendo sembravano pi˘ portate ad uccidere che a portare qualsivoglia miglioramento, e la scorsa notte ho sentito una discussione riguardante l'innesto di arti aggiuntivi su esseri viventi per un 'rendimento' maggiore. Fortunatamente il loro leader sembra essere molto pi˘ ragionevole. » un'uomo molto interessante, non fosse stato per lui non mi sarei mai unito a loro. » un ex arcimago del popolo Amurite, ed Ë un uomo di forti convinzioni e alti ideali. Il suo sogno, e la sua fede in esso, Ë pi˘ che affascinante; Ë bellissimo.

Immagina come la vita delle persone potrebbe venir migliorata se il suo sogno venisse realizzato![NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Gli ho parlato a lungo di come portare questo alla gente, e ha concordato che vale la pena provarci, anche se sembra interessarsi poco alle persone.

		<English>Iram felt his frustration building ever higher as he watched the Governor of the city. "It is a wonder the people in the city hasn't starved to death due to her excesses.", he thought as he watched the feast laid out below. Outside in the streets there were children starving, and here in the palace there was a lavish banquet of delicacies from all over the known world assembled for the Mekara Order's pleasure. Meanwhile, the Governor herself was reclining in a throne-like chair surrounded by half-dressed slaves. "A disgrace.", he thought to himself as he watched her. Perhaps something could be done about her later, once the Mekara Order was more firmly entrenched?[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]The night before, the negotiations between Governor Zaria Scheras, of the Calabim city of Korasch, and Jamal Dahkar, had been concluded. The results of that negotiation was that the Mekara Order was welcome to settle in the city, finally giving the Mekara Order a permanent home - something that had been sorely needed. The Governor had also generously promised to supply the Mekara Order with all the reagents and test subjects they needed from the city's trading partners and prisons. What she got out of it, Jamal had not told Iram, but looking at the woman he imagined it had something to do with new ways to pleasure herself. What Jamal had told him, however, was that soon, she would no longer care what happened to the city, and that the Mekara Order would slowly but surely take control, and that Iram would have a role to fill in the new government, if he wanted it. [NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]As much as he hoped this would be the case, he didn't think it would be quite that easy. Zaria was a very clever woman, and very good at manipulating or seducing others to get what she wanted. Despite her excesses, she was also, paradoxically, reasonably well-liked by her people, for reasons that Iram couldn't begin to imagine. "I will have to watch her carefully", he thought to himself, as he wandered off, to find his way back to the Mekara Order's camp.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]As Zaria watched the old healer move away, she smiled to herself. "He won't become a problem.", she thought. "Let him try to run the city and care for the people. They will serve me better in the end, if they are healthy and happy." Jamal would provide her with the tools she would need - mastery over mind magic, and even if control over the city would slip out of her grasp for a time, in the end they would all serve her - in the end they would all love her.

		<German>Iram f&#252;hlte seine Frustration immer gr&#246;√üer werden, w&#228;hrend er die Herrscherin der Stadt beobachtete. "Es ist ein Wunder, dass die Bev&#246;lkerung der Stadt nicht nicht verhungert ist, trotz ihrer Exzesse.", dachte er, als er das Fest in vollem Gange sah. Drau√üen, auf der Stra√üe, verhungerten Kinder und, hier im Palast, wurde zum Vergn&#252;gen des Mekara Ordens ein verschwenderisches Bankett ausgerichtet, mit Delikatessen aus der gesamten, bekannten Welt. W&#228;hrenddessen lehnte sich die Herrscherin selbst in ihrem Thron-&#228;hnlichen Stuhl zur&#252;ck und lie√ü sich von ihren halbbekleideten Sklaven umsorgen. "Eine Schande!", dachte er bei sich, w&#228;hrend er sie so beobachtete. Er w&#252;rde sich vielleicht sp&#228;ter mit ihr befassen, wenn der Mekara Orden erst einmal st&#228;rker verankert w&#228;re.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]In der vorangegangenen Nacht waren die Verhandlungen zwischen Zaria Scheras, der Herrscherin der Calabim Stadt Korasch, und Jamal Dahkar, zu einem Abschluss gekommen. Das Ergebnis dieses &#252;bereinkommens war, da√ü es dem Mekara Orden erlaubt war, sich in der Stadt niederzulassen, wodurch dem Mekara Orden endlich ein st&#228;ndiges Zuhause beschert wurde, was dringend n&#246;tig geworden war. Die Herrscherin hatte gro√üz&#252;gig versprochen, den Orden mit allen Reagenzien und Testsubjekten zu versorgen, die sie ben&#246;tigten: &#252;ber die Handelspartner der Stadt bzw. aus den Gef&#228;ngnissen. Was sie daf&#252;r bekommen sollte, hatte Jamal gegen&#252;ber Iram nicht erw&#228;hnt, aber er sich die Frau so ansah, konnte er sich vorstellen, dass es etwas mit neuen M&#246;glichkeiten zu tun hatte, sich Vergn&#252;gen zu bereiten. Jamal hatte ihm vielmehr erkl&#228;rt, dass Zaria sich bald nicht mehr daf&#252;r interessieren w&#252;rde, was mit der Stadt passierte. Dann w&#252;rde der Mekara Orden langsam aber sicher die Kontrolle &#252;bernehmen, und dann w&#252;rde Iram eine Rolle in der neuen Regierung auszuf&#252;llen haben, wenn er denn wollte.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]So sehr er auch hoffte, dass dies der Fall sein w&#252;rde, glaubte er nicht, dass es so einfach sein w&#252;rde. Zaria war eine &#228;u√üert kluge Frau, um zu bekommen, was sie wollte, konnte sie andere sehr gut verf&#252;hren oder manipulieren. Trotz all ihrer Ausschweifungen war sie paradoxerweise bei ihrem Volk einigerma√üen beliebt, aus Gr&#252;nden, die sich der Vorstellungskraft Irams entzogen. "Ich werde dich sorgf&#228;ltig beobachten m&#252;ssen", dachte er bei sich, als er sich zur&#252;ckzog, um in das Lager des Mekara Ordens zur&#252;ckzufinden.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Als Zaria den alten Heiler weggehen sah, l&#228;chelte sie. "Er wird kein Problem werden.", dacht sie. "Lass ihn ruhig versuchen, die Stadt zu leiten und sich ums Volk zu k&#252;mmern. Sie werden mir dadurch nur besser dienen, wenn sie gesund und gl&#252;cklich sein sollten." Jamal w&#252;rde sie mit der n&#246;tigen Macht ausstatten, der Meisterschaft der Verstandesmagie, und selbst wenn ihr die Kontrolle &#252;ber die Stadt kurzzeitig einmal entgleiten sollte, zum Schluss w&#252;rden alle ihr dienen, w&#252;rden alle sie lieben. Mit vielleicht dem ersten wirklich ernstgemeinten L&#228;cheln dieses Abends, wandte sie sich wieder dem Fest zu.</German>
		<Italian>Iram sentÏ la sua frustrazione crescere mentre osservava la Governatrice della citt‡. "» un miracolo che i cittadini non siano morti di fame per via dei suoi eccessi.", pensÚ mentre osservava il banchetto. Fuori, nelle strade, vi erano bambini che morivano di fame, e qui nel palazzo si svolgeva un sontuoso banchetto, con prelibatezze provenienti da ogni parte del mondo conosciuto, in onore dell'Ordine Mekara. Durante ciÚ, la Governatrice stessa era adagiata su una poltrona simil trono circondata da schiavi mezzo nudi. "Una vergogna.", pensÚ mentra la osservava. Forse si sarebbe potuto fare qualcosa al suo riguardo in seguito, una volta che l'Ordine Mekara si fosse stabilito pi˘ saldamente?[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]La notte prima i negoziati tra la Governatrice Zaria Scheras, della citt‡ Calabim chiamata Korasch, e Jamal Dahkar, erano stati conclusi. L'esito dei negoziati f˘ che l'Ordine Mekara fu invitato a stabilirsi nella citt‡, fornendo infine a quest'ultimo una dimora fissa, una cosa da tempo necessaria. La Governatrice aveva anche generosamente promesso di rifornire l'Ordine Mekara di tutti i reagenti e le cavie necessarie dai partner commerciali e dalle prigioni rispettivamente. Jamal non aveva detto a Iram ciÚ che lei ci guadagnava, ma osservandola Iram pensÚ che fosse qualcosa che avesse a che fare con nuovi modi di divertirsi. Quello che Jamal gli disse perÚ, era che a breve lei non si sarebbe pi˘ preoccupata di ciÚ che succedeva alla citt‡, e che l'Ordine Mekara avrebbe piano piano preso inevitabilmente il potere, e che Iram avrebbe avuto un ruolo da ricoprire nel nuovo governo, se lui avesse voluto.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Per quanto sperasse che le cose andassero cosi, riteneva che non sarebbero stato cosi facile. Zaria era una donna molto intelligente, e molto brava a manipolare o sedurre gli altri per ottenere ciÚ che voleva. Nonostante i suoi eccessi, lei era anche, paradossalmente, ragionevolmente apprezzata dalla sua gente per ragioni che Iram non riusciva a immaginare. "DevrÚ sorvegliarla attentamente", pensÚ tra sÈ, mentre si allontanava per tornare al campo dell'Ordine Mekara.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Mentre Zaria osservava il vecchio guaritore allontanarsi, sorrise. "Lui non sar‡ un problema.", pensÚ. "Che provi a gestire la citt‡ e prendersi cura delle persone. Mi saranno pi˘ utili alla fine, se saranno in salute e felici." Jamal gli avrebbe fornito gli strumenti di cui necessitava, la padronanza della magia della mente, e se anche il controllo della citt‡ gli sfuggisse di mano per un pÚ, alla fine tutti avrebbero servito lei, alla fine tutti la avrebbero amata. Con quello che sarebbe potuto essere il primo sorriso sincero della serata tornÚ al banchetto.</Italian>

While he disliked the cruel methods they use, he feels that their goal is worthwhile, and that the fruits of their labour will one day bring about a new age for the common people of Erebus.</Spanish>

		<English>As Corgayle entered the room which the city's new master had made into his office, he noticed how sparsely decorated it was. He remembered seeing Governor Zaria's rooms once, back before the Mekara Order had arrived. They had been lavishly decorated - gold and silk; paintings and statues - a picture of wasted wealth that had infuriated him when he considered the squalor that he and his family had been forced to endure for his entire life. This man was clearly a different sort. Corgayle had heard little about him; very little, truth be told, considering that he was the true ruler of the city now. His eyes swept over the man sitting by the desk in front of him. Thin, gaunt, with pale skin and dark hair, shot through with grey. Simple, practical clothes, without any visible adornments. All in all not a man one would expect to be ruling a city, much less a nation. But there was something in the way he held himself, an unmistakable air of command that could not be ignored.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"Sit.", the man said, indicating a chair sitting opposite him, his head still lowered as he was reading from a paper lying on the desk. Corgayle sat down in the chair, somewhat apprehensive about what was to come. The man raised his head, looking at Corgayle for the first time. His eyes were hard and cold, with a strange shine to them, as if fires played far behind them. "Iram tells me that you've been causing us trouble.", he said, in a calm tone that betrayed no emotion, "I am Jamal Dahkar, the Master of the Mekara Order", he continued, "and your life belongs to me now."[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Corgayle shivered under that gaze. "The offer I am about to give you is not one I give to just any criminals that break the laws of my nation." he said, still holding Corgayle's eyes with his own, "I am going to give you the chance to determine the course of your life." Corgayle braced himself for what he knew would come. He had seen it before, during the days when the Governor ruled. Slavery or death. A quick death, or a slow, torturous one. Jamal continued, "The Order will see to your needs; we will see to it that you have everything you could want. In return, we want you to lead our warriors."[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Corgayle started. He wondered if he'd heard that right, or if it'd just been his imagination. "I led one of the most powerful street-gangs this city has seen", he thought, "I've extorted businesses. I've robbed and killed countless people. And this man is offering me a life of luxury for it? And command over their soldiers?" "What?" he stuttered.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Jamal smiled. "As I said, this is not an offer I would give to just anyone. You have potential; your 'work' in the city clearly shows that." He leaned forward, and his voice grew more intense, "We have need of men like you; intelligent and practical men, who knows how to do what is neccessary." Corgayle was stunned. "Why?", he said, his mind racing. "Our work requires a continous supply of subjects for our experiments." Jamal said, in a calmer, more relaxed tone, "and we want you to get them for us." He smiled, and that smile sent chills down Corgayle's spine. "You will train and lead our forces; you will conduct raids on our enemies, and you will bring them back to us, reasonably intact."[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"Do I have a choice?", Corgayle asked. Jamal Dahkar simply smiled at him.</English>

		<Italian>Mentre Corgayle entrava nella stanza che il nuovo signore della citt‡ aveva reso il suo ufficio notÚ quanto scarsamente decorato fosse. Ricordava di aver visto le stanze della Governatrice Zaria tempo fa, quando l'Ordine Mekara non era ancora arrivato. Quelle erano riccamente decorate, con seta e oro; dipinti e statue, uno spreco di ricchezza che lo aveva fatto infuriare quando considerÚ lo squallore che lui e la sua famiglia avevano dovuto sopportare per tutta la loro vita. Quest'uomo era chiaramente diverso. Corgayle aveva sentito poco sul suo conto; molto poco veramente, considerando che lui era ora il vero governatore della citt‡. I suoi occhi si posarono sull'uomo seduto alla scrivania di fronte a lui. Magro, scarno, con pelle chiara e capelli scuri, con ciuffi grigi. Abiti semplici e pratici, senza ornamenti visibili. Tutto sommato non uno che ci si aspetterebbe governi una citt‡, tanto meno una nazione. Ma vi era qualcosa nel suo modo di fare, un'inconfondibile aria di comando che non poteva essere ignorata.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"Sedete.", l'uomo disse, indicando una sedia davanti a lui, la sua testa ancora china mentre leggeva qualcosa da un foglio sulla scrivania. Corgayle si sedette sulla sedia un pÚ preoccupato per ciÚ che sarebbe successo. L'uomo alzÚ la testa, guardando Corgayle per la prima volta. I suoi occhi erano duri e freddi, con una strana luce in essi, come se vi fosse una fiamma distante dietro. "Iram mi ha detto che ci stai creando dei problemi.", disse, in tono calmo senza alcuna emozione, "Io sono Jamal Dahkar, il Maestro dell'Ordine Mekara", continuÚ, "e la tua vita appartiene a me ora."[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Corgayle rabbrividÏ sotto quello sguardo. "L'offerta che ti sto per fare non Ë una che farei a qualsiasi criminale che infrange le leggi della mia nazione." disse, mantenendo il contatto visivo con gli occhi di Corgayle, "Ti darÚ la possibilit‡ di determinare il corso della tua vita." Corgayle si preparÚ per ciÚ che sapeva stava arrivando. Ci era gi‡ passato, quando regnava la Governatrice. Schiavit˘ o morte. Una veloce, o una lenta e tortuosa. Jamal continuÚ, "L'Ordine si occuperebbe dei tuoi bisogni; faremo in modo che tu abbia tutto ciÚ che potresti volere. In cambio, vogliamo che guidi i nostri guerrieri."[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Corgayle trasalÏ. Si chiese se avesse sentito bene, o se fosse stata la sua immaginazione. "Io guido una delle bande di strada pi˘ potenti che questa citt‡ abbia visto", pensÚ, "Ho compiuto estorsioni. Ho derubato e ucciso innumerevoli persone. E quest'uomo mi sta offrendo una vita di lusso per questo? E di comandare i suoi soldati?" "Cosa?" balbettÚ.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Jamal sorrise. "Come ho detto, questa non Ë un'offerta che farei a chiunque. Hai del potenziale; il tuo 'lavoro' in citt‡ lo dimostra chiaramente." Si sporse in avanti, e la sua voce si fece pi˘ intensa, "Abbiamo bisogno di uomini come te; uomini intelligenti e concreti, che sanno come fare ciÚ che Ë necessario." Corgayle era sbalordito. "PerchÈ?", disse, la sua mente in subbuglio. "Il nostro lavoro richiede un rifornimento costante di esemplari per i nostri esperimenti." Jamal disse, con un tono pi˘ calmo e rilassato, "e noi vogliamo che tu li prenda per noi." Sorrise, e quel sorriso fece rabbrividire Corgayle. "Tu addestrerai e guiderai le nostre forze; effettuerai incursioni contro i nostri nemici, e li porterai da noi, ragionevolmente intatti."[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"Ho scelta?", Corgayle chiese. Jamal Dahkar gli sorrise soltanto.</Italian>

		<English>As the ritual finished, he felt himself dropping to the floor. Dazed, he tried to stand, but only succeeded at the second attempt. He looked down on his body - his body - and wondered who he had become. He was no taller than he had been before, but he was more muscular, and his body felt somehow too flexible, as he moved around, trying to regain his balance. The scars of old wounds he had taken in slave raids over the years were disappearing before his eyes, old aches were fading so quickly he almost thought he'd imagined them all those years.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]He looked up, trying to center himself, and looked at the people assembled around him. Seven figures stood arrayed in front of him, watching him. He heard a voice, trembling slightly with anticipation.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"Were we successful?" it asked.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"Yes." said another, this one cold and hard as stone. "At least, it would seem so. How do you feel?"[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]He swung his head in the direction of the second voice, and looked at the figure standing in front of him. Jamal. His vision was clearing up. He could see the seven more clearly now. Rough, practical clothing, few adornments, faces scarred and tired, all but one tense with anticipation. He looked at them, and found that he was "aware" of them in ways he didn't remember. He could hear the beats of their hearts from the other side of the room; could smell their scent, and could "feel" them standing there, even with his eyes closed. He could feel power emanating from them, like waves flowing outward, each one a different flavour. He started to speak.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"I feel...", he began, "...different."[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]He looked around, and his eyes caught a chair standing against the nearby wall. He looked at it - "felt" it standing there, like a hard object pressing against his mind. He reached out with his thoughts, and grabbed on to it, and saw it lift into the air. He focused on the chair, pressing aginst it with all the concentration he could muster. The splinters flew halfway across the room, and he registered surprise and excitement on some of the the faces before him.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"Good." continued Jamal, stepping forward to examine him more closely, "Your body seems to be regenerating; exellent.", he continued, "We will have to keep you under observation for some time, of course, to make sure there are no adverse side effects. I expect..."[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Corgayle stopped listening. He looked at the other mages, who were finally starting to relax, realising that they had been successful. Relief, and excitement registered on their faces as they took their leave, and Corgayle cast his mind back to when he had first met this group. He smiled to himself. "They would never have believed that I could come this far." he thought to himself. "Arrogant bastards."[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]He looked down at his new body again. "Strange", he thought, "but I can get used to it." As he looked out over the city outside the windows, he considered the path that had taken him to this place. His childhood on the streets of the town where he'd been born; his time training under the sadistic bastard he'd called his father; to the time when he had finally showed him how quickly he learned, and displaced him as the leader of his gang, leaving him in a shallow grave. "No", he thought, and looked at Jamal, "This is my father now". He was no longer the man he had been only an hour ago. He was new. Reborn. Ascended.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]And as that thought crossed his mind, he could feel the memories of his past slipping away, fading. And he smiled.</English>

		<Italian>Al termine del rituale si senti venir poggiato sul pavimento. Frastornato cercÚ di rialzarsi, ma ci riuscÏ solo al secondo tentativo. AbbassÚ lo sguardo sul suo corpo, e si chiese chi fosse diventato. Non era pi˘ alto di prima, ma era pi˘ muscoloso, e il suo corpo sembrava in qualche modo pi˘ flessibile mentre cercava di ritrovare l'equilibrio. Le cicatrici di vecchie ferite subite durante le incursioni compiute negli anni stavano svanendo davanti ai suoi occhi, e i dolori dovuti all'et‡ stavano sparendo cosÏ rapidamente che quasi pensÚ se li fosse immaginati per tutti questi anni.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]AlzÚ lo sguardo e guardÚ le persone che si stavano assemblando attorno a lui. Sette figure gli stavano attorno, guardandolo. SentÏ una voce con una leggera vena di eccitazione.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"Abbiamo avuto successo?" chiese.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"Si." disse un'altro, questa voce fredda e dura come la pietra. "Perlomeno sembrerebbe cosi. Come ti senti?"[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]VoltÚ la testa verso la direzione della seconda voce e osservÚ la figura che aveva di fornte. Jamal. La sua vista si stava schiarendo. Poteva vedere le figure pi˘ chiaramente ora. Vestiti pratici, pochi ornamenti, facce stanche e sfregiate, tutte tranne una piene di eccitazione. Le osservÚ, e si rese conto di essere "cosciente" di loro in una maniera che non si ricordava. Poteva sentire il battito dei loro cuori dalla parte opposta della stanza; poteva sentire il loro odore, e poteva "percepirli" li in piedi, anche con gli occhi chiusi. Poteva sentire il potere emanato da loro, come onde che si allontanano da un epicentro, ognuna con un aroma diverso. IniziÚ a parlare.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"Mi sento...", iniziÚ, "...diverso."[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Si guardÚ intorno e vide una sedia poggiata al muro. La guardÚ, la "percepiva" li, come un oggetto duro che gli preme contro la mente. La raggiunse col pensiero e la afferrÚ, e la vide sollevarsi in aria. Si concentrÚ su di essa, pressandola con tutta la concentrazione che riusciva ad avere. I frammenti volarono sino a met‡ della stanza, e notÚ sorpresa ed eccitazione in alcune delle facce che aveva davanti.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"Bene." continuÚ Jamal, avvicinandosi per esaminarlo meglio, "Il tuo corpo sembra si stia rigenerando; eccellente.", continuÚ, "Dovremo tenerti sotto osservazione per un po di tempo, ovviamente, per assicurarci che non vi siano effetti collaterali negativi. Mi aspetto..."[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Corgayle smise di ascoltare. OsservÚ gli altri maghi, che stavano infine iniziando a rilassarsi mentre si rendevono conto che avevano avuto successo. Sollievo ed eccitazione erano presenti sulle loro facce quando si congedavano, e Corgayle ripensÚ a quando aveva incontrato questo gruppo per la prima volta. Sorrise. "Non avrebbero mai creduto che sarei potuto arrivare cosi lontano." pensÚ. "Bastardi arroganti."[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]GuardÚ di nuovo il suo nuovo corpo. "Strano", pensÚ, "ma mi ci posso abituare." Mentre osservava la citt‡ fuori dalla finestra considerÚ il percorso che lo aveva portato sin qui. La sua infanzia per le strade della citt‡ dove era nato; il tempo passato ad addestrarsi con quel sadico bastardo che chiamava padre; sino al momento in cui gli aveva infine dimostrato quanto rapidamente aveva appreso, e lo sostituÏ come capo della sua banda, lasciandolo in una fossa poco profonda. "No", pensÚ, e guardÚ a Jamal, "Lui Ë mio padre adesso". Non era pi˘ l'uomo che era un ora fa. Era nuovo. Rinato. Asceso.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]E mentre quel pensiero gli attraversava la mente percepiva i ricordi del suo passato scivolare via, svanire. E sorrise.</Italian>
		<Spanish>As the ritual finished, he felt himself dropping to the floor. Dazed, he tried to stand, but only succeeded at the second attempt. He looked down on his body - his body - and wondered who he had become. He was no taller than he had been before, but he was more muscular, and his body felt somehow too flexible, as he moved around, trying to regain his balance. The scars of old wounds he had taken in slave raids over the years were disappearing before his eyes, old aches were fading so quickly he almost thought he'd imagined them all those years.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]He looked up, trying to center himself, and looked at the people assembled around him. Seven figures stood arrayed in front of him, watching him. He heard a voice, trembling slightly with anticipation.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"Were we successful?" it asked.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"Yes." said another, this one cold and hard as stone. "At least, it would seem so. How do you feel?"[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]He swung his head in the direction of the second voice, and looked at the figure standing in front of him. Jamal. His vision was clearing up. He could see the seven more clearly now. Rough, practical clothing, few adornments, faces scarred and tired, all but one tense with anticipation. He looked at them, and found that he was "aware" of them in ways he didn't remember. He could hear the beats of their hearts from the other side of the room; could smell their scent, and could "feel" them standing there, even with his eyes closed. He could feel power emanating from them, like waves flowing outward, each one a different flavour. He started to speak.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"I feel...", he began, "...different."[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]He looked around, and his eyes caught a chair standing against the nearby wall. He looked at it - "felt" it standing there, like a hard object pressing against his mind. He reached out with his thoughts, and grabbed on to it, and saw it lift into the air. He focused on the chair, pressing aginst it with all the concentration he could muster. The splinters flew halfway across the room, and he registered surprise and excitement on some of the the faces before him.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"Good." continued Jamal, stepping forward to examine him more closely, "Your body seems to be regenerating; exellent.", he continued, "We will have to keep you under observation for some time, of course, to make sure there are no adverse side effects. I expect..."[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Corgayle stopped listening. He looked at the other mages, who were finally starting to relax, realising that they had been successful. Relief, and excitement registered on their faces as they took their leave, and Corgayle cast his mind back to when he had first met this group. He smiled to himself. "They would never have believed that I could come this far." he thought to himself. "Arrogant bastards."[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]He looked down at his new body again. "Strange", he thought, "but I can get used to it." As he looked out over the city outside the windows, he considered the path that had taken him to this place. His childhood on the streets of the town where he'd been born; his time training under the sadistic bastard he'd called his father; to the time when he had finally showed him how quickly he learned, and displaced him as the leader of his gang, leaving him in a shallow grave. "No", he thought, and looked at Jamal, "This is my father now". He was no longer the man he had been only an hour ago. He was new. Reborn. Ascended.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]And as that thought crossed his mind, he could feel the memories of his past slipping away, fading. And he smiled.</Spanish>

		<English>On their own, the Sluga are, despite their great endurance and strength, barely capable of conscious thought. While this does make them incapable of betrayal or disobedience, it also makes them useless.

		<English>Zaria Scheras was never your usual Calabim governor. Whereas most of her peers preferred to rule through intimidation and military strength, she always favoured a more subtle approach. Her Agents could be found in every city and village in her domain, strategically placed to find any and all who conspire against her. Highly skilled at avoiding detection, and strong enough to escape if they failed, Zaria often used them against her fellow Governors, to advance her political standing. With the coming of the Mekara Order and the establishment of the new Mekaran nation, their services are in more demand than ever, and their numbers have grown considerably. They have also found new ways to utilize their vampyric nature, drawing life from those they kill in battle, growing stronger with every foe they slay.</English>

		<Italian>Zaria Scheras non Ë mai stata la classica governatrice Calabim. Laddove i suoi pari preferivano governare attraverso l'intimidazione e la potenza militare lei ha sempre preferito un approccio pi˘ discreto. I suoi Agenti sono presenti in ogni citt‡ e villaggio dei suoi domini, in posizioni strategiche per scoprire chiunque conspiri contro di lei. Esperti nel non farsi scoprire, e sufficentemente forti per scappare se fallissero, Zaria li usava spesso contro gli altri governatori per migliorare la sua posizione. Con l'arrivo dell'Ordine Mekara e l'istituzione della nuova nazione Mekara i loro servizi sono pi˘ richiesti che mai, e i loro numeri sono cresciuti considerevolmente. Hanno inoltre trovato nuovi modi di utilizzare la loro natura vampirica, assorbendo la vita delle persone che uccidono in battaglia, diventando pi˘ forti con ogni nemico che uccidono.</Italian>

Most of the Order's members take the position that the end goal is all that is relevant, but some would argue otherwise. Iram Damarr is one of those who do. Not content to wait or search for the final form of humanity promised by the Order, he has begun using the extensive body of knowledge regarding human enhancement to gradually improve the human condition.
