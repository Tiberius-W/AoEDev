		<German>Valin stellt eines der Bollwerke gegen das Armageddon dar und hat daher bereits viel in seinem Leben durchgemacht, und er wei&#223;, dass er noch weitaus mehr durchzumachen hat. Er sucht schnell den Kampf, da er wei&#223;, dass viele Probleme im Keim erstickt werden k&#246;nnen, wenn man schnell und unbarmherzig vorgeht. Dann, ja dann, verhindert man die Eskalation vieler unangenehmer Situationen.</German>
		<Italian>One of the Bulwarks against Armageddon, Valin has seen much in his life, and realizes that he shall see far more.  He is quick to seek out battle for he realizes that if dealt with quickly and ruthlessly, he can save things from escalating beyond control.</Italian>
