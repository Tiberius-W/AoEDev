		<English>As one of the lizardkin in the city, life had not been easy. Sure, the Elohim were renowned for their tolerance and pity. But in all earnest, humans are smelly, discolored and damp - compared to Azzar's kin's smooth and shiny exterior, with scales colored to match any jewel or shiny trinket sold in the dwarven quarter. Of course, the humans, elves and other skinlings in the city over time developed a jealousy. After all, they were only mammals. Azzar had been one of the first lizardkin to join the city watch, what better place to learn how to protect oneself. In the barracks there had been less abuse and taunting then on the streets. His talent with bow and spear had helped, and the respect he built had served him well on patrols. Few now dared to throw the casual snake-joke at him. But the situation he now faced was something no training had ever prepared him for. Pressed up against the wall of the towering customs building - he was alone facing a better part of the port district's inhabitants, mixed with the local rascals and gang members. The city had burned for days, consumed by its own anger and confusion. Two days prior the smokehouse went up in flames and hunger was added to the mix. He had known then, as had his comrades which now occupied beds in the medical post, that the city would face a total breakdown of order. Azzar's unit had been sent down to the port district to protect whatever food stocks remained. He was now the only one left. Some of his comrades in arms had just left to protect their families in the chaos. Other fell to the random stone that the shield arm was to slow to counter. Azzar was alone and the mob in front. He studied their faces. Many he knew, bakers and sailors, ladies of pleasure and men of the sword. They look frightened and crazed. He felt the adrenaline pump in his ears. His heavy breathing the only thing cleansing his body from all the excess heat created by tense muscles and a galloping heart. He decided. With one arm he removed his guard helmet, custom made by the city's best blacksmith to fit around his elongated skull. He raised it far above his head. And screamed the loudest his lungs could muster. The crowd gasped and stepped back slightly. Azzar spun around and threw the helmet through the nearest window of the customs house, glass shattering in a cascade of shards. The mob let out an approving roar - fist raised. He was one of them now. Not lizardkin or city guard. Just a normal, frightened soul trying to survive one more night of chaos. That night the port district burned.</English>

The tune was forever etched in his mind, intertwined with happy memories of curiosity and the marvel of mechanical exploration. Walvos was old now, and the master long gone, and he had a multitude of apprentices of his own. For almost a decade he had himself been the master of the Mechanics guild in the Mechanos capital. But the prestige of the position meant little to him, especially now as the lust for social interaction had long subsided. But the receptions and parties that was expected of the position was a small price to pay for full autonomy in discovery and creation. His mind was still sharp and the love of the machines larger than ever. Before him lay the metal exoskeleton of something he proudly would describe as a mechanical swallow, perfectly adapted for glide flight but strong enough to catch an upwind and stay airborne for hours. It was beautiful. He had worked on the design for years, a deadly bird of prey capable of dropping small vials of wildfire or poison. Maybe not strategically important in most situations, but surprise attacks from above could demoralize or confuse any enemy. If just the damn ratchet outside the guild house could subside so he could continue to work in peace. Suddenly the door sprang open and two apprentices lunged into the chamber. "Master, the mob! They are throwing torches through our windows, we must go". In terror, Walvos hunkered down over the swallow, and refused to let it go as he was dragged from the room by the students. The hall was already on fire. He saw books and blueprints set alight. Tears started to stream down his face as the portrait of the old masters lining the walls crumbled in the heat. As Walvos was removed out the back door, the smoke made it impossible to keep his old watery eyes open. Blinded, the only thing he could hear over the screams of the mob was the roaring fire, with sounds so familiar - snap, cricle and puff.</English>

		<English>It was not the first time, nor would it be the last, that Rardos found himself in a courtroom. This one was quite unrepresentative and showed little indication of being a hall of law. Probably just some kind of communal meeting room for various purposes - and tonight it was the seat of a judicial hearing. Or a farce, if you were to ask Rardos. It had been so predictable, and he was actually quite ashamed that he had not seen in coming straight away when he rode into the ocean side hamlet. Rardos travelling carnival troupe had not even set up their tents before a group of ruffians approached him. "You are this groups leader I presume?", they asked and Rardos had nodded, while his merry band slowly stopped tent razing and grabbed assorted equipment usable in a fight. The surprisingly articulate gang leader, with arms adorned by a large kraken and other major crustaceans, informed him that this was a dangerous town and he offered "some protections for the entire group and lot, you know thieves and drowns plague the nights here". All it would cost was coin, and actually profoundly more than the usual fee. The audacity, just ignoring the going rate! He had tried to haggle some, arguing for the usual rate along these shores, but the leader had been unimpressed and when the group became aggressive Rardos had just turned around and walked into his tent. The last shout had been ominous - "I would not leave this lot you'all, the city is not safe for your kind". Of course, no one had been allowed to leave and the guard shifts had been doubled. The next day, a local official showed up. There had been a robbery in town, and the assailant had worn a red tunica with golden embroidery and spoken with a foreign accent. Rardos tried to argue that it would be absurd for one of his performers to rob someone clothed in his performance attire, but to no avail. He was ordered to show up the next day at the courthouse - or the issue could be settled straight away by coin. The price had now risen 50% since the day before. Rardos again refused and the official turned around fuming. Rardos immediately ordered the company to prepare a hasty departure in the night. As the tents began to come down in the dusk light, Rardos was informed that campfires was alit just outside their compound with gang members merrily singing tunes praising the Octopus Overlords while sharing kegs of rum. There were to be no easy departure, they could fight their way out but at what cost? Better to stand down and hope for some reprieve in court. A sudden slam from a heavy door indicated that the presiding lawman had arrived and Rardos arose. Turned out that this was not the Lanun way, as everyone else remained seated. He sat down again and looked up. The man holding the gavel opposite him was the very same official he had meet the day before. Rardos mood sank.[NEWLINE] There would be no justice here.</English>
		<French>It was not the first time, nor would it be the last, that Rardos found himself in a courtroom. This one was quite unrepresentative and showed little indication of being a hall of law. Probably just some kind of communal meeting room for various purposes - and tonight it was the seat of a judicial hearing. Or a farce, if you were to ask Rardos.

		<English>An aching neck was not something that Dinarte appreciated, nor any ache anywhere as a matter of fact. But pain was more or less the norm these days. Who to blame but himself, he thought - unconsciously rubbing his protruding belly. It's been years, even decades, since he last ventured into the border plains. He had been a marvel of physique then, chiseled, strong and with unending breath. Now, old age, lazy living and a unquenching lust for sauces had left him. well. fat. Ha!, he giggled at the thought but quickly found composure. This was a moment of celebration, of him, and the cities entire elite was before him - silently contemplating the boring speech the ecclesiastic on the podium next to Dianarte had now held for 10 minutes. The source of the neck ache was hanging in a silver chain around his neck. Another golden idol of the Empyrean- celebrating Dinarte's latest donation to the church. Philanthropy was an easier living than migration facilitator of the steppes, that much he could acknowledge. Now he had a band of men and women facilitating the actual immigration, while he and his lieutenants planned in crimson halls. The migration part of Dinarte's merchant empire was today just one of many enterprises. He owned maybe a third of the taverns and inns in the city, and the most beautiful gambling house of the entire south shore was his. But, the migration had started it all. While he hated the Sheaim, he had much to thank their crazed ideology for. First it was the dwarven refugees from the scorched mine lands, followed by formerly enslaved servants of the host, when that particular warmaster finally was defeated. But more Sheaim armies continued to stream out from their cursed lands, striking without plan in every direction. Every new conflict brought fresh waves of panicked families to the steppes - to either die by cold, hunger or barbarian - or find salvation by coin guaranteeing safe passage. How many untold lives Dinarte had saved during the years only the Gods knew. He had not only provided the shore cities with workforce to settle the riverbanks, but also dwarfs for the forges, elves for academies and libraries and the followers or Order to the militias. When he was young there had been a single temple dedicated to one set of Gods, now there were a multitude - every dawn bringing a holy day for someone. The ecclesiastic finally finished, and the crowd applauded dutifully. It was his turn to enter the podium and give thanks. His neck ached, could someone tell the finesmith that there are lighter materials than gold - shiny things of excessive weight he had plenty. Before him stood people of every color and creed, and he felt good. Soon another war would start and more would be added to the mix. There would not be an end to profit anytime soon.</English>

		<English>Perpentach escapes death by transferring his mind into a younger host every few decades. He then kills the old body. But one of those bodies survived and dragged itself out of the pit of corpses it was dropped into.[NEWLINE]That surviving version of Perpentach wears a mask and has adopted the persona of the Red Jester. He is unwilling to go through the process to transfer his mind again, and terrified that Perpentach will discover him and come back to finish the job.[NEWLINE]His insanity and sadism leads him to running one of the most hidden (and sought after) underground performances in Jubilee, the Carnival of Knives. Although relatively small, with just a few acts, the artistry and cruelty are unsurpassed. The Red Jester uses mind control to force his performers (most of which are dead by the end) through shocking and beautiful displays. Such as the man who consumes himself, the failed escape, and the transforming man (who cuts himself into a bird type creature). Between performances the Red Jester prowls the back alleys of Jubilee to find and dominate new performers to replace those he lost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perpentach shuddered on the floor. He pinched his eyes shut and covered his ears in an attempt to drown out the outside world. What was going on in his mind was enough. The memories of a hundred lifetimes were pouring into him. Every memory was being recalled while the lens through which he viewed them was being reforged. He was inside a kaleidoscope of endless, tumbling, crashing scenes of joy and tragedy.[NEWLINE]He was Samual, an acrobat with a love of rum. Under its heady guidance he was calm and sure, dancing on wires or the backs of galloping horses with ease. But without it the world scraped against him like biting sand. In Samual's mind the world was fixed and distant, like a land across an ocean, things happened there but it was generally unchanged while he was consumed with the discomforts of his own life.[NEWLINE]That was a dozen lifetimes ago, another rebirth of Perpentach, another who had gone through this process and awoken as the Momus king. But Samual's thoughts and memories were included with all the others, and he still screamed for a drink.[NEWLINE]He was one of hundreds. One was Pau, a mute artist that had never spoken until the rebirth had unlocked his tongue. Osso, A murderer who began by avenging those who were abused, and when he ran out of victims became less picky about those he killed. Keter, a hateful underling who almost managed to assassinate Perpentach, until the Momus transferred into him before he died. Arn, a young boy prone to depression and thoughts of suicide. Vinner, A personable Foxman who always hated that the Momus rarely traveled.[NEWLINE]It was as the murderous Osso that he judged the weakness of fawning Keter, always taking abuse from Perpentach, crying in secret, comforting himself for years with imagined revenge while doing nothing about it. As Vinner he pitied the sullen Arn as family and few friends attempted to offer encouragement but eventually faded to their own lives and left Arn to the gray emptiness of his own.[NEWLINE]He was, at the same time, a traveler with a lifetime of stories from bold adventures and a timid recluse, tormented and beaten by the world until it terrified him. He was an enthusiastic womanizer, a scandalous uranian and an asexual sadist who was only excited by causing pain.[NEWLINE]He waited, but the spinning in his head never stopped. Instead he grew accustomed to it. He opened his eyes and saw the dimly lit throne room. It had only been minutes since he was standing here as. he couldn't remember, there were a hundred voices in his head. One was probably that of his former life, but it was buried under everything that was new.[NEWLINE]The first epiphany from all of these new experiences wasn't wisdom, there was no universal lessons to be learned from all of these lives. Be good and good things will come to you. no. The cruel will get what they deserve in the end. no. There was no path to success or happiness, just empty ideologies adopted to provide comfort. Though the world was viewed through many lives, the world stayed the same. Where some saw hope, others saw despair. Where some were richly rewarded for their efforts, others suffered regardless of their choices. Life was random.[NEWLINE]It was so blatantly absurd that he couldn't help but laugh. Hundreds of useless intentions, sacrifices for no reason, endless ideals. The world was full of kittens all chasing imaginary strings.[NEWLINE]The laughter echoed in his head. He laughed until his lungs burned in his chest, his cheeks ached and his lips split and cracked. When he finally drew himself up off the floor he was gasping for breath, still overcome with small tremors of chuckles and twitches in his face.[NEWLINE]There was a reward for this process, a drink, Blood God wine. A treat he only allowed himself on these days. It was a sacred pact he made with himself, and he broke frequently. But despite his transgressions he also had a drink on the days he was reborn. And it always seemed sweeter on these days, maybe because it was the first time these lips would taste it.[NEWLINE]There it sat on a random end table set in the throne room. A bottle and a single glass next to a large mirror. But first, some voice within his mind reminded him, he had a task to do.[NEWLINE]Turning he saw himself sitting on the gilded bench he was currently using as a throne. Well, what he knew himself to be. An old man with milky eyes and deep wrinkles in his face. His skin would be splotchy and discolored if not for the unevenly applied white paste all over it. His clothes were bright and new, he had just picked them out for today. The colorful harlequin's crown he normally wore was sitting beside him on the bench, leaving his thinning unruly hair poking unevenly up about his head.[NEWLINE]"I thought the voices would go with you?" the old clown said. "I thought I could rest, but they are still here. I don't think it worked, I haven't changed at all."[NEWLINE]"Really?" the reborn Perpentach said as he admired himself in the mirror. He was all lean muscle and confidence. He must have had a beard because even through the white paste he also wore, he could see the bloodied cuts from shaving, some of which had reopened and bled down his face from the laughter.[NEWLINE]"Yes, I am still Perpentach." the old clown said.[NEWLINE]And this made him brutally angry. He was up on the dais like a bear protecting its den. He ripped the old clown off the bench and slammed him easily onto the ground.[NEWLINE]"Don't kill me!" the old Perpentach screamed. "I am you. I am Henri, and Pau and Vinner. You will be me in forty years."[NEWLINE]The new Perpentach stared down at the old. Had he really been that old and feeble? He thought he had been powerful, the Balseraph court catered to his every whim. But this saggy clown laying on the floor in front of him looked like an imposter in his clothes.[NEWLINE]He sat down the old man's chest. The old clown attempted to struggle but was too weak to do anything. He knocked his arms aside and squeezed his neck with his young, strong hands. He squeezed tighter as the old clowns face turned blue, squeezed tighter when the voices screamed for blood, squeezed tighter as he poured all of his self-loathing into his old battered body.[NEWLINE]Overall, it was a very cathartic experience. He regretted the fact others aren't able to kill themselves (at this thought they all laughed at poor suicidal Arn). It cleanses the palette, opening the mind to new opportunities and casts off former guilt and doubt. He reminded himself to suggest it to others who looked sad.[NEWLINE]And he still had his Blood God wine to look forward to. He poured it, sat in his garish bench throne and propped his feet up on the corpse that lay in front of it and wondered what this life would bring.</English>

As Vinner he pitied the sullen Arn as family and few friends attempted to offer encouragement but eventually faded to their own lives and left Arn to the gray emptiness of his own.[NEWLINE]He was, at the same time, a traveler with a lifetime of stories from bold adventures and a timid recluse, tormented and beaten by the world until it terrified him. He was an enthusiastic womanizer, a scandalous uranian and an asexual sadist who was only excited by causing pain.[NEWLINE]He waited, but the spinning in his head never stopped. Instead he grew accustomed to it. He opened his eyes and saw the dimly lit throne room. It had only been minutes since he was standing here as. he couldn't remember, there were a hundred voices in his head. One was probably that of his former life, but it was buried under everything that was new.[NEWLINE]The first epiphany from all of these new experiences wasn't wisdom, there was no universal lessons to be learned from all of these lives. Be good and good things will come to you. no. The cruel will get what they deserve in the end. no. There was no path to success or happiness, just empty ideologies adopted to provide comfort. Though the world was viewed through many lives, the world stayed the same. Where some saw hope, others saw despair. Where some were richly rewarded for their efforts, others suffered regardless of their choices. Life was random.[NEWLINE]It was so blatantly absurd that he couldn't help but laugh. Hundreds of useless intentions, sacrifices for no reason, endless ideals. The world was full of kittens all chasing imaginary strings.[NEWLINE]The laughter echoed in his head. He laughed until his lungs burned in his chest, his cheeks ached and his lips split and cracked. When he finally drew himself up off the floor he was gasping for breath, still overcome with small tremors of chuckles and twitches in his face.[NEWLINE]There was a reward for this process, a drink, Blood God wine. A treat he only allowed himself on these days. It was a sacred pact he made with himself, and he broke frequently. But despite his transgressions he also had a drink on the days he was reborn. And it always seemed sweeter on these days, maybe because it was the first time these lips would taste it.[NEWLINE]There it sat on a random end table set in the throne room. A bottle and a single glass next to a large mirror. But first, some voice within his mind reminded him, he had a task to do.[NEWLINE]Turning he saw himself sitting on the gilded bench he was currently using as a throne. Well, what he knew himself to be. An old man with milky eyes and deep wrinkles in his face. His skin would be splotchy and discolored if not for the unevenly applied white paste all over it. His clothes were bright and new, he had just picked them out for today. The colorful harlequin's crown he normally wore was sitting beside him on the bench, leaving his thinning unruly hair poking unevenly up about his head.[NEWLINE]"I thought the voices would go with you?" the old clown said. "I thought I could rest, but they are still here. I don't think it worked, I haven't changed at all."[NEWLINE]"Really?" the reborn Perpentach said as he admired himself in the mirror. He was all lean muscle and confidence. He must have had a beard because even through the white paste he also wore, he could see the bloodied cuts from shaving, some of which had reopened and bled down his face from the laughter.[NEWLINE]"Yes, I am still Perpentach." the old clown said.[NEWLINE]And this made him brutally angry. He was up on the dais like a bear protecting its den. He ripped the old clown off the bench and slammed him easily onto the ground.[NEWLINE]"Don't kill me!" the old Perpentach screamed. "I am you. I am Henri, and Pau and Vinner. You will be me in forty years."[NEWLINE]The new Perpentach stared down at the old. Had he really been that old and feeble? He thought he had been powerful, the Balseraph court catered to his every whim. But this saggy clown laying on the floor in front of him looked like an imposter in his clothes.[NEWLINE]He sat down the old man's chest. The old clown attempted to struggle but was too weak to do anything. He knocked his arms aside and squeezed his neck with his young, strong hands. He squeezed tighter as the old clowns face turned blue, squeezed tighter when the voices screamed for blood, squeezed tighter as he poured all of his self-loathing into his old battered body.[NEWLINE]Overall, it was a very cathartic experience. He regretted the fact others aren't able to kill themselves (at this thought they all laughed at poor suicidal Arn). It cleanses the palette, opening the mind to new opportunities and casts off former guilt and doubt. He reminded himself to suggest it to others who looked sad.[NEWLINE]And he still had his Blood God wine to look forward to. He poured it, sat in his garish bench throne and propped his feet up on the corpse that lay in front of it and wondered what this life would bring.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Perpentach escapes death by transferring his mind into a younger host every few decades. He then kills the old body. But one of those bodies survived and dragged itself out of the pit of corpses it was dropped into.[NEWLINE]That surviving version of Perpentach wears a mask and has adopted the persona of the Red Jester. He is unwilling to go through the process to transfer his mind again, and terrified that Perpentach will discover him and come back to finish the job.[NEWLINE]His insanity and sadism leads him to running one of the most hidden (and sought after) underground performances in Jubilee, the Carnival of Knives. Although relatively small, with just a few acts, the artistry and cruelty are unsurpassed. The Red Jester uses mind control to force his performers (most of which are dead by the end) through shocking and beautiful displays. Such as the man who consumes himself, the failed escape, and the transforming man (who cuts himself into a bird type creature). Between performances the Red Jester prowls the back alleys of Jubilee to find and dominate new performers to replace those he lost.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Perpentach shuddered on the floor. He pinched his eyes shut and covered his ears in an attempt to drown out the outside world. What was going on in his mind was enough. The memories of a hundred lifetimes were pouring into him. Every memory was being recalled while the lens through which he viewed them was being reforged. He was inside a kaleidoscope of endless, tumbling, crashing scenes of joy and tragedy.[NEWLINE]He was Samual, an acrobat with a love of rum. Under its heady guidance he was calm and sure, dancing on wires or the backs of galloping horses with ease. But without it the world scraped against him like biting sand. In Samual's mind the world was fixed and distant, like a land across an ocean, things happened there but it was generally unchanged while he was consumed with the discomforts of his own life.[NEWLINE]That was a dozen lifetimes ago, another rebirth of Perpentach, another who had gone through this process and awoken as the Momus king. But Samual's thoughts and memories were included with all the others, and he still screamed for a drink.[NEWLINE]He was one of hundreds. One was Pau, a mute artist that had never spoken until the rebirth had unlocked his tongue. Osso, A murderer who began by avenging those who were abused, and when he ran out of victims became less picky about those he killed. Keter, a hateful underling who almost managed to assassinate Perpentach, until the Momus transferred into him before he died. Arn, a young boy prone to depression and thoughts of suicide. Vinner, A personable Foxman who always hated that the Momus rarely traveled.[NEWLINE]It was as the murderous Osso that he judged the weakness of fawning Keter, always taking abuse from Perpentach, crying in secret, comforting himself for years with imagined revenge while doing nothing about it.

They had an affair which Kylorin found out about and caused him to accept a pact with Ceridwen for magical power in exchange for dedicating Patria to her.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kylorin's first act as a new archmage was to punish Eridanus. Kylorin fashioned a golem, enchanted it with powerful runes and filled it with thousands of four-inch-long demonic locusts. As powerful as the golem was, his stinging cloud of demons is more terrible. Kylorin then ripped the soul out of Eridanus and used it to animate the Golem, making sure that he is always able to feel the infestation and the torment of the locusts inside him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The golem became known as "The Hive", and Kylorin used him to kill his enemies. He especially enjoyed sending the Hive to kill the helpless (rioting mobs or captured civilians of enemy cities) because he knew Eridanus hated doing it. When Kylorin repented, he quit commanding the Hive, but the Hive still wanders Erebus, a horrific war machine with locusts that attack anyone nearby. And Eridanus is still trapped and tormented inside.</Spanish>

Yet in the way of dreaming, as Volanna's form receded, Ephyra willed herself to her and found herself exactly where she most deeply yearned to be, riding by Volanna's side on a snow leopard all her own. Ephyra's heart thrilled within her as Volanna met her eyes and favored her with a sly and knowing smile, slid low across her panther's back, and whispered right beside its ear, her dark hair almost merging with the panther's night-black fur. She seemed almost a part of its rushing, leaping motion, like a shadow passing swift across the snow. Leaning low instinctively, Ephyra felt her leopard's muscles bunching beneath her too, and then they were off at a leap through the snow, alone together with Volanna and her huge, sleek, beautiful panther, with the snow rushing past and the wind cold and sweet in her lungs and her unbound hair.[NEWLINE]"Where did you come from?" Ephyra snuggled against her snow leopard's head, and in the nature of a dream, it was just a little cub, as yet too small to ride, curled up with her in a dry, sunlit cave, its little furry body soft and warm against her skin.[NEWLINE]"Long ago," the leopard cub answered, "and far away." Its voice was soft and kindly, less like a leopard's growl or roar than like a kitten purring with the pleasure of Ephyra's company. "I am a gift," it whispered, close by her ear, within her mind, within her dream. "A gift from the heart of your deepest faith, to you."[NEWLINE]Ephyra hugged it tight, feeling of its soft fur, but doubt crept into her mind. "I'm too young to be a Nyxkin yet," she whispered in her dream. "The heart of our faith is deception. This..." She looked the leopard cub in the eyes, and felt her heart breaking within her. "Don't let this be a trick."[NEWLINE]Softly, the leopard licked her face, then snuggled its cheek against hers. "You have been chosen," it whispered in her ear, "and your heart has made its choice. The bond already has begun to form. And though we may work to deceive all of the world besides, there can be no deception now between you and me."[NEWLINE]Cuddling the leopard softly, wishing its words could be true, Ephyra whispered, "How can I know it's true though? Why shouldn't a deception claim that it can't deceive? Why would the heart of deception create a gift that's so bound up with honesty?"[NEWLINE]Again her little leopard cub gently licked her face. Again it cuddled just a little closer to her, warmer. It met her eyes and whispered only, "Try. The bond is real; explore it, and you'll see." And then within its feline eyes, the small snow leopard gave itself to her anew.[NEWLINE]She breathed in, soft and slow, smelling the clean scents of its thick, warm fur, looking deep into its green-grey eyes, feeling of the wish still glowing warm and sure within her heart, and hugged her dear snow leopard close, and gave herself to it entirely. She poured herself into the bond that was forming between them ... and looked out into her own beautiful, violet elven eyes, felt the loving embrace of her elven limbs, her fingers running softly through her warm, thick fur. She felt the snow leopard's love for her, its pleasure and devotion, as though they were her own emotions, and knew its thoughts the way she knew her own. "You are beautiful," it thought, in deep contentment, and by its thoughts she knew it meant not just her person but her thoughts and her emotions and the spirit of her life itself. An instant later, she felt its beautiful, contented pleasure as it came to know that her feelings for it were exactly the same.[NEWLINE]She giggled with love and exhilaration, and her leopard thought in their shared mind, "You see how deep a bond we share, though it is just beginning? This is our life together, the life that we will share until we meet our end as one." Then as Ephyra's final question bubbled up inside her mind, the leopard's answer, unspoken, formed within its secret thoughts, so none could know unless they shared the bond. "Yes, our faith is built on deception; it is practiced and taught and honed throughout Svartalfar society: Dishonesty and trickery and treachery and lies to protect every interest and desire, every secret of our lives - and at is heart, we all know, and many know who ever have met us or heard the legends that strangers tell of our society, is nothing more than deception for its own sake; deception of everyone and everything." And there was a bubbling feeling of laughter in the snow leopard's mind.[NEWLINE]"Except it isn't true," Ephyra realized in silence, secretly laughing with her leopard, delighting in the knowledge as it came. "It can't be true, because if it were, not only would there be no Nyxkin, there'd be no faith at all! If deception alone were truly the heart of our faith, it would never come out in our teachings, never mind the legends handed down among strangers. We'd think the faith is wrapped around something else entirely! So the whole idea of deception at the heart has to be another veil: A lie to hide a secret so deep, so dangerous and important, that my whole people and your whole race have to be raised and trained in the deepest arts of deception and secrecy just to guard whichever little pieces of it we're helping to carry out!"[NEWLINE]Ephyra spent a moment just enjoying the pleasure of discovery, letting her snow leopard share the feeling as she shared in its agreement, but then she asked within her thoughts, "What secret though? What secret could be so deep?"[NEWLINE]And then as neither had an answer, and as their thoughts led them both together the same way, they were off again in the way of dreams, a girl nearly grown riding bare-back on a great snow leopard, no longer a cub, charging through the wind and snow. Ephyra was herself again, little more than an elven child, but still she could feel her leopard's thoughts, its emotions, its consciousness, beautiful and hungry and wild, thrilling to the pleasure of running and the embrace of its beautiful rider - and when she chose, she could slip deeper into the bond, and feel feline muscles working, swift and sure and powerful, as though they were her own, and know her leopard's pleasure from the inside as it could know the pleasure of riding, of embracing a sleek, soft hunting cat racing eagerly through the snow, and feel the wind whipping through the long, black cascades of her elven hair, unbound.[NEWLINE]They came in the way of dreaming to ride beside Volanna through a stand of wind-stripped trees: A deciduous forest awaiting the spring that never came. They wended their way together between the barren trunks, beneath their empty branches, in a kind of riding dance whose pleasure Ephyra felt in all her limbs. So there among the monuments of the forest's ancient, dormant life, seeing the welcome in Volanna's eyes, Ephyra drew close, and when their knees were nearly touching, she leaned in closer still, to whisper her question for Volanna's ears alone: "What is the secret?"[NEWLINE]Softly, silently, smiling, Volanna placed her finger across Ephyra's lips, then reached up to run her fingers through the girl's windswept hair. "There are many, many secrets that a wise commander keeps, and some that I will never speak aloud. Yet you may know the answer to the question in your heart when time and rites and training hone your thoughts. When you are of the Nyxkin, chosen child as you are, then there are secrets that we both may share, and those that can't be spoken still may reach you once your thoughts can see and hide them better than the grave."[NEWLINE]They came to a stop together, deep within the forest that had been, but Ephyra's eyes, deeply grateful, deeply yearning, wouldn't leave her commander's, and even as they dismounted from their feline steeds, facing each other across them in the snow, Ephyra whispered, "Must I wait long?"[NEWLINE]With the small and knowing smile that Ephyra knew so well, Volanna slowly shook her head and answered, "I think it were far better if you did not wait all; for more than time, it needs you to prepare."[NEWLINE]Silently, within her, merging with her leopard's thoughts, Ephyra felt a thrill of pride and pleasure to fill her being. "Then I'll begin," she promised, and felt her heart and her leopard's lift together with the words. "I'll begin, and I'll be ready."[NEWLINE]The wind rustled tiny, bright-green shoots of leaves among the branches of a lone and regal beech, tall upon a craggy little hillock, well apart from all the other trees, and Volanna, framed against it, her hair at play in the same chill breeze, smiled at her young companion approvingly. Ephyra took the pleasure of that smile with her even as she fell away - not toward the ground but inward or outward, away from everything - and as she yearned to stop, to return somehow to Volanna's side, Ephyra woke instead to the darkness behind her eyelids, the warmth of her mother's arms around her, and the heart-breaking knowledge that all had been a dream.[NEWLINE]Perhaps her mother understood her heartache, though she could not know what had passed, could not know how Ephyra's mind bent back again and again with loss and longing on everything within the dream, for as they prepared in silence - almost in silence - for the day's long journey, though her mother didn't move her lips, Ephyra could hear her offering wordless comfort, very softly, just for her, like secret music, half humming, half a whisper, or an elven mother's imitation of a mother cat's loving purr. The sound sustained Ephyra as she put the pieces of her dream together once again, as she pushed away the dread that she had only deceived herself with her yearning. Though none of it had happened, some of it could be true: Though no new Nyxkin had arisen in her lifetime nor for a long time before, still she might someday become one, and if she did, Volanna surely would be glad. Even the deep secret she could not guess but that might lie at the very heart of her people's faith could still be real; the reasoning she had followed seemed no less true in waking, no matter though it first arose within a dream. Ephyra was young, and the morning sun was warm and bright, as it had been for days and days, and as it never quite had been in all her memory; it didn't seem so terrible to dream of a future she still deeply wished might be.[NEWLINE]They walked in silence - almost silence, for Ephyra stayed close by her mother's side, letting her wordless whispers, deeply comforting, fill her heart - until in their morning's journey they began to pass a stand of wind-stripped trees that Ephyra felt sure she had seen somewhere before. Slowly then, almost insensibly, she strayed toward them, strayed among them, knowing her mother still was close by the whisper that still was with her, like a gentle, loving purr. She didn't realize she was wrong - that she had left her mother and the others all behind - until she came to a craggy little hillock, some of its steepest rock faces clear of snow, upon which stood a lone and regal beech, well apart from all the other trees. Among its branches, gleaming in the morning light, were many tiny bright-green shoots of leaves. Ephyra stared, and her heart exulted though she knew that in one sense she was lost, for she knew as surely that this was not a dream. And when she reached with her heart and with her thoughts for the source of the sweet, comforting whisper, almost but not quite like a purr, that reached her from afar but reached no other living being in the world, she felt it there, a long way off, still just a little cub, its feline spirit beautiful and hungry and wild.[NEWLINE]A hawk's cry told Ephyra that either someone had come to seek her or a red-tail in the wind-stripped woods was seeking its kin nearby. Ephyra answered with a subtly different raptor's cry, reporting all was well, and even with her own voice loud in her lungs and in her ears, the sound could not drown out the beautiful whisper within - for it was not a sound, not truly a whisper, but a deep connection reaching her from afar. Soon she knew by the sounds of footsteps, deliberately made so as not to take her by surprise, that the bird cry had indeed been made by one of her people - but in that place, she could feel no shame even for straying so far away. The footsteps stopped beside her, and a hand came to rest on her shoulder, its gentle touch concealing the deep strength and martial prowess at its command. Ephyra knew that touch, and her whole heart swelled with pleasure and with pride. "It's true," she whispered, her voice nearly breaking with the sheer force of her joy. "The dream was true."[NEWLINE]Softly, without censure, seeming even perhaps to share in her pleasure and pride, Volanna answered her, "There are many ways of dreaming, young Ephyra, winter-born. Yet come in dreaming hours what may be, 'twere better in your waking to remain among your kin; to lose you would be dire for us indeed. So come, my little Nyxkin; ride a little while with me, and walk among our people once again. Your dreams are for yourself, and for one other whom you know, so let your secrets warm you both within."[NEWLINE]Even then, with Volanna's words like music in her ears, her heart and her distant leopard's fairly singing, Ephyra had not yet reached the apex of emotion on that first glorious day of her Nyxkin bond's beginning. In all her later years, she would cherish the memory of being lifted onto the back of Volanna's huge war panther, of riding together, leaning low so that she and the panther shared Volanna's powerful embrace and her own hands felt of the panther's night-black fur, of being set down again among her kin with a parting smile from Volanna and a lingering of her hand to show without words for all who looked upon them that Ephyra had her approval. Yet even before all this, as the great war panther moved up beside her, casting her eyes upon the early-blooming beech, Volanna spoke of just one of Ephyra's beautiful new secrets, singing a pleasure into her heart that had been building, waiting, not within her alone, but in everyone she had ever known through a long winter age: "This one shall be no secret in a very little time, for it shall be proclaimed by every tree. The snows are melting slowly, and the new growth has begun, and we have lived to see another spring."</English>

		<German>A whisper from somewhere, beautiful, compelling: "Arise now, for the time is come for you to ride with me."[NEWLINE]Ephyra, still a child by her people's reckoning but growing swiftly, was curled into a little ball, snuggled up within the circle of her mother's arms, warming each other against the cold of night, but Ephyra's consciousness was deep within another world, where her whole heart, her whole being rose to answer a whisper from Volanna herself.[NEWLINE]Child that she was, Ephyra had no steed; even among grown Svartalfar, few were chosen to be Nyxkin, and even those who were chosen required years of secret rites and training before they could ride. Yet in the way of dreaming, as Volanna's form receded, Ephyra willed herself to her and found herself exactly where she most deeply yearned to be, riding by Volanna's side on a snow leopard all her own. Ephyra's heart thrilled within her as Volanna met her eyes and favored her with a sly and knowing smile, slid low across her panther's back, and whispered right beside its ear, her dark hair almost merging with the panther's night-black fur. She seemed almost a part of its rushing, leaping motion, like a shadow passing swift across the snow. Leaning low instinctively, Ephyra felt her leopard's muscles bunching beneath her too, and then they were off at a leap through the snow, alone together with Volanna and her huge, sleek, beautiful panther, with the snow rushing past and the wind cold and sweet in her lungs and her unbound hair.[NEWLINE]"Where did you come from?" Ephyra snuggled against her snow leopard's head, and in the nature of a dream, it was just a little cub, as yet too small to ride, curled up with her in a dry, sunlit cave, its little furry body soft and warm against her skin.[NEWLINE]"Long ago," the leopard cub answered, "and far away." Its voice was soft and kindly, less like a leopard's growl or roar than like a kitten purring with the pleasure of Ephyra's company. "I am a gift," it whispered, close by her ear, within her mind, within her dream. "A gift from the heart of your deepest faith, to you."[NEWLINE]Ephyra hugged it tight, feeling of its soft fur, but doubt crept into her mind. "I'm too young to be a Nyxkin yet," she whispered in her dream. "The heart of our faith is deception. This..." She looked the leopard cub in the eyes, and felt her heart breaking within her. "Don't let this be a trick."[NEWLINE]Softly, the leopard licked her face, then snuggled its cheek against hers. "You have been chosen," it whispered in her ear, "and your heart has made its choice. The bond already has begun to form. And though we may work to deceive all of the world besides, there can be no deception now between you and me."[NEWLINE]Cuddling the leopard softly, wishing its words could be true, Ephyra whispered, "How can I know it's true though? Why shouldn't a deception claim that it can't deceive? Why would the heart of deception create a gift that's so bound up with honesty?"[NEWLINE]Again her little leopard cub gently licked her face. Again it cuddled just a little closer to her, warmer. It met her eyes and whispered only, "Try. The bond is real; explore it, and you'll see." And then within its feline eyes, the small snow leopard gave itself to her anew.[NEWLINE]She breathed in, soft and slow, smelling the clean scents of its thick, warm fur, looking deep into its green-grey eyes, feeling of the wish still glowing warm and sure within her heart, and hugged her dear snow leopard close, and gave herself to it entirely. She poured herself into the bond that was forming between them ... and looked out into her own beautiful, violet elven eyes, felt the loving embrace of her elven limbs, her fingers running softly through her warm, thick fur. She felt the snow leopard's love for her, its pleasure and devotion, as though they were her own emotions, and knew its thoughts the way she knew her own. "You are beautiful," it thought, in deep contentment, and by its thoughts she knew it meant not just her person but her thoughts and her emotions and the spirit of her life itself. An instant later, she felt its beautiful, contented pleasure as it came to know that her feelings for it were exactly the same.[NEWLINE]She giggled with love and exhilaration, and her leopard thought in their shared mind, "You see how deep a bond we share, though it is just beginning? This is our life together, the life that we will share until we meet our end as one." Then as Ephyra's final question bubbled up inside her mind, the leopard's answer, unspoken, formed within its secret thoughts, so none could know unless they shared the bond. "Yes, our faith is built on deception; it is practiced and taught and honed throughout Svartalfar society: Dishonesty and trickery and treachery and lies to protect every interest and desire, every secret of our lives - and at is heart, we all know, and many know who ever have met us or heard the legends that strangers tell of our society, is nothing more than deception for its own sake; deception of everyone and everything." And there was a bubbling feeling of laughter in the snow leopard's mind.[NEWLINE]"Except it isn't true," Ephyra realized in silence, secretly laughing with her leopard, delighting in the knowledge as it came. "It can't be true, because if it were, not only would there be no Nyxkin, there'd be no faith at all! If deception alone were truly the heart of our faith, it would never come out in our teachings, never mind the legends handed down among strangers. We'd think the faith is wrapped around something else entirely! So the whole idea of deception at the heart has to be another veil: A lie to hide a secret so deep, so dangerous and important, that my whole people and your whole race have to be raised and trained in the deepest arts of deception and secrecy just to guard whichever little pieces of it we're helping to carry out!"[NEWLINE]Ephyra spent a moment just enjoying the pleasure of discovery, letting her snow leopard share the feeling as she shared in its agreement, but then she asked within her thoughts, "What secret though? What secret could be so deep?"[NEWLINE]And then as neither had an answer, and as their thoughts led them both together the same way, they were off again in the way of dreams, a girl nearly grown riding bare-back on a great snow leopard, no longer a cub, charging through the wind and snow. Ephyra was herself again, little more than an elven child, but still she could feel her leopard's thoughts, its emotions, its consciousness, beautiful and hungry and wild, thrilling to the pleasure of running and the embrace of its beautiful rider - and when she chose, she could slip deeper into the bond, and feel feline muscles working, swift and sure and powerful, as though they were her own, and know her leopard's pleasure from the inside as it could know the pleasure of riding, of embracing a sleek, soft hunting cat racing eagerly through the snow, and feel the wind whipping through the long, black cascades of her elven hair, unbound.[NEWLINE]They came in the way of dreaming to ride beside Volanna through a stand of wind-stripped trees: A deciduous forest awaiting the spring that never came. They wended their way together between the barren trunks, beneath their empty branches, in a kind of riding dance whose pleasure Ephyra felt in all her limbs. So there among the monuments of the forest's ancient, dormant life, seeing the welcome in Volanna's eyes, Ephyra drew close, and when their knees were nearly touching, she leaned in closer still, to whisper her question for Volanna's ears alone: "What is the secret?"[NEWLINE]Softly, silently, smiling, Volanna placed her finger across Ephyra's lips, then reached up to run her fingers through the girl's windswept hair. "There are many, many secrets that a wise commander keeps, and some that I will never speak aloud. Yet you may know the answer to the question in your heart when time and rites and training hone your thoughts. When you are of the Nyxkin, chosen child as you are, then there are secrets that we both may share, and those that can't be spoken still may reach you once your thoughts can see and hide them better than the grave."[NEWLINE]They came to a stop together, deep within the forest that had been, but Ephyra's eyes, deeply grateful, deeply yearning, wouldn't leave her commander's, and even as they dismounted from their feline steeds, facing each other across them in the snow, Ephyra whispered, "Must I wait long?"[NEWLINE]With the small and knowing smile that Ephyra knew so well, Volanna slowly shook her head and answered, "I think it were far better if you did not wait all; for more than time, it needs you to prepare."[NEWLINE]Silently, within her, merging with her leopard's thoughts, Ephyra felt a thrill of pride and pleasure to fill her being. "Then I'll begin," she promised, and felt her heart and her leopard's lift together with the words. "I'll begin, and I'll be ready."[NEWLINE]The wind rustled tiny, bright-green shoots of leaves among the branches of a lone and regal beech, tall upon a craggy little hillock, well apart from all the other trees, and Volanna, framed against it, her hair at play in the same chill breeze, smiled at her young companion approvingly. Ephyra took the pleasure of that smile with her even as she fell away - not toward the ground but inward or outward, away from everything - and as she yearned to stop, to return somehow to Volanna's side, Ephyra woke instead to the darkness behind her eyelids, the warmth of her mother's arms around her, and the heart-breaking knowledge that all had been a dream.[NEWLINE]Perhaps her mother understood her heartache, though she could not know what had passed, could not know how Ephyra's mind bent back again and again with loss and longing on everything within the dream, for as they prepared in silence - almost in silence - for the day's long journey, though her mother didn't move her lips, Ephyra could hear her offering wordless comfort, very softly, just for her, like secret music, half humming, half a whisper, or an elven mother's imitation of a mother cat's loving purr. The sound sustained Ephyra as she put the pieces of her dream together once again, as she pushed away the dread that she had only deceived herself with her yearning. Though none of it had happened, some of it could be true: Though no new Nyxkin had arisen in her lifetime nor for a long time before, still she might someday become one, and if she did, Volanna surely would be glad. Even the deep secret she could not guess but that might lie at the very heart of her people's faith could still be real; the reasoning she had followed seemed no less true in waking, no matter though it first arose within a dream. Ephyra was young, and the morning sun was warm and bright, as it had been for days and days, and as it never quite had been in all her memory; it didn't seem so terrible to dream of a future she still deeply wished might be.[NEWLINE]They walked in silence - almost silence, for Ephyra stayed close by her mother's side, letting her wordless whispers, deeply comforting, fill her heart - until in their morning's journey they began to pass a stand of wind-stripped trees that Ephyra felt sure she had seen somewhere before. Slowly then, almost insensibly, she strayed toward them, strayed among them, knowing her mother still was close by the whisper that still was with her, like a gentle, loving purr. She didn't realize she was wrong - that she had left her mother and the others all behind - until she came to a craggy little hillock, some of its steepest rock faces clear of snow, upon which stood a lone and regal beech, well apart from all the other trees. Among its branches, gleaming in the morning light, were many tiny bright-green shoots of leaves. Ephyra stared, and her heart exulted though she knew that in one sense she was lost, for she knew as surely that this was not a dream. And when she reached with her heart and with her thoughts for the source of the sweet, comforting whisper, almost but not quite like a purr, that reached her from afar but reached no other living being in the world, she felt it there, a long way off, still just a little cub, its feline spirit beautiful and hungry and wild.[NEWLINE]A hawk's cry told Ephyra that either someone had come to seek her or a red-tail in the wind-stripped woods was seeking its kin nearby. Ephyra answered with a subtly different raptor's cry, reporting all was well, and even with her own voice loud in her lungs and in her ears, the sound could not drown out the beautiful whisper within - for it was not a sound, not truly a whisper, but a deep connection reaching her from afar. Soon she knew by the sounds of footsteps, deliberately made so as not to take her by surprise, that the bird cry had indeed been made by one of her people - but in that place, she could feel no shame even for straying so far away. The footsteps stopped beside her, and a hand came to rest on her shoulder, its gentle touch concealing the deep strength and martial prowess at its command. Ephyra knew that touch, and her whole heart swelled with pleasure and with pride. "It's true," she whispered, her voice nearly breaking with the sheer force of her joy. "The dream was true."[NEWLINE]Softly, without censure, seeming even perhaps to share in her pleasure and pride, Volanna answered her, "There are many ways of dreaming, young Ephyra, winter-born. Yet come in dreaming hours what may be, 'twere better in your waking to remain among your kin; to lose you would be dire for us indeed. So come, my little Nyxkin; ride a little while with me, and walk among our people once again. Your dreams are for yourself, and for one other whom you know, so let your secrets warm you both within."[NEWLINE]Even then, with Volanna's words like music in her ears, her heart and her distant leopard's fairly singing, Ephyra had not yet reached the apex of emotion on that first glorious day of her Nyxkin bond's beginning. In all her later years, she would cherish the memory of being lifted onto the back of Volanna's huge war panther, of riding together, leaning low so that she and the panther shared Volanna's powerful embrace and her own hands felt of the panther's night-black fur, of being set down again among her kin with a parting smile from Volanna and a lingering of her hand to show without words for all who looked upon them that Ephyra had her approval. Yet even before all this, as the great war panther moved up beside her, casting her eyes upon the early-blooming beech, Volanna spoke of just one of Ephyra's beautiful new secrets, singing a pleasure into her heart that had been building, waiting, not within her alone, but in everyone she had ever known through a long winter age: "This one shall be no secret in a very little time, for it shall be proclaimed by every tree. The snows are melting slowly, and the new growth has begun, and we have lived to see another spring."</German>
		<Italian>A whisper from somewhere, beautiful, compelling: "Arise now, for the time is come for you to ride with me."[NEWLINE]Ephyra, still a child by her people's reckoning but growing swiftly, was curled into a little ball, snuggled up within the circle of her mother's arms, warming each other against the cold of night, but Ephyra's consciousness was deep within another world, where her whole heart, her whole being rose to answer a whisper from Volanna herself.[NEWLINE]Child that she was, Ephyra had no steed; even among grown Svartalfar, few were chosen to be Nyxkin, and even those who were chosen required years of secret rites and training before they could ride. Yet in the way of dreaming, as Volanna's form receded, Ephyra willed herself to her and found herself exactly where she most deeply yearned to be, riding by Volanna's side on a snow leopard all her own. Ephyra's heart thrilled within her as Volanna met her eyes and favored her with a sly and knowing smile, slid low across her panther's back, and whispered right beside its ear, her dark hair almost merging with the panther's night-black fur. She seemed almost a part of its rushing, leaping motion, like a shadow passing swift across the snow. Leaning low instinctively, Ephyra felt her leopard's muscles bunching beneath her too, and then they were off at a leap through the snow, alone together with Volanna and her huge, sleek, beautiful panther, with the snow rushing past and the wind cold and sweet in her lungs and her unbound hair.[NEWLINE]"Where did you come from?" Ephyra snuggled against her snow leopard's head, and in the nature of a dream, it was just a little cub, as yet too small to ride, curled up with her in a dry, sunlit cave, its little furry body soft and warm against her skin.[NEWLINE]"Long ago," the leopard cub answered, "and far away." Its voice was soft and kindly, less like a leopard's growl or roar than like a kitten purring with the pleasure of Ephyra's company. "I am a gift," it whispered, close by her ear, within her mind, within her dream. "A gift from the heart of your deepest faith, to you."[NEWLINE]Ephyra hugged it tight, feeling of its soft fur, but doubt crept into her mind. "I'm too young to be a Nyxkin yet," she whispered in her dream. "The heart of our faith is deception. This..." She looked the leopard cub in the eyes, and felt her heart breaking within her. "Don't let this be a trick."[NEWLINE]Softly, the leopard licked her face, then snuggled its cheek against hers. "You have been chosen," it whispered in her ear, "and your heart has made its choice. The bond already has begun to form. And though we may work to deceive all of the world besides, there can be no deception now between you and me."[NEWLINE]Cuddling the leopard softly, wishing its words could be true, Ephyra whispered, "How can I know it's true though? Why shouldn't a deception claim that it can't deceive? Why would the heart of deception create a gift that's so bound up with honesty?"[NEWLINE]Again her little leopard cub gently licked her face. Again it cuddled just a little closer to her, warmer. It met her eyes and whispered only, "Try. The bond is real; explore it, and you'll see." And then within its feline eyes, the small snow leopard gave itself to her anew.[NEWLINE]She breathed in, soft and slow, smelling the clean scents of its thick, warm fur, looking deep into its green-grey eyes, feeling of the wish still glowing warm and sure within her heart, and hugged her dear snow leopard close, and gave herself to it entirely. She poured herself into the bond that was forming between them ... and looked out into her own beautiful, violet elven eyes, felt the loving embrace of her elven limbs, her fingers running softly through her warm, thick fur. She felt the snow leopard's love for her, its pleasure and devotion, as though they were her own emotions, and knew its thoughts the way she knew her own. "You are beautiful," it thought, in deep contentment, and by its thoughts she knew it meant not just her person but her thoughts and her emotions and the spirit of her life itself.

When you are of the Nyxkin, chosen child as you are, then there are secrets that we both may share, and those that can't be spoken still may reach you once your thoughts can see and hide them better than the grave."[NEWLINE]They came to a stop together, deep within the forest that had been, but Ephyra's eyes, deeply grateful, deeply yearning, wouldn't leave her commander's, and even as they dismounted from their feline steeds, facing each other across them in the snow, Ephyra whispered, "Must I wait long?"[NEWLINE]With the small and knowing smile that Ephyra knew so well, Volanna slowly shook her head and answered, "I think it were far better if you did not wait all; for more than time, it needs you to prepare."[NEWLINE]Silently, within her, merging with her leopard's thoughts, Ephyra felt a thrill of pride and pleasure to fill her being. "Then I'll begin," she promised, and felt her heart and her leopard's lift together with the words. "I'll begin, and I'll be ready."[NEWLINE]The wind rustled tiny, bright-green shoots of leaves among the branches of a lone and regal beech, tall upon a craggy little hillock, well apart from all the other trees, and Volanna, framed against it, her hair at play in the same chill breeze, smiled at her young companion approvingly. Ephyra took the pleasure of that smile with her even as she fell away - not toward the ground but inward or outward, away from everything - and as she yearned to stop, to return somehow to Volanna's side, Ephyra woke instead to the darkness behind her eyelids, the warmth of her mother's arms around her, and the heart-breaking knowledge that all had been a dream.[NEWLINE]Perhaps her mother understood her heartache, though she could not know what had passed, could not know how Ephyra's mind bent back again and again with loss and longing on everything within the dream, for as they prepared in silence - almost in silence - for the day's long journey, though her mother didn't move her lips, Ephyra could hear her offering wordless comfort, very softly, just for her, like secret music, half humming, half a whisper, or an elven mother's imitation of a mother cat's loving purr. The sound sustained Ephyra as she put the pieces of her dream together once again, as she pushed away the dread that she had only deceived herself with her yearning. Though none of it had happened, some of it could be true: Though no new Nyxkin had arisen in her lifetime nor for a long time before, still she might someday become one, and if she did, Volanna surely would be glad. Even the deep secret she could not guess but that might lie at the very heart of her people's faith could still be real; the reasoning she had followed seemed no less true in waking, no matter though it first arose within a dream. Ephyra was young, and the morning sun was warm and bright, as it had been for days and days, and as it never quite had been in all her memory; it didn't seem so terrible to dream of a future she still deeply wished might be.[NEWLINE]They walked in silence - almost silence, for Ephyra stayed close by her mother's side, letting her wordless whispers, deeply comforting, fill her heart - until in their morning's journey they began to pass a stand of wind-stripped trees that Ephyra felt sure she had seen somewhere before. Slowly then, almost insensibly, she strayed toward them, strayed among them, knowing her mother still was close by the whisper that still was with her, like a gentle, loving purr. She didn't realize she was wrong - that she had left her mother and the others all behind - until she came to a craggy little hillock, some of its steepest rock faces clear of snow, upon which stood a lone and regal beech, well apart from all the other trees. Among its branches, gleaming in the morning light, were many tiny bright-green shoots of leaves. Ephyra stared, and her heart exulted though she knew that in one sense she was lost, for she knew as surely that this was not a dream. And when she reached with her heart and with her thoughts for the source of the sweet, comforting whisper, almost but not quite like a purr, that reached her from afar but reached no other living being in the world, she felt it there, a long way off, still just a little cub, its feline spirit beautiful and hungry and wild.[NEWLINE]A hawk's cry told Ephyra that either someone had come to seek her or a red-tail in the wind-stripped woods was seeking its kin nearby. Ephyra answered with a subtly different raptor's cry, reporting all was well, and even with her own voice loud in her lungs and in her ears, the sound could not drown out the beautiful whisper within - for it was not a sound, not truly a whisper, but a deep connection reaching her from afar. Soon she knew by the sounds of footsteps, deliberately made so as not to take her by surprise, that the bird cry had indeed been made by one of her people - but in that place, she could feel no shame even for straying so far away. The footsteps stopped beside her, and a hand came to rest on her shoulder, its gentle touch concealing the deep strength and martial prowess at its command. Ephyra knew that touch, and her whole heart swelled with pleasure and with pride. "It's true," she whispered, her voice nearly breaking with the sheer force of her joy. "The dream was true."[NEWLINE]Softly, without censure, seeming even perhaps to share in her pleasure and pride, Volanna answered her, "There are many ways of dreaming, young Ephyra, winter-born. Yet come in dreaming hours what may be, 'twere better in your waking to remain among your kin; to lose you would be dire for us indeed. So come, my little Nyxkin; ride a little while with me, and walk among our people once again. Your dreams are for yourself, and for one other whom you know, so let your secrets warm you both within."[NEWLINE]Even then, with Volanna's words like music in her ears, her heart and her distant leopard's fairly singing, Ephyra had not yet reached the apex of emotion on that first glorious day of her Nyxkin bond's beginning. In all her later years, she would cherish the memory of being lifted onto the back of Volanna's huge war panther, of riding together, leaning low so that she and the panther shared Volanna's powerful embrace and her own hands felt of the panther's night-black fur, of being set down again among her kin with a parting smile from Volanna and a lingering of her hand to show without words for all who looked upon them that Ephyra had her approval. Yet even before all this, as the great war panther moved up beside her, casting her eyes upon the early-blooming beech, Volanna spoke of just one of Ephyra's beautiful new secrets, singing a pleasure into her heart that had been building, waiting, not within her alone, but in everyone she had ever known through a long winter age: "This one shall be no secret in a very little time, for it shall be proclaimed by every tree. The snows are melting slowly, and the new growth has begun, and we have lived to see another spring."</Spanish>

They are also considered to be living siege weapons, doing severe damage to objects and structures, but especially those made of stone or earth.</Spanish>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_UNIT_PRIEST_OF_KILMORPH_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>Deep in an inner cloister, Lord Fodran Thras met the stony eyes of the temple's keeper. Slowly, carefully weighing each word, in the deep and powerful voice that befitted a lord of the Khazad, he said, "They have been of great service, Stonewarden. Nor have they done any deed that would cast shame upon their honored names. They ask but little of us. How in good faith can we turn them now away?"[NEWLINE]Quietly, hands folded piously before him, his eyes cast down to seek the wisdom of the great Mother below, Ninth Stonewarden Ondrak Khar replied, "Then think you that their dealings with us have been in good faith?"[NEWLINE]Lord Fodran stirred and shook his head, not in answer to the question. "Had they said truly whence they came, and who would eat of the food we brought, it would have done more harm than what they did. We might have seen in them a separate invasion, and divided our forces even as we refused their aid."[NEWLINE]The Stonewarden's eyes were on him, stern and questioning. "I ask if their dealings have been in good faith, and you answer that their deception has benefited us."[NEWLINE]With a slow, deep sigh, Lord Fodran rose and began to pace the little cloister. "Their dealings with us have been honest, and yes, they were made in good faith, for they have done all that they promised. Their identity they concealed from us, and perhaps they suppose it still concealed, though our suspicions have been many times confirmed. Our secret eyes in the mountains now have even seen their hunters practicing their craft upon the surface. Yet I say that their identity and their dealings are not the same, and their deception merely enabled the deal which they faithfully have kept."[NEWLINE]Lord Thras frowned beneath his beard, as though his words did not quite ring true even in his own ears, and the Stonewarden asked him, "Think you that is all that their deception has done?" His eyes found Lord Fodran's once again. "Yet you spoke of that already; at least they have not by their actions desecrated stolen names. Yet you say that they hunt in the wilds? Why, if they receive all that they need from beneath the earth?"[NEWLINE]With a slow shrug, Lord Fodran answered, "Hunt they do, and gather such herbs as still can be obtained. They are elves; perhaps they crave other meats to supplement the pork we share with them, and greener things to eat." He paused, swallowing his disgust at the notion of elven food, and giving Stonewaren Khar time to do the same. "They may have other reasons though," he added soberly. "They may be aware that their future is tenuous while it depends upon our generosity, whether because they fear that we will detect their ruse eventually, or because they suspect when we no longer need them, we may prove unfaithful."[NEWLINE]The Stonewarden raised one dark and shaggy brow. "Do you suppose we needed them at any time?"[NEWLINE]Lord Fodran had to look away. "For the Khazad? For the Underhome?" He shook his head. "You need not remind me that we need no help to survive and to remain strong." But even as he said it, he met Ondrak's eyes once more. "They still have been of great value; many live today who would have died without their aid. Tell those, or tell their families, that we did not need our friends when this deep winter led so many creatures of the world above to try their luck and strength and lives against our defenses."[NEWLINE]For a long moment, their eyes held, but at last, Stonewarden Ondrak bowed his head, and consulted as ever with She Who Dwells Beneath. "You would persuade me, then," he murmured, "that they perform their craft well, though their craft is the art of illusion; that they deal honestly with us though they do so under stolen names; that we must continue to give them the little that they ask in order to repay the debt of gratitude we have incurred."[NEWLINE]Nodding slowly, Lord Thras answered, "It is what I feel, and the reason I have come to consult with you."[NEWLINE]Once more, the Stonewarden nodded, and then there was a meditative silence as he bowed low over his clasped hands, facing the holy earth below. When he straightened at last, he had his answer. "You may be right that we would not have trusted them had they spoken only truth, and if so, we must learn to better know friend from foe: It is never wise to trust more deeply where you are deceived than where you are confronted with the truth. Yet let us not heap folly upon folly by letting their deception stand. There is no good faith in a stolen name, but a transgression may be forgiven when it has done no harm, or when recompense is made, if it is owned. This then I will proclaim: We must make the true nature of the aid we have received known to all who once believed the lie we were told; and if our willingness to bring them gifts arises from the value of their aid and not the love of the honored dead whose names they stole, then let us not perpetuate the lie on either side. Let them not think our gifts to them are meant for our honored dead, but give them the opportunity, when they know the deal will hold, to own and to admit the truth we know."[NEWLINE]Lord Fodran slowly ran one thick and heavy hand across the back of a cloister chair. "It is a test of their true friendship that you propose then," he said at length. "It seems a weighted test though: Who among us could emerge into their midst to deliver this message of ours without giving them cause to fear that we are come to repel them from our caves? I would not risk the conflict that might arise then from mere misunderstanding, nor risk the life of any of my men by making him my messenger."[NEWLINE]"I shall be the messenger myself, should our people approve this choice," the Ninth Stonewarden answered. "For am I not warden to this part of the Underhome? Coming alone and in holy orders, I can hardly fill their hearts with dread, and I shall try if I can to speak to them from within the tomb where we have left our gifts for them. My life I set at less value than the Way of the Earthmother and the course our people follow - we and any who would be our friends. For in my teachings I have shared the strength of the stone with each of you, and so you all shall be protected, whether I live or die, by the true shield of our faith."</English>

Yet I say that their identity and their dealings are not the same, and their deception merely enabled the deal which they faithfully have kept."[NEWLINE]Lord Thras frowned beneath his beard, as though his words did not quite ring true even in his own ears, and the Stonewarden asked him, "Think you that is all that their deception has done?" His eyes found Lord Fodran's once again. "Yet you spoke of that already; at least they have not by their actions desecrated stolen names. Yet you say that they hunt in the wilds? Why, if they receive all that they need from beneath the earth?"[NEWLINE]With a slow shrug, Lord Fodran answered, "Hunt they do, and gather such herbs as still can be obtained. They are elves; perhaps they crave other meats to supplement the pork we share with them, and greener things to eat." He paused, swallowing his disgust at the notion of elven food, and giving Stonewaren Khar time to do the same. "They may have other reasons though," he added soberly. "They may be aware that their future is tenuous while it depends upon our generosity, whether because they fear that we will detect their ruse eventually, or because they suspect when we no longer need them, we may prove unfaithful."[NEWLINE]The Stonewarden raised one dark and shaggy brow. "Do you suppose we needed them at any time?"[NEWLINE]Lord Fodran had to look away. "For the Khazad? For the Underhome?" He shook his head. "You need not remind me that we need no help to survive and to remain strong." But even as he said it, he met Ondrak's eyes once more. "They still have been of great value; many live today who would have died without their aid. Tell those, or tell their families, that we did not need our friends when this deep winter led so many creatures of the world above to try their luck and strength and lives against our defenses."[NEWLINE]For a long moment, their eyes held, but at last, Stonewarden Ondrak bowed his head, and consulted as ever with She Who Dwells Beneath. "You would persuade me, then," he murmured, "that they perform their craft well, though their craft is the art of illusion; that they deal honestly with us though they do so under stolen names; that we must continue to give them the little that they ask in order to repay the debt of gratitude we have incurred."[NEWLINE]Nodding slowly, Lord Thras answered, "It is what I feel, and the reason I have come to consult with you."[NEWLINE]Once more, the Stonewarden nodded, and then there was a meditative silence as he bowed low over his clasped hands, facing the holy earth below. When he straightened at last, he had his answer. "You may be right that we would not have trusted them had they spoken only truth, and if so, we must learn to better know friend from foe: It is never wise to trust more deeply where you are deceived than where you are confronted with the truth. Yet let us not heap folly upon folly by letting their deception stand. There is no good faith in a stolen name, but a transgression may be forgiven when it has done no harm, or when recompense is made, if it is owned. This then I will proclaim: We must make the true nature of the aid we have received known to all who once believed the lie we were told; and if our willingness to bring them gifts arises from the value of their aid and not the love of the honored dead whose names they stole, then let us not perpetuate the lie on either side. Let them not think our gifts to them are meant for our honored dead, but give them the opportunity, when they know the deal will hold, to own and to admit the truth we know."[NEWLINE]Lord Fodran slowly ran one thick and heavy hand across the back of a cloister chair. "It is a test of their true friendship that you propose then," he said at length. "It seems a weighted test though: Who among us could emerge into their midst to deliver this message of ours without giving them cause to fear that we are come to repel them from our caves? I would not risk the conflict that might arise then from mere misunderstanding, nor risk the life of any of my men by making him my messenger."[NEWLINE]"I shall be the messenger myself, should our people approve this choice," the Ninth Stonewarden answered. "For am I not warden to this part of the Underhome? Coming alone and in holy orders, I can hardly fill their hearts with dread, and I shall try if I can to speak to them from within the tomb where we have left our gifts for them. My life I set at less value than the Way of the Earthmother and the course our people follow - we and any who would be our friends. For in my teachings I have shared the strength of the stone with each of you, and so you all shall be protected, whether I live or die, by the true shield of our faith."</Italian>
		<Spanish>Deep in an inner cloister, Lord Fodran Thras met the stony eyes of the temple's keeper. Slowly, carefully weighing each word, in the deep and powerful voice that befitted a lord of the Khazad, he said, "They have been of great service, Stonewarden. Nor have they done any deed that would cast shame upon their honored names. They ask but little of us. How in good faith can we turn them now away?"[NEWLINE]Quietly, hands folded piously before him, his eyes cast down to seek the wisdom of the great Mother below, Ninth Stonewarden Ondrak Khar replied, "Then think you that their dealings with us have been in good faith?"[NEWLINE]Lord Fodran stirred and shook his head, not in answer to the question. "Had they said truly whence they came, and who would eat of the food we brought, it would have done more harm than what they did. We might have seen in them a separate invasion, and divided our forces even as we refused their aid."[NEWLINE]The Stonewarden's eyes were on him, stern and questioning. "I ask if their dealings have been in good faith, and you answer that their deception has benefited us."[NEWLINE]With a slow, deep sigh, Lord Fodran rose and began to pace the little cloister. "Their dealings with us have been honest, and yes, they were made in good faith, for they have done all that they promised. Their identity they concealed from us, and perhaps they suppose it still concealed, though our suspicions have been many times confirmed. Our secret eyes in the mountains now have even seen their hunters practicing their craft upon the surface. Yet I say that their identity and their dealings are not the same, and their deception merely enabled the deal which they faithfully have kept."[NEWLINE]Lord Thras frowned beneath his beard, as though his words did not quite ring true even in his own ears, and the Stonewarden asked him, "Think you that is all that their deception has done?"

		<English>Slowly, faintly, like a whisper from afar, Marelan became aware of his tiger's stirring. They had been through many trials together, a priest of the old rites of nature with a still-living gift of his ancient faith, and Marelan trusted his old companion, growling now, defensive, to handle any frostling or winter beast that dared approach. He knew too that there were sentries near, from the Ljosalfar encampment, but he did not think of them; the same discovery that led him to remain so far from camp held him also to his dance, slow, steady, absorbing, so that he moved almost unseeing, almost unaware, across the little patch of ground he had found: A patch still free of ice and killing frost, where by the power of his ancient rites, his dance and whispered prayers, tiny shoots might take root from living seeds and swiftly grow into saplings. Soon, a little forest, new to the world, might shelter the earth beneath it there, and even grow into an evergreen wood that could withstand the endless winter snows. So he danced and so he whispered and so he only barely knew of his tiger's sudden battle - and afterward, just vaguely, heard the tiger's growls in another pitch: A sound of contentment that promised all was well. The sentries too must have been nearer than he thought, for he heard the sound of elven footsteps nearby, far from his thoughts - but even without them, he would never have abandoned his rites of blooming unless death brought their end along with his own.[NEWLINE]The rites at last completed, Marelan opened his eyes ... and froze, for there before him, near at hand, his tiger lay upon its back, deeply hurt but deeply relaxed, its wounds carefully tended by a stranger: A tall, slender huntress with long, dark hair and ebon eyes. Unmistakably Svartalfar, with the marks of the Winter Court, the huntress tickled the tiger's belly in between carefully changing the bandages on wounds she herself had inflicted while Marelan danced, and his tiger - no longer his tiger - nuzzled its head contentedly against her, tame to her hand. There came another sound behind him, and he spun to see another of the treacherous Svartalfar - and a Nyxkin, among the most deadly of them all - slipping down from the back of her huge snow leopard, as agile and almost as feline in her own motions as her steed, directly between him and the Ljosalfar encampment. She knelt and examined one of the little seedlings still growing under the power of his ritual, reached out a finger to stroke its leaves ... and kept herself positioned, coiled like a leopard ready to spring, so that her eyes, focused on the seedling, still could watch Marelan's every movement on the periphery.[NEWLINE]He knew he had to draw them off; if they came to the encampment, they could strike at once together or warn their cohorts and plan an all-out siege. The Ljosalfar, though struggling, were making it through the endless winter with the help of their ancient faith, but he well knew, as Arendel Phaedra herself had so often proclaimed, that any battle between elves, no matter of what court, during this long and deadly winter must spell the death of all. So he slowly backed away - away from the Nyxkin, away from help and home, toward what he hoped would prove a wide gap between sentries after all - a gap the Svartalfar had exploited knowingly or unknowingly - so that if there must be fighting, and if there must be death, then it might come alone to him or his pursuers, and do no further harm to the Ljosalfar.[NEWLINE]The Nyxkin's eyes flashed to him as he began to back away, and the emotions that he saw there nearly pinned him to the earth. Her sheer strength, confidence, and battle prowess gleamed in those dark, dark eyes, but there was more: Curiosity to match a hunting cat's, and interest, and attention, and contentment like a leopard with its prey beneath its paw. And yet within it all, he could feel something deeper still - something bound up with the gentle way her fingers had caressed the seedling he had grown. Marelan could feel his own emotions roiling in response to that look in her dark, dark eyes, and a notion formed unbidden in the deep parts of his mind: Perhaps there might yet be no need of battle or of death if he could only lead them far enough away. Was not his tiger tame now to the hand of the deadly huntress? And might not he yet survive meeting this still-more-deadly Nyxkin if only he allowed himself to become tame to hers? Too well he knew the treachery of the Svartalfar, the people whose Court had turned from his beloved ancient rites to those that honored dark deception, but no matter how well he knew it, still in the deep, unthinking corners of his mind, he could feel temptation there.[NEWLINE]Slowly, he backed away from the Nyxkin, his eyes never leaving hers, and she watched in silence with the smallest of smiles beginning to crook just the corner of her lips. Her snow leopard padded to her side, and her fingers ran slowly through its fur, stroking it just behind the ears, but the way it nuzzled into the soft flow of her ebon hair was very unlike the new-tamed tiger's with its huntress, for the leopard gazed all the while upon Marelan with intelligent-seeming eyes, and crouched beside the Nyxkin like a partner in crime, neither surrendering to her nor asking her surrender because they worked as one. Marelan could feel the eyes of the huntress burning into him as well, could feel his tiger relaxed and unaware, content under the hand of the Svartalfar woman who could have slain it and had spared its life. Another step backward, always carefully avoiding the little seedlings he had planted, terribly vulnerable though swiftly growing still, and then the Nyxkin was on her leopard's back, the two of them moving together as if in a single flowing motion, uncoiling and pursuing, unhurriedly, at leisure, but still so swift and graceful...[NEWLINE]Marelan turned and ran. He saw the Nyxkin riding after him, in no hurry, on her leopard, and thought he saw her crooked smile grow, but then had no more time to look behind. Across his sacred little patch of ground, his little saplings grew, and he had to take care where he placed his feet, and beyond that there was snow and ice enough to take all his attention - or almost all. He had half-seen or half-remembered - or less than half perhaps, for there was a part of Marelan that deeply wanted to believe - the Nyxkin and her leopard steed in their leisurely pursuit, and even the huntress rising to follow, taking care with their steps, keeping all the seedlings safe, as surely and as carefully as he.[NEWLINE]He ran as hard and as long as he could, slipping on patches of exposed ice, stumbling through drifts of snow, tripping over the rocks and branches they sometimes concealed, sparing fewer and fewer glances behind him where the Nyxkin rode at an easy lope on a steed bred and born and raised to hunt in snow and ice and frigid cold. Sometimes she drew nearer, and he saw her over his left shoulder or his right, and he hurried faster, turning to put her at his back, but she never quite closed the distance though toward the end as his steps faltered, the leopard seemed to snap at his very heels, and he ran on, panting with exhaustion, no longer even noticing the cold. He wanted to believe he'd led them far enough away, that they would suppose him a lone exile and not part of a refugee band, but he knew that no distance could be great enough - as surely as he knew that the Nyxkin and her snow leopard were toying with him, playing like a hunting cat with its food - and more and more apparently, also herding him somewhere. He would have assumed it was a trap had he not known he was caught already - and known that she knew.[NEWLINE]Later, Marelan would hardly remember the final stretch, the little temporary settlement whose Svartalfar guards allowed his passage at a signal from the Nyxkin, the little shelter into which she herded him effortlessly. He didn't remember crossing the threshold, nor falling to his knees, nor crawling the last few steps, nor curling up to sleep. He would only remember waking, shaken from slumber by a stranger's hand, half surprised and deeply grateful to have slept, and to be alive.[NEWLINE]The warmth in the little shelter was a warmth of many people huddled together inside: Svartalfar men filing quietly out into the temporary settlement outside. The one who had wakened Marelan said, "Come; you mustn't miss breakfast," and when Marelan shared their meal with them - a meager feast of winter gruel provided by the same Nyxkin who had chased him - it seemed to him that nothing in his memory had ever tasted so delicious.[NEWLINE]The Svartalfar manservants already, without need of any command, were beginning to organize themselves into work teams. Their faces betrayed no emotion, but in their every action, Marelan could see their eagerness to show themselves able and willing, to prove themselves in service to their mistresses. In spite of himself, Marelan could feel a kind of kinship and even envy as he watched them. Like his tiger under the hand of the huntress who cared for it, these Svartalfar men had food and shelter, warmth and company, and soon an opportunity to do useful labor, and especially in the terrible, ever-deepening winter, this was more than many beings could hope for in the world. All they had to do in exchange was to leave the thinking, all the endless hard decisions, to beautiful, powerful Svartalfar women. It was easy to understand, to empathize with the choices of his tiger and of all the Svartalfar men; the allure of surrender spoke to Marelan's deepest instincts. He was more than a beast of instict though, and more than a Svartalfar male raised into a life of willing service. Marelan was a man of faith, and his faith was not compatible with theirs.[NEWLINE]The Nyxkin was watching him again, and he dared not meet her gaze; he needed to think, and wasn't ready to do battle with those dark, intriguing eyes. He had strength again, as he had not at the end of his taxing ritual of the day before, but he had seen the huntress nearby who had tamed his tiger to her hand; to call another would only provide her with another pet. For that matter, to fight them at all could only help to renew the civil war that they seemed prepared, at least in his case, at least for the space of a meal and a night's rest, to suspend. There was peace ... at least a moment's peace before the next betrayal. He was somehow welcomed into what he would not long before have called the enemy camp. He saw clearly at last that there was only one thing he could do.[NEWLINE]Letting go at last completely of all the needs and all the wishes of his body, letting go of his body itself, he prayed and called upon the power of his faith with all his last reserves of strength and life, and changed himself both in his shape and in his very nature, growing like a jungle shoot, but far more swiftly than any living plant in even the lushest of jungles had ever grown. Spires grew upon the spot where Marelan had stood, shaped from enormous, bright green leaves, and together formed a little temple - very small in that hard and icy land, but still by everything that Marelan had given to it, everything that he had been, complete. Invested with his life and his emotions, his kinship and empathy for them, his little temple of the ancient forest rites stood within the Svartalfar settlement, not as a challenge but as a gift.[NEWLINE]Feline footsteps, all but silent, crossed the threshold, and the dark-eyed Nyxkin who had chased and herded Marelan looked around. She slowly circled the interior with her hunting cat, just one corner of her lips touched with her little, dangerous smile. She slid from her snow leopard's back with the same easy feline grace he had admired against his will the day before, and she circled closer, touching the very altar, brushing it gently as she passed, and Marelan could feel her presence and her fingertips as if upon his living heart. Remade as a temple, bound to his ancient faith, he no longer was susceptible to her beauty, to the catlike grace of her movements, and yet somehow her presence still nearly burned him with hope and fear. She still represented danger, deep and deadly danger to the temple he had become and to the people whom he loved, never safe in their encampment, never far enough away. She still could somehow thrill him when her fingers touched the altar ... and then at last, he could see why: Her touch was soft, caressing, like her touch upon his new-born sapling leaves. In her dark eyes, amid her deadly power, her confidence and strength, her deep and feline curiosity, her interest, her attention, he sensed the thing that his whole being yearned to feel from her: Her approval, quiet, calm, but unmistakable, for his life and for his work, and maybe, maybe, if he dared even to hope it, for his faith.[NEWLINE]She met with her commander at the temple threshold, resting her hand upon the doorframe with gentle, almost proprietary care. Almost purring, she whispered, "Look what I brought home."[NEWLINE]The commander of the Nyxkin did not purr in reply. Her voice was stronger and more confident than even her officer's dark eyes ... and yet she too seemed to approve. "Well hunted, and well guided, and my gratitude to him; we may need all the knowledge and resources we can find if this cruel winter's deepening goes on. Let some shelter here who wish to learn the ancient rites he used, for he will share them, having shared his faith with us."</English>

There was peace ... at least a moment's peace before the next betrayal. He was somehow welcomed into what he would not long before have called the enemy camp. He saw clearly at last that there was only one thing he could do.[NEWLINE]Letting go at last completely of all the needs and all the wishes of his body, letting go of his body itself, he prayed and called upon the power of his faith with all his last reserves of strength and life, and changed himself both in his shape and in his very nature, growing like a jungle shoot, but far more swiftly than any living plant in even the lushest of jungles had ever grown. Spires grew upon the spot where Marelan had stood, shaped from enormous, bright green leaves, and together formed a little temple - very small in that hard and icy land, but still by everything that Marelan had given to it, everything that he had been, complete. Invested with his life and his emotions, his kinship and empathy for them, his little temple of the ancient forest rites stood within the Svartalfar settlement, not as a challenge but as a gift.[NEWLINE]Feline footsteps, all but silent, crossed the threshold, and the dark-eyed Nyxkin who had chased and herded Marelan looked around. She slowly circled the interior with her hunting cat, just one corner of her lips touched with her little, dangerous smile. She slid from her snow leopard's back with the same easy feline grace he had admired against his will the day before, and she circled closer, touching the very altar, brushing it gently as she passed, and Marelan could feel her presence and her fingertips as if upon his living heart. Remade as a temple, bound to his ancient faith, he no longer was susceptible to her beauty, to the catlike grace of her movements, and yet somehow her presence still nearly burned him with hope and fear. She still represented danger, deep and deadly danger to the temple he had become and to the people whom he loved, never safe in their encampment, never far enough away. She still could somehow thrill him when her fingers touched the altar ... and then at last, he could see why: Her touch was soft, caressing, like her touch upon his new-born sapling leaves. In her dark eyes, amid her deadly power, her confidence and strength, her deep and feline curiosity, her interest, her attention, he sensed the thing that his whole being yearned to feel from her: Her approval, quiet, calm, but unmistakable, for his life and for his work, and maybe, maybe, if he dared even to hope it, for his faith.[NEWLINE]She met with her commander at the temple threshold, resting her hand upon the doorframe with gentle, almost proprietary care. Almost purring, she whispered, "Look what I brought home."[NEWLINE]The commander of the Nyxkin did not purr in reply. Her voice was stronger and more confident than even her officer's dark eyes ... and yet she too seemed to approve. "Well hunted, and well guided, and my gratitude to him; we may need all the knowledge and resources we can find if this cruel winter's deepening goes on. Let some shelter here who wish to learn the ancient rites he used, for he will share them, having shared his faith with us."</French>
		<German>Slowly, faintly, like a whisper from afar, Marelan became aware of his tiger's stirring. They had been through many trials together, a priest of the old rites of nature with a still-living gift of his ancient faith, and Marelan trusted his old companion, growling now, defensive, to handle any frostling or winter beast that dared approach. He knew too that there were sentries near, from the Ljosalfar encampment, but he did not think of them; the same discovery that led him to remain so far from camp held him also to his dance, slow, steady, absorbing, so that he moved almost unseeing, almost unaware, across the little patch of ground he had found: A patch still free of ice and killing frost, where by the power of his ancient rites, his dance and whispered prayers, tiny shoots might take root from living seeds and swiftly grow into saplings. Soon, a little forest, new to the world, might shelter the earth beneath it there, and even grow into an evergreen wood that could withstand the endless winter snows. So he danced and so he whispered and so he only barely knew of his tiger's sudden battle - and afterward, just vaguely, heard the tiger's growls in another pitch: A sound of contentment that promised all was well. The sentries too must have been nearer than he thought, for he heard the sound of elven footsteps nearby, far from his thoughts - but even without them, he would never have abandoned his rites of blooming unless death brought their end along with his own.[NEWLINE]The rites at last completed, Marelan opened his eyes ... and froze, for there before him, near at hand, his tiger lay upon its back, deeply hurt but deeply relaxed, its wounds carefully tended by a stranger: A tall, slender huntress with long, dark hair and ebon eyes. Unmistakably Svartalfar, with the marks of the Winter Court, the huntress tickled the tiger's belly in between carefully changing the bandages on wounds she herself had inflicted while Marelan danced, and his tiger - no longer his tiger - nuzzled its head contentedly against her, tame to her hand. There came another sound behind him, and he spun to see another of the treacherous Svartalfar - and a Nyxkin, among the most deadly of them all - slipping down from the back of her huge snow leopard, as agile and almost as feline in her own motions as her steed, directly between him and the Ljosalfar encampment. She knelt and examined one of the little seedlings still growing under the power of his ritual, reached out a finger to stroke its leaves ... and kept herself positioned, coiled like a leopard ready to spring, so that her eyes, focused on the seedling, still could watch Marelan's every movement on the periphery.[NEWLINE]He knew he had to draw them off; if they came to the encampment, they could strike at once together or warn their cohorts and plan an all-out siege. The Ljosalfar, though struggling, were making it through the endless winter with the help of their ancient faith, but he well knew, as Arendel Phaedra herself had so often proclaimed, that any battle between elves, no matter of what court, during this long and deadly winter must spell the death of all. So he slowly backed away - away from the Nyxkin, away from help and home, toward what he hoped would prove a wide gap between sentries after all - a gap the Svartalfar had exploited knowingly or unknowingly - so that if there must be fighting, and if there must be death, then it might come alone to him or his pursuers, and do no further harm to the Ljosalfar.[NEWLINE]The Nyxkin's eyes flashed to him as he began to back away, and the emotions that he saw there nearly pinned him to the earth. Her sheer strength, confidence, and battle prowess gleamed in those dark, dark eyes, but there was more: Curiosity to match a hunting cat's, and interest, and attention, and contentment like a leopard with its prey beneath its paw. And yet within it all, he could feel something deeper still - something bound up with the gentle way her fingers had caressed the seedling he had grown. Marelan could feel his own emotions roiling in response to that look in her dark, dark eyes, and a notion formed unbidden in the deep parts of his mind: Perhaps there might yet be no need of battle or of death if he could only lead them far enough away. Was not his tiger tame now to the hand of the deadly huntress? And might not he yet survive meeting this still-more-deadly Nyxkin if only he allowed himself to become tame to hers? Too well he knew the treachery of the Svartalfar, the people whose Court had turned from his beloved ancient rites to those that honored dark deception, but no matter how well he knew it, still in the deep, unthinking corners of his mind, he could feel temptation there.[NEWLINE]Slowly, he backed away from the Nyxkin, his eyes never leaving hers, and she watched in silence with the smallest of smiles beginning to crook just the corner of her lips. Her snow leopard padded to her side, and her fingers ran slowly through its fur, stroking it just behind the ears, but the way it nuzzled into the soft flow of her ebon hair was very unlike the new-tamed tiger's with its huntress, for the leopard gazed all the while upon Marelan with intelligent-seeming eyes, and crouched beside the Nyxkin like a partner in crime, neither surrendering to her nor asking her surrender because they worked as one. Marelan could feel the eyes of the huntress burning into him as well, could feel his tiger relaxed and unaware, content under the hand of the Svartalfar woman who could have slain it and had spared its life. Another step backward, always carefully avoiding the little seedlings he had planted, terribly vulnerable though swiftly growing still, and then the Nyxkin was on her leopard's back, the two of them moving together as if in a single flowing motion, uncoiling and pursuing, unhurriedly, at leisure, but still so swift and graceful...[NEWLINE]Marelan turned and ran. He saw the Nyxkin riding after him, in no hurry, on her leopard, and thought he saw her crooked smile grow, but then had no more time to look behind. Across his sacred little patch of ground, his little saplings grew, and he had to take care where he placed his feet, and beyond that there was snow and ice enough to take all his attention - or almost all. He had half-seen or half-remembered - or less than half perhaps, for there was a part of Marelan that deeply wanted to believe - the Nyxkin and her leopard steed in their leisurely pursuit, and even the huntress rising to follow, taking care with their steps, keeping all the seedlings safe, as surely and as carefully as he.[NEWLINE]He ran as hard and as long as he could, slipping on patches of exposed ice, stumbling through drifts of snow, tripping over the rocks and branches they sometimes concealed, sparing fewer and fewer glances behind him where the Nyxkin rode at an easy lope on a steed bred and born and raised to hunt in snow and ice and frigid cold. Sometimes she drew nearer, and he saw her over his left shoulder or his right, and he hurried faster, turning to put her at his back, but she never quite closed the distance though toward the end as his steps faltered, the leopard seemed to snap at his very heels, and he ran on, panting with exhaustion, no longer even noticing the cold. He wanted to believe he'd led them far enough away, that they would suppose him a lone exile and not part of a refugee band, but he knew that no distance could be great enough - as surely as he knew that the Nyxkin and her snow leopard were toying with him, playing like a hunting cat with its food - and more and more apparently, also herding him somewhere. He would have assumed it was a trap had he not known he was caught already - and known that she knew.[NEWLINE]Later, Marelan would hardly remember the final stretch, the little temporary settlement whose Svartalfar guards allowed his passage at a signal from the Nyxkin, the little shelter into which she herded him effortlessly. He didn't remember crossing the threshold, nor falling to his knees, nor crawling the last few steps, nor curling up to sleep. He would only remember waking, shaken from slumber by a stranger's hand, half surprised and deeply grateful to have slept, and to be alive.[NEWLINE]The warmth in the little shelter was a warmth of many people huddled together inside: Svartalfar men filing quietly out into the temporary settlement outside. The one who had wakened Marelan said, "Come; you mustn't miss breakfast," and when Marelan shared their meal with them - a meager feast of winter gruel provided by the same Nyxkin who had chased him - it seemed to him that nothing in his memory had ever tasted so delicious.[NEWLINE]The Svartalfar manservants already, without need of any command, were beginning to organize themselves into work teams. Their faces betrayed no emotion, but in their every action, Marelan could see their eagerness to show themselves able and willing, to prove themselves in service to their mistresses. In spite of himself, Marelan could feel a kind of kinship and even envy as he watched them. Like his tiger under the hand of the huntress who cared for it, these Svartalfar men had food and shelter, warmth and company, and soon an opportunity to do useful labor, and especially in the terrible, ever-deepening winter, this was more than many beings could hope for in the world. All they had to do in exchange was to leave the thinking, all the endless hard decisions, to beautiful, powerful Svartalfar women. It was easy to understand, to empathize with the choices of his tiger and of all the Svartalfar men; the allure of surrender spoke to Marelan's deepest instincts. He was more than a beast of instict though, and more than a Svartalfar male raised into a life of willing service. Marelan was a man of faith, and his faith was not compatible with theirs.[NEWLINE]The Nyxkin was watching him again, and he dared not meet her gaze; he needed to think, and wasn't ready to do battle with those dark, intriguing eyes. He had strength again, as he had not at the end of his taxing ritual of the day before, but he had seen the huntress nearby who had tamed his tiger to her hand; to call another would only provide her with another pet. For that matter, to fight them at all could only help to renew the civil war that they seemed prepared, at least in his case, at least for the space of a meal and a night's rest, to suspend. There was peace ... at least a moment's peace before the next betrayal. He was somehow welcomed into what he would not long before have called the enemy camp. He saw clearly at last that there was only one thing he could do.[NEWLINE]Letting go at last completely of all the needs and all the wishes of his body, letting go of his body itself, he prayed and called upon the power of his faith with all his last reserves of strength and life, and changed himself both in his shape and in his very nature, growing like a jungle shoot, but far more swiftly than any living plant in even the lushest of jungles had ever grown.

Her snow leopard padded to her side, and her fingers ran slowly through its fur, stroking it just behind the ears, but the way it nuzzled into the soft flow of her ebon hair was very unlike the new-tamed tiger's with its huntress, for the leopard gazed all the while upon Marelan with intelligent-seeming eyes, and crouched beside the Nyxkin like a partner in crime, neither surrendering to her nor asking her surrender because they worked as one. Marelan could feel the eyes of the huntress burning into him as well, could feel his tiger relaxed and unaware, content under the hand of the Svartalfar woman who could have slain it and had spared its life. Another step backward, always carefully avoiding the little seedlings he had planted, terribly vulnerable though swiftly growing still, and then the Nyxkin was on her leopard's back, the two of them moving together as if in a single flowing motion, uncoiling and pursuing, unhurriedly, at leisure, but still so swift and graceful...[NEWLINE]Marelan turned and ran. He saw the Nyxkin riding after him, in no hurry, on her leopard, and thought he saw her crooked smile grow, but then had no more time to look behind. Across his sacred little patch of ground, his little saplings grew, and he had to take care where he placed his feet, and beyond that there was snow and ice enough to take all his attention - or almost all. He had half-seen or half-remembered - or less than half perhaps, for there was a part of Marelan that deeply wanted to believe - the Nyxkin and her leopard steed in their leisurely pursuit, and even the huntress rising to follow, taking care with their steps, keeping all the seedlings safe, as surely and as carefully as he.[NEWLINE]He ran as hard and as long as he could, slipping on patches of exposed ice, stumbling through drifts of snow, tripping over the rocks and branches they sometimes concealed, sparing fewer and fewer glances behind him where the Nyxkin rode at an easy lope on a steed bred and born and raised to hunt in snow and ice and frigid cold. Sometimes she drew nearer, and he saw her over his left shoulder or his right, and he hurried faster, turning to put her at his back, but she never quite closed the distance though toward the end as his steps faltered, the leopard seemed to snap at his very heels, and he ran on, panting with exhaustion, no longer even noticing the cold. He wanted to believe he'd led them far enough away, that they would suppose him a lone exile and not part of a refugee band, but he knew that no distance could be great enough - as surely as he knew that the Nyxkin and her snow leopard were toying with him, playing like a hunting cat with its food - and more and more apparently, also herding him somewhere. He would have assumed it was a trap had he not known he was caught already - and known that she knew.[NEWLINE]Later, Marelan would hardly remember the final stretch, the little temporary settlement whose Svartalfar guards allowed his passage at a signal from the Nyxkin, the little shelter into which she herded him effortlessly. He didn't remember crossing the threshold, nor falling to his knees, nor crawling the last few steps, nor curling up to sleep. He would only remember waking, shaken from slumber by a stranger's hand, half surprised and deeply grateful to have slept, and to be alive.[NEWLINE]The warmth in the little shelter was a warmth of many people huddled together inside: Svartalfar men filing quietly out into the temporary settlement outside. The one who had wakened Marelan said, "Come; you mustn't miss breakfast," and when Marelan shared their meal with them - a meager feast of winter gruel provided by the same Nyxkin who had chased him - it seemed to him that nothing in his memory had ever tasted so delicious.[NEWLINE]The Svartalfar manservants already, without need of any command, were beginning to organize themselves into work teams. Their faces betrayed no emotion, but in their every action, Marelan could see their eagerness to show themselves able and willing, to prove themselves in service to their mistresses. In spite of himself, Marelan could feel a kind of kinship and even envy as he watched them. Like his tiger under the hand of the huntress who cared for it, these Svartalfar men had food and shelter, warmth and company, and soon an opportunity to do useful labor, and especially in the terrible, ever-deepening winter, this was more than many beings could hope for in the world. All they had to do in exchange was to leave the thinking, all the endless hard decisions, to beautiful, powerful Svartalfar women. It was easy to understand, to empathize with the choices of his tiger and of all the Svartalfar men; the allure of surrender spoke to Marelan's deepest instincts. He was more than a beast of instict though, and more than a Svartalfar male raised into a life of willing service. Marelan was a man of faith, and his faith was not compatible with theirs.[NEWLINE]The Nyxkin was watching him again, and he dared not meet her gaze; he needed to think, and wasn't ready to do battle with those dark, intriguing eyes. He had strength again, as he had not at the end of his taxing ritual of the day before, but he had seen the huntress nearby who had tamed his tiger to her hand; to call another would only provide her with another pet. For that matter, to fight them at all could only help to renew the civil war that they seemed prepared, at least in his case, at least for the space of a meal and a night's rest, to suspend. There was peace ... at least a moment's peace before the next betrayal. He was somehow welcomed into what he would not long before have called the enemy camp. He saw clearly at last that there was only one thing he could do.[NEWLINE]Letting go at last completely of all the needs and all the wishes of his body, letting go of his body itself, he prayed and called upon the power of his faith with all his last reserves of strength and life, and changed himself both in his shape and in his very nature, growing like a jungle shoot, but far more swiftly than any living plant in even the lushest of jungles had ever grown. Spires grew upon the spot where Marelan had stood, shaped from enormous, bright green leaves, and together formed a little temple - very small in that hard and icy land, but still by everything that Marelan had given to it, everything that he had been, complete. Invested with his life and his emotions, his kinship and empathy for them, his little temple of the ancient forest rites stood within the Svartalfar settlement, not as a challenge but as a gift.[NEWLINE]Feline footsteps, all but silent, crossed the threshold, and the dark-eyed Nyxkin who had chased and herded Marelan looked around. She slowly circled the interior with her hunting cat, just one corner of her lips touched with her little, dangerous smile. She slid from her snow leopard's back with the same easy feline grace he had admired against his will the day before, and she circled closer, touching the very altar, brushing it gently as she passed, and Marelan could feel her presence and her fingertips as if upon his living heart. Remade as a temple, bound to his ancient faith, he no longer was susceptible to her beauty, to the catlike grace of her movements, and yet somehow her presence still nearly burned him with hope and fear. She still represented danger, deep and deadly danger to the temple he had become and to the people whom he loved, never safe in their encampment, never far enough away. She still could somehow thrill him when her fingers touched the altar ... and then at last, he could see why: Her touch was soft, caressing, like her touch upon his new-born sapling leaves. In her dark eyes, amid her deadly power, her confidence and strength, her deep and feline curiosity, her interest, her attention, he sensed the thing that his whole being yearned to feel from her: Her approval, quiet, calm, but unmistakable, for his life and for his work, and maybe, maybe, if he dared even to hope it, for his faith.[NEWLINE]She met with her commander at the temple threshold, resting her hand upon the doorframe with gentle, almost proprietary care. Almost purring, she whispered, "Look what I brought home."[NEWLINE]The commander of the Nyxkin did not purr in reply. Her voice was stronger and more confident than even her officer's dark eyes ... and yet she too seemed to approve. "Well hunted, and well guided, and my gratitude to him; we may need all the knowledge and resources we can find if this cruel winter's deepening goes on. Let some shelter here who wish to learn the ancient rites he used, for he will share them, having shared his faith with us."</Spanish>

		<English>The malakim where a dissolute people, easy prey for those more organized or better equipped. Teutorix's tribe was hunted across the desert by the Calabim vampire and their moroi, eager to find more prey. During a sudden attack in the middle of the night, his entire family was slaughtered and he was separated from his kin. While wandering away across the desert, he fell through the ground, entering an old dwarven building buried by the sand. Lighting an old lamp found inside, he explored this odd structure, discovering what he thought were sacks of grain but in fact filled with a strange black powder. But when he turned to leave, a vampire, that had followed him through the desert, was standing in the doorway. Jumping in surprise, he dropped the lamp onto the powder, and was pushed strongly onto the wall by the resulting explosion and was knocked out. When he awoke, he noticed that the vampire had been ripped to shreds by some pieces of iron that had been in front of the bag of strange powder. Thanking the gods for his survival, Teutorix wondered, how could the power of this strange powder be controlled?...[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A tall man with a long hollow metal rod walked into the malakim camp.[NEWLINE]"Teutorix!

		<English>The Walls of Torrelerial towered over the countryside, imposing, forbidding, looming. Archers patrolled at close and regular intervals, ballistae were mounted on each of the watchtowers, and guardsmen controlled every approach to the massive gates. The Bannor had enough to stop even the largest of the armies Erebus could mass against it, from Orcish hordes to Luchuirp Golem legions. But not enough to even hinder me.[NEWLINE]I turned from the window of the room of the inn I had rented. The outskirts of the city were perfect for the early stages of the mission, as I could observe the movement of the guards and surreptitiously test the defenses of the city. Physical and magical, though neither would pose much of a problem.[NEWLINE]Finally, I was ready. I softly hummed a tune, and the walls of the inn blurred like soft butter. My surroundings refocused into a dark alleyway in the middle of the city. I had time for a brief smile, before what felt like a giant's hand grabbed me and my environs blurred again, to finally refocus into a very solid stone wall. I hummed another tune, searching for what had grabbed me, what new defense the Bannor had developed against me and my like. My song ran along all the threads of magic running through the city, playing lightly along what was clearly the defensive magics: Bannor castings always have a more martial feel to them. There, I had found my captor, a series of glyphs inscribed in the city walls. As I listened, they faded again, falling dormant. Good. That meant that they weren't still keeping me here, neutralizing my magic. I glanced around my cell, and saw that I was alone. What dim light there was came from a series of glowing runes in the walls. These runes were meant to keep me from chanting my way out, but were woefully inadequate. They were only designed to keep me from transporting myself out. However, no Amurite, let alone chanter, would be stopped by any spell that targeted only one magic. I sang softly, again, and felt the characteristic tingle of my body falling slightly out of phase with the rest of the world. I quickly went through the wall, chanting myself into shadow as I went.[NEWLINE]I took my bearings once I was through. the cell was in the bowels of the palace. I smirked. Seemingly the Bannor were trying to make this easy for me. They were fools to put such faith in their own spellcasters. Chanting magic was rare, even among the Amurites. There was no way they could possibly come up with an appropriate defense.[NEWLINE]Stalking from shadow to shadow, I made my way towards the upper levels of the palace, where my mark undoubtedly slept. I passed patrol after patrol, guardsman after guardsman, and even an oathtaker, but they were so secure, so content in their perceived safety that they cast barely a glance at a patch of shadow on the wall.[NEWLINE]The Kill was almost too easy. A quick cut across the neck, above his feathered snake neckelace, and High Chancellor Aldwin became the late and regretted High Chancellor Aldwin, and with his death died the Bannor plans to attack the rich Plains of Grigori. Those would be amurite, as would the vast deposits of mana found within.</English>

Archers patrolled at close and regular intervals, ballistae were mounted on each of the watchtowers, and guardsmen controlled every approach to the massive gates. The Bannor had enough to stop even the largest of the armies Erebus could mass against it, from Orcish hordes to Luchuirp Golem legions. But not enough to even hinder me.[NEWLINE]I turned from the window of the room of the inn I had rented. The outskirts of the city were perfect for the early stages of the mission, as I could observe the movement of the guards and surreptitiously test the defenses of the city. Physical and magical, though neither would pose much of a problem.[NEWLINE]Finally, I was ready. I softly hummed a tune, and the walls of the inn blurred like soft butter. My surroundings refocused into a dark alleyway in the middle of the city. I had time for a brief smile, before what felt like a giant's hand grabbed me and my environs blurred again, to finally refocus into a very solid stone wall. I hummed another tune, searching for what had grabbed me, what new defense the Bannor had developed against me and my like. My song ran along all the threads of magic running through the city, playing lightly along what was clearly the defensive magics: Bannor castings always have a more martial feel to them. There, I had found my captor, a series of glyphs inscribed in the city walls. As I listened, they faded again, falling dormant. Good. That meant that they weren't still keeping me here, neutralizing my magic. I glanced around my cell, and saw that I was alone. What dim light there was came from a series of glowing runes in the walls. These runes were meant to keep me from chanting my way out, but were woefully inadequate. They were only designed to keep me from transporting myself out. However, no Amurite, let alone chanter, would be stopped by any spell that targeted only one magic. I sang softly, again, and felt the characteristic tingle of my body falling slightly out of phase with the rest of the world. I quickly went through the wall, chanting myself into shadow as I went.[NEWLINE]I took my bearings once I was through. the cell was in the bowels of the palace. I smirked. Seemingly the Bannor were trying to make this easy for me. They were fools to put such faith in their own spellcasters. Chanting magic was rare, even among the Amurites. There was no way they could possibly come up with an appropriate defense.[NEWLINE]Stalking from shadow to shadow, I made my way towards the upper levels of the palace, where my mark undoubtedly slept. I passed patrol after patrol, guardsman after guardsman, and even an oathtaker, but they were so secure, so content in their perceived safety that they cast barely a glance at a patch of shadow on the wall.[NEWLINE]The Kill was almost too easy. A quick cut across the neck, above his feathered snake neckelace, and High Chancellor Aldwin became the late and regretted High Chancellor Aldwin, and with his death died the Bannor plans to attack the rich Plains of Grigori. Those would be amurite, as would the vast deposits of mana found within.</Spanish>

		<English>Thedro was a shy boy. For the son of a lanunic fisherman it was perfectly normal to have a deep relationship with the sea and its inhabitants, but Thedro admired the creatures of the water more than humans. One day he watched as his father and a few other fishermen came ashore with a very large tortoise and were talking about how many days they could feast on it. When the men were gone away to call the other people from the village and brag with their prey, he crept to the animal and freed it from the heavy dew, which prevented it from going back into the sea.[NEWLINE]Captain Jeddak, an infamous corsar, gave, in each and every quayside bar or smuggling den, his report on an incredible event, which happened directly in front of his eyes. On a large island where he and his men wanted to bunker fresh water, was a young man sitting at the beach. Right next to him laid a giant tortoise in the sand. When the two saw the ship, the young man climbed on the back of the tortoise and both swam away in a hurry.[NEWLINE]Shipwrecked reports say that there are some Lanun who form a rare unity with the giant tortoises of Erebus. They advise each captain to immediately tack around when spotting such a Dragon Tortoise on the horizon.</English>

		<English>Deep in the Underhome, there is a cavern held most sacred by the children of Kilmorph. Within lies a massive crystal of Earth mana, the largest ever found by the Khazad in their underground expeditions. To the dwarves, this crystal was a blessing from the Earth Mother.[NEWLINE]When they first struck into the cavern, the latent mana seeped out into the rest of the Underhome. Veins of gold literally grew into the rock, simultaneously enriching and endangering the dwarves as their halls came under assault from the shifting earth. From then onwards, only the highest of the priesthood of the dwarves is permitted within the hallowed chamber, for such power is not to be manipulated on a whim.[NEWLINE]Now that the Khazad have begun their quest to establish an empire upon the surface of Erebus, perhaps the dwarves may have a reason to release the power of the Motherlode once more. The land itself will rise, and mines will run with a temporary but bountiful river of gold on the command of the Khazad leader. Surely the Khazad will have a use for their newly-arrived wealth; whether for war or peace.</English>

		<English>We had been stationed in a small southern town after reports came that frostlings had been causing mischief and scaring the townsfolk. Things were easy until our lookouts announced the arrival of the White Hand. They approached, and their priest began his work. We immediately felt the air change. The warm summer breeze changed direction and became a crisp autumn gust whipping back and forth. Fear set in all around as we looked to the sky and saw the scattered clouds moving fast. Rather than moving in one direction, they were oddly moving toward the same point directly above the town. The clouds pressed together, compressing and growing, swirling together and becoming opaquely white. Soon the mass appeared to be hanging unnaturally in the sky, or so we thought. The visual change from growing to falling was unnoticable to us below it, and before we could move--WHUMP!--the snowfall hit, burying us all. I scrambled underneath the snow, digging my way upward. I pushed through to the surface and was blinded by the sun's reflection on the white landscape. The sky above was a brilliant, pure blue. I saw others emerge from the banks, screaming in panic and near asphyxiation. I gasped in horror as I saw faint shapes moving quickly across the snow's surface, deftly cutting the throats of those who peeked their heads up. I threw myself back into the snowbank and buried myself. I feared I was dishonoring my lads, but don't know what I could have done. I only prayed I wouldn't be found, and lay in fear until the summer sun melted the snow. What I saw when I emerged was a river of blood, the melting snow washing the ground with red water. The White Hand was gone. They didn't take the town, they just killed everyone in it.</English>

		<English>In a certain year in the Age of Magic, when the elven people had spread far across the north, Faeryl Viconia decided that she had little left to gain by spending all her strength within the great palace of the elves in Evermore. Her agents and assassins were in place around the city, her influence was as strong as she could reasonably expect it to be for a Queen who ruled but six months in every year, and the cloying cheerfulness of the Summer Court each year was beginning to wear upon her. So she approached the Summer Queen Arendel Phaedra, and said to her, "It is a pleasure to share my summers with your bright and beautiful court, but the palace grows crowded, and it seems unfit to me that the Winter Queen should disport herself in summer play at a time when in the north of our empire there is snow and cold little milder than what we call winter here. It would be wiser, in the summer months, for me to bring a part of my court to a palace built for the purpose in the far north, that I might see up close how the people of those harsh climes live, and bring the knowledge with me to the aid of the rest of our people when winter comes for a while to all our empire."Arendel was deeply reluctant to agree, for she dearly loved the company of Faeryl and her court, but Faeryl returned to the subject again and again, reminding Arendel of how it would gladden the people of the north and help her best perform her winter duties, and though she could do so only in sorrow, the Summer Queen saw the wisdom in Faeryl's words. So at last, after many exhortations, she agreed, and the Winter Palace of the elves was built in the land where it was ever winter, and when it was finished at last, Faeryl Viconia and her Winter Court made it their summer residence, and she assisted the Summer Court by ruling those northern lands where the weather was always as cold as the season of her rule, almost as though in that place she were Queen still and had not performed the Rites of Spring - and when the time came to perform the Rites of Autumn, she left her hardiest lieutenants to maintain and strengthen her influence there in preparation for her return come spring - but the most deadly of her servants and secret attendants came never near the Winter Palace, for they had other secret duties to perform for her at the heart of the empire's power throughout the year.</English>

As a particulary hard hit crashed against the door, the last bit of light faded from the windows in the ceiling of the cavern.[NEWLINE]"MY lords, we won't last the night." a young, pale faced officer scurried to the table, where the Nine Kings of the last free Hippus tribes Planned. over them, laying limp in the still and muggy air of the cavern, where horses and men had been lodged for days, Banners dangled. Once beautiful, resplendant in the sun, as the massed armies of the hippus rode through the plains, they now lay faded and dirty. [NEWLINE]"The clan's brought in three stoneskins."[NEWLINE]One of the younger kings looked up at the officer, and the officer could read despair in his eyes. "we're lost... why do we keep fighting? Where are our allies; where are the ljosalfar, who brought us into this war?" he muttered.[NEWLINE]"We wll ride... the last ride of the Hippus..." the oldest of the kings spoke "Call the men to arms! Saddle the horses... We will not be forgotten. The we may ride to riun, we will be remembered." His eyes shone, and he donnes his helm, the plume of horsehair flapping as if from an unearthly breeze.[NEWLINE]It was quick. the men had been expecting a ride for a while, had kept thier swords neer, kept the horses rested and saddled. They mounted, and formed a great line in front of the door. They lowered thier lances, and waited for the signal.[NEWLINE]"So few remain," the young king looked behind sadly "We ride in vain."[NEWLINE]"It is worth it." the old king said, "We will not be forgotten." they both unsheathed thier swords, though the young king slightly more hesitantly, and wheeled thier horses to the front of the formation.[NEWLINE]Those at the door released it just as a stonesking ogre hit it a final blow. The door flew open, shards of stone and wood scattering everywhere. the massed hordes of the clan orcs poured in, and fell back, hesitated for a moment. Hornes sounded, and the remanants of the hippus nation poured out through the door. hundreds of clan orcs died that die, along with one of the stonesking ogres. the Last of the Hippus fell, and the light ofthe horsemasters was extinguished. that was the end."[NEWLINE]The old ministrel put away his lute, a beautiful instument, carved with stylized horse heads. his face was weathered, and looked like stone in the flickering light of the campfire. The children stared up at him expectantly.[NEWLINE]"But Sir, you're wrong. the hippus are still here."[NEWLINE]He looked at them and sighed. "That story is for another night... how the great lord Tasunke rose from being a clan slave, captured at the last battle, and united the few remaining free petty lords. how he led them in victory after victory against the clan, and how Rhoanna came up with he plan to make the hippus the most feared and respected nation. I'll tell children tomorrow, if you're good."</Spanish>

Yet most of this masonry knowledge was lost during the long winter of Mulcarn so when new settlements began to grow after the ice receded, the best that could be done was palisades made from wood. Early palisades were merely a collection of crude, interlocked abatis which were more to protect from dangerous animals then from a advancing army. Later, these would give rise to wooden walls and later still to impressive assemblies of ditches and other earthworks to compliment the wooden walls. While cheap and easy to construct, palisades were quickly replaced by stone walls as the art of construction was rediscovered.</English>

		<English>It was an impenetrable legion. [NEWLINE]Her eyes widened; she'd been told not to show emotion or weakness, but there were just [ITALIC]so many orcs[\ITALIC].  And not just a teeming mass of orcs - each of these orcs were armoured in mithril armor, wielding mithril axes.  Many were sparring, and sparring with a skill far beyond that of any new recruit.[NEWLINE]There was no way any one nation could handle this many orcs at once.  Tentatively, hesitantly, she turned to her orcish guide, almost afraid of the answer.  "Against whom does this army march?"[NEWLINE]The guide's face was impassive - he knew.  None of these orcs were going to come back home.  One eye shifted to the woman.[NEWLINE]"The surviving Boss said it was a deer with wings, before he got eaten.  Might be a horse or something.  No orc has ever seen it before.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Eyes like the pits of hell. Wings borne aloft on the screams of its victims. Hooves slick with the blood of the civilized. Ears ringing with the final screams of the doomed. Murderhoof is upon us, and there can be no salvation.[NEWLINE] It's a being of rage incarnate. The final embers of wrath of a world facing oblivion. It does not seek victory, because victory implies anyone left behind to applaud the winner. It does not seek peace, because the time for that passed with the slaying of Sucellus. It does not seek power for that requires another to compare against. It is the mount of Os-Gabella, the sire of Nox's Steed. It is Murderhoof and it is death on feathered wings.</English>

		<English>"What are you more scared of? The Balseraphs or the Ljosalfar?" Orsen asked his friend, Mikal.[NEWLINE] "Well," Mikal said, "The Balseraphs are, at least supposedly, on our side. But those rituals they do give me the creeps. And those strange, noisy weapons... I don't care what our battlemage says about 'chemicals' and 'powders' and dwarvish contraptions, I say they're dark magic. I understand the Elves. They want forests, we want cities, but there's only enough room for one. But I'll never understand the Balseraphs."[NEWLINE] Orsen agreed. "And mark my words," he added, "once the Elves are gone they'll turn on us."
[NEWLINE]The Kuriotate scouts had been sent into the thick forests to seek out any Ljosalfar encampents. The forests were thick and wild. Animals were waiting in ambush for the unwary, and after that Balseraph regiment had been wiped out by a treant, they and the Kuriotates were constantly bickering about who would be going first.
[NEWLINE]"Look at that... I think there's a clearing up..." Mikal suddenly stopped, and then, made two motions. "Be quiet" and "come here."[NEWLINE] Orsen followed carefully. There was indeed a clearing.[NEWLINE] And what was in it was... impossible.
[NEWLINE]"I thought they were myths..." Orsen whispered.[NEWLINE] "Might be a trap, though. Or it might be vicious... you can never tell in these woods..." Mikal shook his head.[NEWLINE] "Can't you feel it... that aura of truth and love? One of Sirona's creatures, surely... peace in living form. It's wonderful."
[NEWLINE]A unicorn. The friends stood in silent awe for several seconds afterwards. Then, cautiously, Mikal left the brush and approached it. The peaceful creature turned, unconcerned towards Mikal, but made no aggresive moves. Mikal slowly approached, his hands outstretched...
[NEWLINE]An explosion rang out. The unicorn's head flew clean off, and the Kuriotates heard a shrill cry of "Boom-shaka-laka! Dinnertime, boys!" They gaped in shock as a small pack of Balseraphs, grinning insanely and wielding their mysterious, horrifying weapons leapt out to examine the unicorn's corpse.[NEWLINE] "Start up a fire, ladies! I love me some horse meat. And whatever the hell is growing outta this thing's head, I'm sure it'll look really nice on my mantle! Shiny bits for the win!" The leader of the Balseraph soldiers cut off the unicorn's horn from the bit of head that it was stuck to and placed it in one of the few pockets on his coat not already overstuffed with baubles and trinkets.
[NEWLINE]Only then did he notice Mikal and Orsen. "Oi, Kuriotates! Was that your horse? If so, sorry 'bout that but you shouldn't let the thing loose and unsaddled. We were hungry, after all!"[NEWLINE] Mikal barely manage to shake his head. "No, it wasn't yours? Good to hear! Some treehugger is doubtless wondering what happened to his mount-slash-lover right now. He'll get over it... when we blow his brain to bits, that is!" The Balseraph cackled insanely at the image of some Ljoslfar's head being blasted to pieces.[NEWLINE] "There's enough horsemeat for all of us, by the way, and one of our new recruits cooks horse meat real good. Worked in the stables, 'disposing' of horses that lost too many races. Care for some?"
[NEWLINE]Still unable to believe what they had just witnessed, Mikal and Orsen again shook their heads and walked off. "Suit yourselves," the Balseraph yelled. "Yeesh," he added to his mates, "they looked miserable. Poor suckers. Ah well, not my problem." And with that, the small Balseraph squad sat down to enjoy the only unicorn on Erebus, cooked medium rare.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]AH, YOU'RE THAT UNICORN. YOU SURVIVED TWO HOURS... A NEW RECORD.[NEWLINE] "What happened to me?"[NEWLINE] THE BALSERAPHS WERE HUNGRY. THEY SAW YOU AND DECIDED TO EAT YOU.[NEWLINE] "Who are you?"[NEWLINE] DEATH.[NEWLINE] "Then I'm... dead? Why would they kill me?"[NEWLINE] I ALREADY SAID, THEY WERE HUNGRY. THERE'S ALSO THE PRINCESS RULE. IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN, BUT BASICALLY IT MEANS CUDDLY THINGS DIE QUICKLY HERE. ONLY EXCEPTION IS PENGUINS... THEY'RE PROTECTED BY AN OBSCURE LOOPHOLE IN THE COMPACT. JUST BE GLAD YOUR DEATH WAS QUICK AND PAINLESS. THE BALSERAPHS WERE TOO HUNGRY TO GET... CREATIVE. "[NEWLINE]Who would eat a unicorn?"[NEWLINE] THE BALSERAPHS. TRUST ME, THEY'VE DONE WORSE. "[NEWLINE]But I was sent to bring peace and hope!"[NEWLINE] WHERE FROM? [NEWLINE]"Far, far away..."[NEWLINE] SOMEWHERE WITH HAPPILY EVER AFTERS? [NEWLINE]"Yes..." [NEWLINE]WELCOME TO EREBUS. THERE AREN'T MANY OF THOSE HERE. [NEWLINE]"What is the Angel of Hope doing? He should be making sure people live happily ever after, that every Princess finds her Prince Charming..." [NEWLINE]HE IS PRESENTLY PLANNING THE SLAUGHTER AND DAMNATION OF EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD IN THIS UNIVERSE, TO AVENGE A PETTY AND CHILDISH GRUDGE WITH THE ONE. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"What sort of place is this, where madmen eat unicorns, happily ever afters don't happen, and even angels fall from heaven?" [NEWLINE]AN INTERESTING ONE.</English>

Some treehugger is doubtless wondering what happened to his mount-slash-lover right now. He'll get over it... when we blow his brain to bits, that is!" The Balseraph cackled insanely at the image of some Ljoslfar's head being blasted to pieces.[NEWLINE] "There's enough horsemeat for all of us, by the way, and one of our new recruits cooks horse meat real good. Worked in the stables, 'disposing' of horses that lost too many races. Care for some?"
[NEWLINE]Still unable to believe what they had just witnessed, Mikal and Orsen again shook their heads and walked off. "Suit yourselves," the Balseraph yelled. "Yeesh," he added to his mates, "they looked miserable. Poor suckers. Ah well, not my problem." And with that, the small Balseraph squad sat down to enjoy the only unicorn on Erebus, cooked medium rare.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]AH, YOU'RE THAT UNICORN. YOU SURVIVED TWO HOURS... A NEW RECORD.[NEWLINE] "What happened to me?"[NEWLINE] THE BALSERAPHS WERE HUNGRY. THEY SAW YOU AND DECIDED TO EAT YOU.[NEWLINE] "Who are you?"[NEWLINE] DEATH.[NEWLINE] "Then I'm... dead? Why would they kill me?"[NEWLINE] I ALREADY SAID, THEY WERE HUNGRY. THERE'S ALSO THE PRINCESS RULE. IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN, BUT BASICALLY IT MEANS CUDDLY THINGS DIE QUICKLY HERE. ONLY EXCEPTION IS PENGUINS... THEY'RE PROTECTED BY AN OBSCURE LOOPHOLE IN THE COMPACT. JUST BE GLAD YOUR DEATH WAS QUICK AND PAINLESS. THE BALSERAPHS WERE TOO HUNGRY TO GET... CREATIVE. "[NEWLINE]Who would eat a unicorn?"[NEWLINE] THE BALSERAPHS. TRUST ME, THEY'VE DONE WORSE. "[NEWLINE]But I was sent to bring peace and hope!"[NEWLINE] WHERE FROM? [NEWLINE]"Far, far away..."[NEWLINE] SOMEWHERE WITH HAPPILY EVER AFTERS? [NEWLINE]"Yes..." [NEWLINE]WELCOME TO EREBUS. THERE AREN'T MANY OF THOSE HERE. [NEWLINE]"What is the Angel of Hope doing? He should be making sure people live happily ever after, that every Princess finds her Prince Charming..." [NEWLINE]HE IS PRESENTLY PLANNING THE SLAUGHTER AND DAMNATION OF EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD IN THIS UNIVERSE, TO AVENGE A PETTY AND CHILDISH GRUDGE WITH THE ONE. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"What sort of place is this, where madmen eat unicorns, happily ever afters don't happen, and even angels fall from heaven?" [NEWLINE]AN INTERESTING ONE.</French>
		<German>"What are you more scared of? The Balseraphs or the Ljosalfar?" Orsen asked his friend, Mikal.[NEWLINE] "Well," Mikal said, "The Balseraphs are, at least supposedly, on our side. But those rituals they do give me the creeps. And those strange, noisy weapons... I don't care what our battlemage says about 'chemicals' and 'powders' and dwarvish contraptions, I say they're dark magic. I understand the Elves. They want forests, we want cities, but there's only enough room for one. But I'll never understand the Balseraphs."[NEWLINE] Orsen agreed. "And mark my words," he added, "once the Elves are gone they'll turn on us."
[NEWLINE]The Kuriotate scouts had been sent into the thick forests to seek out any Ljosalfar encampents. The forests were thick and wild. Animals were waiting in ambush for the unwary, and after that Balseraph regiment had been wiped out by a treant, they and the Kuriotates were constantly bickering about who would be going first.
[NEWLINE]"Look at that... I think there's a clearing up..." Mikal suddenly stopped, and then, made two motions. "Be quiet" and "come here."[NEWLINE] Orsen followed carefully. There was indeed a clearing.[NEWLINE] And what was in it was... impossible.
[NEWLINE]"I thought they were myths..." Orsen whispered.[NEWLINE] "Might be a trap, though. Or it might be vicious... you can never tell in these woods..." Mikal shook his head.[NEWLINE] "Can't you feel it... that aura of truth and love? One of Sirona's creatures, surely... peace in living form. It's wonderful."
[NEWLINE]A unicorn. The friends stood in silent awe for several seconds afterwards. Then, cautiously, Mikal left the brush and approached it. The peaceful creature turned, unconcerned towards Mikal, but made no aggresive moves. Mikal slowly approached, his hands outstretched...
[NEWLINE]An explosion rang out. The unicorn's head flew clean off, and the Kuriotates heard a shrill cry of "Boom-shaka-laka! Dinnertime, boys!" They gaped in shock as a small pack of Balseraphs, grinning insanely and wielding their mysterious, horrifying weapons leapt out to examine the unicorn's corpse.[NEWLINE] "Start up a fire, ladies! I love me some horse meat. And whatever the hell is growing outta this thing's head, I'm sure it'll look really nice on my mantle! Shiny bits for the win!" The leader of the Balseraph soldiers cut off the unicorn's horn from the bit of head that it was stuck to and placed it in one of the few pockets on his coat not already overstuffed with baubles and trinkets.
[NEWLINE]Only then did he notice Mikal and Orsen. "Oi, Kuriotates! Was that your horse? If so, sorry 'bout that but you shouldn't let the thing loose and unsaddled.

		<English>Capturing units after battler is a key part of the game. It can take many varied forms and it may be a bit unclear what's happening in a given case. Thus, we'll take a look at the various situations, by order of priority:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET] First, we have units that can capture others based on their Combat type ( for example, Units with Subdue Animals or Boarding Crew). Those are handled first, with a capture chance specific to the situation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The other situations all use the general capture chance, which units can get natively, or come from traits, promotions, civics,... Those various sources stack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]In those situations, the priority case is when the captured units is turned into another kind of unit (mostly slaves, and a few necromancy related situations).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][TAB][ICON_BULLET]Finally, if none of the above situations are relevant, the captured unit is just converted to its new civ, with some Promotions possibly applied on capture ( for example, in a Werewolf's case).</English>

		<English>The Svartalfar lost the Elven Civil War, mostly due to their own infighting. In particular, Rivanna the Wraith Lord tried to assassinate Faeryl Viconia several times. She fashioned the Aphelion Amulet, which allows the bearer to impersonate another in all manners. The amulet is unusual because it activates only on the night of Yule each year. At that point the bearer can select a target to impersonate, and they remain as that person in all ways for the next year. Not even dying or removing the amulet will break the spell, until that year has passed. Rivanna used it to try to impersonate Faeryl. She was reigning as Faeryl when the Ljosalfar came and executed her. Arendel Phaedra ruled the Reunited Fey empire until Yule, when Faeryl activated the Aphelion Amulet to impersonate Queen Phaedra. The real Arendel was trapped in the catacombs beneath Evermore for centuries as Faeryl's misrule led the Umbrawood to its doom.

Anything he swallows is lost forever, including many angels, dragons and giants during the Godswar.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Agares bound each of the Unraveling at the forging of the Compact. He transformed Apophis into an ordinary seeming goat, and Apophis remains in creation in this humble form. He has wandered widely but spends most of his time in the Balseraph lands. He occasionally joins adventuring parties, causing trouble, kneecapping ogres and eating everything in sight. He tends to favor adventurers who are drunks, liars and thieves. There is a statue of him in Jubilee, built after he chased away a pyromancer that was threatening the city. He traveled for a while with Maros the Umberguard and saved Maros's life on more than one occasion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In either form, Apophis is largely immune to mind, body and spirit magic. He is nearly indestructible and attempting to transform him will draw the attention of wraiths*. He can also destroy most magical items by devouring them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Transformation, especially one that doesn't erode over time, is well outside of the entropy dominion so Agares used a bone circlet to maintain the spell.

		<English>Of the 21 god's there was Oghma, the god of knowledge. 
His "priests"  were librarians, scholars and teachers. And the Age of Magic was a good age for them. They called themselves the Laeran Cord, and they were welcomed in nearly all nations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

When the Age of Ice started nations fell to ruin. Survival became more important than learning and the Larean Cord attempted to consolidate and protect their studies. The Doviello took particular delight in finding and burning these hidden libraries.

The Laraen Cord dwindled to just one man, now the high priest of his religion by default. Akharien means "the last one". A scholar with nothing but a frozen world to study, a teacher without anyone to teach. He wasn't that old. He was born during the Age of Ice, so he never saw the world outside of what he read of in the libraries books.

In time hunting parties didn't return. Some priests went mad. Others died of starvation or age. And only he was left. When the Doviello came for him they offered him the chance to flee into the wilderness, to survive as a wolf so that one day he could hunt with them. But he threw himself on the books instead. He begged them to burn him instead of the books. He promised to tell them the stories contained within, and to teach them about the medicinal uses of the few plants that survived in the region.

They didn't accept his offer. He was burned within his library. He was the last priest of the Laeran Cord of his Age.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
After his death the man's spirit didn't pass on to Oghma's vault. Instead he remained in the ruins of his library among the fluttering ashes of the brunt books. In death he had more power than in life and the Doviello learned to avoid the place. But others that came and slept nearby would dream of other places and other times. They would hear stories and be inspired.

Early in the Age of Rebirth the Laeran Cord was refounded and a priest sought out this library and found its meager ruins. The only thing of value that he found within was the high priests crown, which he took to bring to the current church so that it could serve Oghma again.</English>

His "priests"  were librarians, scholars and teachers. And the Age of Magic was a good age for them. They called themselves the Laeran Cord, and they were welcomed in nearly all nations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

When the Age of Ice started nations fell to ruin. Survival became more important than learning and the Larean Cord attempted to consolidate and protect their studies. The Doviello took particular delight in finding and burning these hidden libraries.

The Laraen Cord dwindled to just one man, now the high priest of his religion by default. Akharien means "the last one". A scholar with nothing but a frozen world to study, a teacher without anyone to teach. He wasn't that old. He was born during the Age of Ice, so he never saw the world outside of what he read of in the libraries books.

In time hunting parties didn't return. Some priests went mad. Others died of starvation or age. And only he was left. When the Doviello came for him they offered him the chance to flee into the wilderness, to survive as a wolf so that one day he could hunt with them. But he threw himself on the books instead. He begged them to burn him instead of the books. He promised to tell them the stories contained within, and to teach them about the medicinal uses of the few plants that survived in the region.

They didn't accept his offer. He was burned within his library. He was the last priest of the Laeran Cord of his Age.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
After his death the man's spirit didn't pass on to Oghma's vault. Instead he remained in the ruins of his library among the fluttering ashes of the brunt books. In death he had more power than in life and the Doviello learned to avoid the place. But others that came and slept nearby would dream of other places and other times. They would hear stories and be inspired.

But when in contact the practitioner can call on all aspects of the world to either imbue themselves with these aspects or transform the earth and stone around them.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Because their power comes from contact with the earth many practitioners of this dominion choose not to wear shoes. Their magic will work through the short distance, but it is weakened. Because of their affinity and because their feet are in direct contact with the earth they can often sense anyone walking nearby. Masters of this dominion stop needing to breathe and can be mistaken for being dead, which isn't helped by the fact that they sometimes bury themselves when meditating.

		<English>This dominion never works overtly. Instead the aspects of objects are enhanced by it. Without other dominions, only existing aspects can be heightened, a wall can be made stronger, a sword sharper. But with ties with fire a sword can be given a burning blade, or with darkness a charm can be made to hide the wearer. These spells take complex rituals and days, weeks, months or years to cast depending on their complexity.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Practitioners of this dominion are typically collectors of obscure and varied objects. They can sense the affinity an object has for a dominion and they are quick to gather ones with a strong affinity because it makes enchanting them in that dominion much easier. A practitioner skilled in this dominion and death is likely to have a morbid collection of items strong with death affinity nearby, murderer's knives, gravedigger's shovel, pieces of gravestones, hangman's noose, etc. They occasionally find affinity for an item that they don't expect (a key with a strong affinity for mind magic) and can spend a lot of time trying to research the history of the object to find out why.

		<English>The power of memory and thought. Practitioners can read minds and protect their thoughts from the same. The more powerful can manipulate the memories of their targets or dominate them entirely. There are a wide range of effects that can be caused by this dominion, from becoming "invisible" by causing on target to fail to notice you, to implanting thoughts (you should go out on patrol), or mistaking the senses (that stick is a snake).

		<English>The Aspects of an Angel are angels with a very specific purpose created by one of the Twenty-One. Each Angel has seven of them, and each of them are unbound by the Compact. Here are the various aspects and their role : 
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Amathaon : The Fathers of Worlds, angels who are able to turn the primal matter of the world into lands of beauty and wonder. They are corrupted by Agares during the Age of Dragons.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Sucellus : The Wild Huntsmen, angels who appear to train the strong and purge the weak.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Bhall : The Ifrits, also called the smokeless fire, who reward those willing to sacrifice everything for their passion.. Ifrit have no corporeal form and inhabit those they bless (albeit briefly, since those they possess are usually sacrificing their life for a cause).
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Kilmorph : The Anchors of Creation, keepers of the foundation, guardians of the Wishstone, imprisoners of the archangel Odio.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Lugus : The Dawnbringers.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Aeron : The Executioners of Hell,angels who were to execute those that defy the gods, but now they execute any they are called to kill.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Dagda : The Cipi ,also known as the Pillars of Creation, angels who enforce the physical laws. 
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Mammon : The Roots of Fear, who feed worry and fill future thoughts with horror. Gaelan Sedracious tried to summon one of those, but the ritual failed and the angel destroyed Gaelan's associates, before turning him into the Burnt Priest, founder of the Overlords.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Junil : The Beacon Knights, Paragons of order and heroism.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Oghma : The Historians, Recorders of all that happens. One Historian was the father of Soqed Hozi ( Kylorin's apprentice of the Law dominion). He fell in love with a mortal, spent 21 days with her and then used his power to unwrite his time with her so that no one in creation would remember it. But he did allow her to keep the twin daughters he had impregnated her with.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Camulos : The Aspects of War ,- Chaotic forces that empower those they inhabit with great martial skill. Contrary to most other Aspects, the Aspects of War are not embodied by angels, but by mortals. Both a blessing and a curse, they will always find themselves in battle, but will be divinely great at it. Known Aspects of War include Capria, Magnadine, Mahon the Butcher, Orthus, Surder, Arak the Erkling, and Makhai the Ogre.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Nantosuelta : The Glories, Powerful forces that bind a ruler to his kingdom, and are passed through generations. 
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Ceridwen : The Seven Sisters, weird women from other worlds. They were close to Gabella and Alexis and Flauros call them Aunts.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Sirona : The Dovoveo,  Keepers of remote lands where there is no war and age is fleeting. Within their site, they have almost complete control and these sites tend to be the most sacred of holy areas.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET] Esus : The Masks, angels turned into artifacts who hide all that is done by the one they possess. Esus routinely uses one to enter creation and break the Compact. He also gifted them to Kylorin to help in the Ritual of the Endless Night. Later in the Age of Rebirth, Gyra, Brigit and Condatis used three of them to steal the Gems of Creation and kickstart the Age of Invention.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Tali : The Jinns, Keepers of the seven winds. They often work to release anything that is bound and are able to shapechange into a variety of forms but they have the feet of a rooster in every form.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Arawn : The Norns, angels who ensure that none escape mortality. Gabella met them hoping they could end her, but they were unable to. Furious, she trapped them into the Uror Band.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Arawn : The Phoenixes  Who provide the gift of life, health and eternal youth. Taking the form of birds, they can grow forever, but are highly sought for their blood and feathers. Once killed, an egg forms and they are born anew the next morning.  
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Danalin : The Marids, Keepers of the deepest parts of the ocean, rarely seen on land. They can call hurricanes and control the tide.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Mulcarn : The Aquilans, Who bring great blizzards with them. 
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Agares didn't create his own Aspects, but corrupted the Fathers of Worlds, who became the Unraveling, demons dedicated to the end of the world.</English>

[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Mammon : The Roots of Fear, who feed worry and fill future thoughts with horror. Gaelan Sedracious tried to summon one of those, but the ritual failed and the angel destroyed Gaelan's associates, before turning him into the Burnt Priest, founder of the Overlords.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Junil : The Beacon Knights, Paragons of order and heroism.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Oghma : The Historians, Recorders of all that happens. One Historian was the father of Soqed Hozi ( Kylorin's apprentice of the Law dominion). He fell in love with a mortal, spent 21 days with her and then used his power to unwrite his time with her so that no one in creation would remember it. But he did allow her to keep the twin daughters he had impregnated her with.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Camulos : The Aspects of War ,- Chaotic forces that empower those they inhabit with great martial skill. Contrary to most other Aspects, the Aspects of War are not embodied by angels, but by mortals. Both a blessing and a curse, they will always find themselves in battle, but will be divinely great at it. Known Aspects of War include Capria, Magnadine, Mahon the Butcher, Orthus, Surder, Arak the Erkling, and Makhai the Ogre.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Nantosuelta : The Glories, Powerful forces that bind a ruler to his kingdom, and are passed through generations.

		<English>When it became obvious that the Godswar threatened Creation, Dagda called for the war to end. The gods meet and form the Compact, an agreement that the gods would all withdraw and only interfere with creation through certain limited means.
[NEWLINE]The Compact's seven laws are:
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Boundary- No god shall enter creation. The Godslayer will signify this compact, and it will have the power to shatter any god in creation, and have no power against those on other worlds.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Influence- A god and their legions may only influence creation according to the hearts of the Sons of Nemed in that region. This way flawed ideologies will be exposed and discarded. Their hearts will be measured from least to greatest on thought, faith, worship, action and sacrifice. The Divine Court is given the authority to adjudicate and measure this use; all gods must accept their ruling. The aspects will not be bound by this limit.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Seasons- Creation will feel the touch of each god in turn, so that there will be a time that each may have a stronger influence and opportunity to grow in creation. This will create constellations, seasons, the cycle of solstices and equinoxes as well as the day and night. It will also allow for a pull on those born during that god's influence.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Source- The wells of endless material will be available to all gods, and though they will be held by their domain, a god cannot remove their gifts from creation. To this the wells are given authority over the gods, that they cannot be contained.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Providence- When a Son of Nemed dies his immortal soul will pass to the vault of the god his true heart worshiped, such that he might serve that god in eternity and aid as that god determines. Those that are uncommitted are given to Arawn and the Otherworld where the lingering images of creation will determine that souls true nature. And when it has, it will be passed to the appropriate god.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]History- The aspects of Oghma will be given authority to record the events of all worlds. No action will be hidden and no location secured against their sight. These records will be sealed to all eyes but their own, and they may not share this information with another.
[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Threshold- The power of the Sons of Nemed will be constrained to the limit of one god. That as long as a god remains, creation is secure, and the Godswar cannot be redone by man. This limit is applied to all of creation, such that one Son of Nemed could have the power of a god if he wielded it alone, or that thousands would find the power divided between them.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]For some the Compact does too much. Basium, the archangel of Arawn, rebelled and continued his battle against the Infernals regardless of the Compact. For others it did too little. Cassiel, the archangel of Dagda, rebelled believing that the gods should withdraw completely from creation instead of using men to fight their battles for them. Cassiel entered creation to teach men to ignore the will of the gods. The Godslayer was granted to Finner, mortal hero of the Age and Father to Kylorin.</English>

		<English>The Heron Throne was a part of the Patrian government, responsible for protecting the empire from internal threats, and enforcing the ever increasing laws. Chief among their roles was the tight control of magic and rituals, that it would never slip away from the control of the members of the Imprimatur Council.
[NEWLINE]The Heron Throne founded the Order not from divine inspiration but from the growing requirements of the Patrian bureaucracy. The codex of Patrian law had become so byzantine and severe that nearly autonomous inquisitors were needed to carry out it requirements. These inquisitors were magically bound to the codex so that they wouldn't become corrupted by their station. They drew upon the name of Junil, god of Law, in taking their oaths and in carrying out their brutal decrees.
[NEWLINE]These inquisitors were feared nearly as much as Kylorin's Archmages and would come to a city to adjudicate major disputes and to see that justice, as defined by the codex of Patria, was followed. Some inquisitors began to question why Patrian law superseded the worship of Junil and when the Heron Throne found out that these concerns were growing they launched the Purge of Whispers, the execution of anyone the Throne suspected of having these views. It all happened in one night, and it effectively ended any unrest and solidified the Heron Thrones hold on the Church during the Age of Magic.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Heron Throne refers to Soqed Hozi's throne, a brilliant white throne of marble from which she ruled. Soqed Hozi was the Leader of the inquisitors and Kylorin's apprentice of the Law Dominion until her death during the third Patrian rebellion. This throne would later become the one Falamar and Rhoanna would use when they settle in the Bay of Laurus.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE] Long before, the throne had been used by the Gods to bind Stephanos the White King, one of the Unraveling. In the Age of Ruin, Belphegor burnt the Bay of Laurus to destroy the throne and unleash Stephanos.</English>

Chief among their roles was the tight control of magic and rituals, that it would never slip away from the control of the members of the Imprimatur Council.
[NEWLINE]The Heron Throne founded the Order not from divine inspiration but from the growing requirements of the Patrian bureaucracy. The codex of Patrian law had become so byzantine and severe that nearly autonomous inquisitors were needed to carry out it requirements. These inquisitors were magically bound to the codex so that they wouldn't become corrupted by their station. They drew upon the name of Junil, god of Law, in taking their oaths and in carrying out their brutal decrees.
[NEWLINE]These inquisitors were feared nearly as much as Kylorin's Archmages and would come to a city to adjudicate major disputes and to see that justice, as defined by the codex of Patria, was followed. Some inquisitors began to question why Patrian law superseded the worship of Junil and when the Heron Throne found out that these concerns were growing they launched the Purge of Whispers, the execution of anyone the Throne suspected of having these views. It all happened in one night, and it effectively ended any unrest and solidified the Heron Thrones hold on the Church during the Age of Magic.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Heron Throne refers to Soqed Hozi's throne, a brilliant white throne of marble from which she ruled. Soqed Hozi was the Leader of the inquisitors and Kylorin's apprentice of the Law Dominion until her death during the third Patrian rebellion. This throne would later become the one Falamar and Rhoanna would use when they settle in the Bay of Laurus.</French>

		<Tag>TXT_KEY_EQUIPMENT_SKULL_OF_ASMODAY_PEDIA</Tag>
		<English>Asmoday is the eldest of Sallos's 34 children, and his soul was consecrated to Agares while his mother pregnant with him. When he was seven he inherited a wealthy Patrian duchy following his father's early death, but everything fell to ruin. Blights struck the crops, plagues hit his people, trade relations soured. As he grew into a young man his duchy crumbled around him. It wasn't until Kylorin came to review the duchy and explained his latent ability that Asmoday felt like anything other than a failure. As a member of the Imprimatur Council he learned control for his power and the ability to focus it to tear people, armies and empires apart.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Asmoday battled the Empyrean, broke Dies Diei, blinded the captured priests and then offered them as a gift to Alexis.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]He had an irrational hatred for elves, capturing, torturing and killing any he found. Rumors of "elven blood" in Dust citizens was often enough to get them killed. He was a member of the Coven of the Black Candle with Faeryl, but never would have participated if he had known she was there (and vise-versa since the elves knew what happened to them in his duchy and hated him for it).
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the second revolution, revolutionaries came to Dust in response to rumors that a tax had been imposed, that every village would supply a child for demonic sacrifice. These revolutionaries (thousands of farmers and workers from across Patria with crude weapons) were crushed by trained soldiers, black magic and demonic spirits. The bodies were then set on long pikes and marched back to their home cities where they were displayed impaled at the village center. The town was gathered to curse and spit on the corpses of the revolutionaries, and any that didn't were impaled and put up on a pike beside them. Then each home village was ordered to select a child for sacrifice, and they all did. This was the end of the second revolution.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the third revolution Asmoday caused the Sanctus Inquisition to turn against Basium by ringing summoning circles with the innocent, that Basium would tear through in battle and hiding mages in villages that Basium would destroy to uncover. Ultimately Basium became more feared than the Imprimatur Council and the Inquisition nearly lost support for the civil war. Rather than risk openly opposing Basium (which they feared would lead to him turning on them) the Inquisition abandoned Basium in battle, and without the protection of the golden fire Asmoday and his mages defeated Basium. They would have killed him if Basium's twin Gyra hadn't pulled him from the battlefield and into the Otherworld. Following the defeat of Basium, Kylorin went alone to face Asmoday. Within that battle Kylorin was faced with every evil action he had performed, every life he had carelessly ruined, a legacy of pain he had submitted the world to. By the end, Asmoday was dead. But Kylorin was also finished with war. The only battle he fought in the Patrian civil war after that was against Henri Ghouls, who Kylorin wouldn't kill.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After Asmoday's death his followers entombed his corpse on the Isle of Scorpions. The isle was once green and full of life but after burying Asmoday there, all life died or fled and the isle itself started slipping into the sea. A few decades after his burial a shipwreck occurred nearby and the survivors swam to the island. It would have been better for them to die at sea. They quickly turned on each other and within a few days they were all dead. Sometimes their spirits can still be seen wandering the island, especially during storms.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After his death the Daughters of Saleos summoned the soul of Asmoday and bound it to a skull carved from a Zabulus horn. It is known as the Skull of Asmoday and it is their most prized relic and a powerful source of entropy magic.</English>
