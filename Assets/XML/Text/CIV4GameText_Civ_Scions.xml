Released from the Second Vault, the so-called "Bottomless Tomb," the Scions promise to restore the glory of Patria:  They will drive out the jealous warring angels and set humankind as the rulers of Erebus.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Scions have already conquered disease, infirmity, and even death.  Or perhaps they have been conquered by death.  What they are, exactly, is disputed even among the wise.  They do not seem to be the mindless horrors one expects of the undead.  But in a world of magic seeming often means very little.  That those living in the harsh Age of Rebirth find the promises seductive is, however, all too clear.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Risen Emperor intends to rule all Erebus.

Skull-like visages, headless spearmen, and bodies of perfect darkness clothed in bright armor are among the horrors her enemies must face.[PARAGRAPH:1]While the Emperor rules directly the Scions will worship no other God.

It's a word fraught with traps laid by your Hierarchs, good sir. Look about you, believe your own eyes. Is not this, the city of Scions, cleaner and stronger than your own? Our magics, our knowledge, that of Patria reborn, gives us buildings of gilt marble and metals where you have wood and base granite. To be one of us you need only give up your desperate animal hungers, your diseases, your fear of death. You have heard the tales, and they are all true.

		<French>[TAB]Je briserai la porte de l'Enfer, et détruirai les verrous ;[PARAGRAPH:1]J'emmènerai les morts partager le repas des vivants,[PARAGRAPH:1]et les vivants seront débordés par leur nombre.[PARAGRAPH:1][TAB]Le Récit de Gilgamesh[PARAGRAPH:2]Les scions de Patria prétendent être les princes renaissants de l'empire le plus fier qu'Erebus ait jamais connu. Issus de Second Caveau, aussi nommé la "Tombe sans Fond," les scions promettent de restaurer la gloire de Patria : ils expluseront d'Erebus les anges belligérants et imposeront l'humanité comme dirigeant Erebus.[PARAGRAPH:1]Les scions ont déjà vaincu la maladie, l'infirmité et même la mort. Ou peut-être ont-ils été vaincus par la mort. Leur vraie nature est sujet à discussion même parmi les sages. Ils ne semblent pas être les horreurs sans-âme qu'ont pourrait imaginer des morts-vivants. Mais dans un monde de magie les apparences sont souvent trompeuses. Que ceux qui vivent au cruel Âge de la Renaissance trouvent la promesse attractive est cependant bien trop clair.[PARAGRAPH:1]L'Empereur Ressuscité compte régner sur tout Erebus. De quel type de détente profite-t-il, s'il se détend jamais, personne ne le sait.[PARAGRAPH:1]Au sein des villes scionnes l'immense majorité des habitants sont morts, et la plupart apprécient le Don de l'Empereur au maximum. Des trésors de l'Âge de la Renaissance affluent dans les villes scionnes pour satisfaire les appétits et les désirs de gens comptant vivre une vie éternelle de confort et de luxure.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alors que la plupart des scions sont fiers de leur chair pure et sans-défaut, les militaires scions profitent au maximum de sa malléabilité. En général, les scions sont très beaux, possédant à minima une apparence de santé parfaite. Mais les soldats de Patria Ressuscitée sont terrifiants. Visages à l'apparence de crânes, lanciers sans-tête, et des corps d'un noir de jais vêtus d'armures brillantes font partie des horreurs que leurs ennemis doivent affronter.[PARAGRAPH:1]Tant que l'Empereur rêgne directement les scions ne vénèreront aucun autre dieu. Des scènes extrêmes de sacrifice et de dévotion ne sont pas rares en présence de l'Empereur. De nombreux martyrs de Patria, par exemple, furent un jour ses employés directs. L'apparat semi-officiel du Culte Impérial est facilement aussi grand que celui de l'Église du Don. Au sein de chaque ville de Patria Ressuscitée, la quête du plaisir éternel, l'appel de la dévoltion éternelle, et la menace de l'existence éternelle se disputent l'âme et l'esprit de chaque scion.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Mort-vivant ? C'est un mot empli de pièges mis en place par vos Hiérarques, mon bon monsieur. Regardez-vous, croyez en ce que voient vos yeux. Cette ville, celle des scions, n'est-elle pas plus propre et plus forte que les vôtres ? Nos magies, notre savoir, ceux de Patria Ressuscitée, rendent possible des bâtiments de marbre et de métaux dorés tout en étant de bois et de granit brut. Pour être l'un d'entre nous, il vous suffit d'abandonner vos appétits d'animaux désespérés, vos maladies, votre peur de la mort. Vous avez entendu les récits, et ils sont tous vrais. Nous avons besoin de peu, notre chair est imputrescible, nos outils variés et puissants. Joignez vous à nous, et votre vie, pardon, votre existence éternelle sera faite de confort et de délices.[PARAGRAPH:1]Vos prières vers Junil, vous l'avez vu, sont vaines. Ce vieil homme, s'il s'en est jamais soucié (et s'il a jamais existé) ne peut pas vous aider. Nous... vous avez entendu les récits et ils sont vrais. Mais ils ne racontent pas tout. Nos plaisirs sont à la fois variés et raffinés. Les Auspices arriveront bientôt avec les courroies et les outils d'embaumement et ces plaisirs, mon bon monsieur, je vous les montrerai."</French>

Uscendo dalla Seconda Cripta, la cosidetta "Tomba senza Fondo", gli Eredi promettono di ripristinare la gloria di Patria: Scacceranno gli angeli invidiosi e renderanno l'umanità padrona di Erebus.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gli Eredi hanno già sconfitto malattie, infermità, e persino la morte. O forse sono stati loro ad essere sconfitti dalla morte. La loro vera natura è dibattuta anche tra i saggi. Non sembrano essere gli orrori senza cervello che ci aspetta per non morti. Ma in un mondo con la magia l'apparenza conta poco. È chiaro invece che, durante la difficile Era della Rinascita, i viventi trovano le loro promesse molto attraenti.[PARAGRAPH:1]L'Imperatore Risorto intende governare su tutto Erebus. Quali compromessi sarà disposto ad accettare, se mai lo farà, nessuno lo sa.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nelle città degli Eredi i morti sono la stragrande maggioranza, e la maggior parte di loro intende godersi appieno il Dono dell'Imperatore. I tesori dell?era della Rinascita confluiscono nelle città degli Eredi per saziare gli appetiti e i desideri di un popolo dedito a una vita eterna di agio e lusso.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mentre la maggior parte degli Eredi è orgogliosa della bellezza dei loro corpi eterni e perfetti le loro forze armate ne sfruttano appieno la malleabilità. In generale gli Eredi sono molto belli, avendo all'apparenza una salute perfetta. Invece i soldati di Patria Rinata sono terrificanti. Volti simili a teschi, lancieri senza testa, e corpi di perfetta oscurità coperti da armature brillanti sono lacuni degli orrori che i loro nemici devono affrontare.[PARAGRAPH:1]Quando l'Imperatore governa in maniera diretta gli Eredi non venererannò nessun altro dio. Esibizioni estreme di sacrificio e devozione sono frequenti in seguito all'esposizione alla presenza dell'Imperatore. Molti Martiri di Patria, per esempio, erano una volta i suoi assistenti personali. Il semi ufficiale Apparato del Culto Imperiale è simile in dimensione alla Chiesa del Dono. In ogni città di Patria Rinata la ricerca del piacere eterno, il richiamo della devozione eterna, e la minaccia di un'esistenza eterna competono per l'anima e la mente di ogni Erede.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Non morto?" È una parola piena di insidie poste dai tuoi Gerarchi, buon signore. Guardati intorno, guarda coi tuoi occhi. Non è forse questa città degli Eredi più pulità e più forte delle tue? Le nostre magie, la nostra conoscenza, quella di Patria Rinata, ci regala edifici di marmo dorato e metalli dove tu hai invece legno e granito. Per essere uno di noi devi solo rinunciare ai tuoi disperati appetiti animaleschi, le tue malattie, la tua paura della morte. Hai sentito le storie, e sono tutte vere. I nostri bisogni sono pochi, la nostra carne imperitura, i nostri strumenti sono vari e potenti. Unisciti a noi e la tua vita, chiedo perdono, la tua esistenza eterna, sarà una di agio e lusso."[PARAGRAPH:1]Le vostre suppliche a Junil, avrete ormai notato, sono inutili. Quel vecchio, se mai gli importa e se mai esiste, non puo aiutarvi. Di noi invece... avete sentito le storie, e sono vere. Ma non raccontano tutto. I nostri piaceri sono altrettanto vari e raffinati. L'Auspix ariverà a momenti con le cinghie e gli strumenti da imbalsamazione e quei piacieri, buon signore, ve li mostrerò."</Italian>

		<English>The greatest difference between the Scions and the other civs is how the Scions use population, and how they gain it.[PARAGRAPH:1]As a Fallow civilization the Scions don't need to allocate any of a city's population to gathering food. This means that, given the same population as another civ, Scion cities are far more productive. However, as a Fallow civilization the Scions cannot gain population via food and normal growth. Instead they must lure Awakened from the Bottomless Tomb, create Reborn, or capture cities, though most people tend to leave a city captured by the Scions.</English>
		<French>La plus grande différence entre les scions et les autres civilisations réside dans leur usage de la population et leur façon de l'accroître.[PARAGRAPH:1] En tant que civilsation En Friche, les scions n'ont besoin de personne à la production de nourriture. Grâce à ça, pour la même population qu'une autre ville, les villes scionnes sont bien plus productives. Cependant, en tant que civilisation En Friche, les scions ne peuvent accroître leur population via la nourriture et la croissance normale. Au lieu de ça, ils doivent leurrer les Éveillés de la Tombe Sans Fin, créer des Ressuscités ou capturer des villes.</French>

		<English>Living yet immortal guardian of the Sleeping Emperor, and by extension all Scions of Patria.  She hopes for eventual release the Sleeping Emperor.  Once Risen, the Emperor will allow Korinna to act as his Regent and, always his people's Hero, go forth to destroy the Scions enemies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_1]Part 1: In a Bright Land[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_2]Part 2: In a Bright Land[\LINK][NEWLINE]Part 3: In a Bright Land[NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_4]Part 4: In a Bright Land[\LINK][NEWLINE]	In a bright land, under a bright sky, Korinna watched the mammoth herd.  She wore fur and hide clothes she'd made herself, bound up with homemade leather, a stone knife at her waist.  Hair streaming in the wind, she smiled at the way the huge beasts rumbled across the plain below her.  It was good to see something moving, perhaps even thriving, in this frozen waste.  The ash under her eyes cut the glare to something bearable, but even the glare was better than the alternating gloom and dark that marked the week-long blizzards.
			From the dreaming dead she knew winter.  But she'd also expected to see something of the other seasons, too.  No.  The whole world, so far as she knew, was covered with snow and ice.  She wasn't sure how much longer she could keep moving.  If the food and fuel ran out... she knew she wouldn't die.  Not from mere deprivation.  But to be trapped here, wasted and frozen, would to be in hell.  She'd throw herself off a cliff first.
			It had started so promisingly.  A great adventure away from mother and father.  She would see the living world that had born her father when he was of it, and that mother helped guard.  Her mother told Korinna that while the dreams could teach her much they could never teach her everything.  They were the interpreted world, not the experienced world.  Other people's interpretations, never her experience.  The odd hiding angel, Rahserat... she would help him enter Erebus, and then he'd be her guide there.  She was to obey him.  And she would, if she ever found him.  
			Where was he?
			With new traveling gear lifted from the dreaming of an adventuring Queen, Korinna had taken one of her secret uncle's routes from the underworld.  (Secret because he didn't know she was his niece.)  Stepping into Erebus was amazing.  There was air, and ground, and light in the underworld.  Of course.  But it wasn't the same as the air or earth or light of Erebus.  She really did feel closer to the One.  Or perhaps just not as oppressed by Arawn's shadow.
			And her journey to the Ivory Gate had been a revelation.  It was also long and arduous.  The snow had been the worst.  She hadn't figured out how to make hide and sinew snowshoes yet.  She hadn't figured out almost everything, yet.  The cold was the most incredible thing.  Dreamed cold was never, ever, half as painful, half as stinging, half as pervasive.  Cold was not something that really existed in the dreamlands, except as a pale imitation.
			But she had made it to the Ivory Gate, eventually.  Low on food, exhausted, she'd been looking forward to seeing Rahserat again.  Both for the company and because she knew an angel's power would be of immense help in the wilderness.  She'd climbed among the foothills and, guided by her mother's directions, found the Gate.  She'd taken the Gate's handle in hand and pulled.  If Rahserat was on the other side, it would open.  But it hadn't opened.  
			She'd arrived on the appointed day, and so she'd hauled on the gate all that day.  Her hands were continually sliced by the odd barbs in the ivory, but he never came.  No angel.  No company.  No help.
			That had been long ago.  She watched the stars whenever visible.  She kept careful records on the rock beside the gate when storms hid the stars.  On the appointed day she tried the Gate every year, and every year it did not open.
			Korinna made a home of a deep cave a day's journey from the Gate.   The great bear that had preceded her as owner furnished her with her first set of new clothes.  Now she sometimes worried that she'd hunt the hills bare of large game.  She recorded the courses of the stars, but she avoided recording the passage of years.  She didn't want to know how long she waited.  Had she been abandoned?
			She'd avoided men for decades.  Then loneliness had set in and she'd realized they could be company, of a sort.  Where before they had hunted her, having seen the smoke from her fires, she hunted them.  When she found a lone hunter she'd kill him, but first give him a message to pass to her mother.  The earliest ones, of course, she'd had teach her their language.  Korinna couldn't trust them to carry a message unless they repeated it back it her in their own tongue.  Twice she descended to the villages to seek an auger.  What she was told was hopeful, but the terrified, addled woman had made no sense.
			There were no seasons of note in the icy wasteland, and soon her life had taken on a timeless quality.  She hunted, she collected dung for fires or, occasionally, wood.  But she didn't like to go far from the Gate.  She composed long messages to her mother and dispatched them, along with a luckless  tribesman, at intervals.   When her clothes wore out she'd make new ones, or use those of a fallen tribesman.  She watched the animals, sometimes hunting just to observe, not kill.  And that was the scope of her days, of her life.  She slept through the nights and the storms and walked under the sky only when the sun was clear and shining.  In her bright land the centuries passed without mark.
			Until one year, on Gate day, both handles had come away in her hand.  She'd hauled on them just as the sun rose and the whole elaborate cross-piece had snapped off, putting a deep cut in her right hand.  She looked at the ivory in horror.  The occasional day of bright sun and relative warmth had, over a great span, caused it to corrode and crumble.  She'd never really known anger, or despair, until that day.
			She'd gone mad for a time.  She'd killed every man within a day's journey, saying terrible things to her mother.  She'd cursed her father, the faithless Rahserat, and the One.  She'd stopped eating and nearly froze before appetite overcame her.  She hadn't known it but she'd never really been hungry before, either.  She almost sent herself to her mother, but to do so would be to admit defeat.  
			Even after her black time she'd been bleak.  Perhaps for years, she didn't know.  But one day well after the tribes had returned, she had an idea.  Maybe the first new one in centuries.  
			She could repair the Gate.  She didn't know what magic might support it, and she'd never thought about where the Gate had come from, or who'd made it.  She just assumed it was something beyond time, incorruptible.  But not, at least, the physical form.  And that she could repair.  Her hands were wise now, after mortal lifetimes of craft, and there was plenty of ivory to be had.  The Gate... she could put it right.  She would.  
			And she did.  With a long, stone-tipped spear and as many knives as she could easily carry, she stalked and killed a great mammoth each year.   Harvesting the beast for fur, ivory, and a little leather, she'd carve and fit, taking the most time over the Gate's uncanny barbs, and shedding much blood.  It became part of the annual, futile ritual that was the only punctuation to her bright, changeless days. 
			Where was he?
			Rahserat had left the underworld feeling better than he had for ages.  Gyra, for reasons he couldn't fathom, was a unanticipated ally.  She hadn't helped him directly with his mission, true, but she still aided him in undermining Arawn, and she'd almost certainly make a better ally for his Lord than Laroth.  If nothing else he could return early and report these fortuitous events to Esus.  His Lord would know what to make of them.  But the angel's mood had dissolved as soon as he stepped into the Hidden Queen's passageway en route for the Ivory Gate.  It was not like last time.  Instead it was far darker, and shot through with red lights that clung to the edge  and only the edge  of vision.  Rahserat took a cautious step to the left, along the wall, and found himself instead moving somehow downwards.  Another step, and the passage became even darker, and he moved further downwards.  He tried to step upwards then, climb back, but the passage abruptly became pitch-black even to his vision, and the movement downward accelerated.  And did not stop.  Not for years.
			When he found himself again he was crawling across a gray stone floor toward a great stone chair.  A greenish light came into the chamber through a collapsed section of wall, along with a weird and terrible smell.  It was something like rot, something like the musk of a great beast, or a city.  It never faded.  Not over the weeks in which he crawled, or all the time in the chair itself.
			When he found himself seated in the chair, slowly turning to stone, the Hidden Queen finally spoke.  She had been watching him crawl, he realized now.  She castigated him for his betrayal, for never sending her the word she sought.
			Hadn't he?  He thought he'd had.  He'd broken his Lord's vial as soon as he'd arrived.  While the Queen gloated of traps and of deities, of bait, and of snares for the One, he thought about the vial and his Lord.  Had his Lord betrayed him?  Had the vial done anything at all?  The Hidden Queen couldn't be a comfortable ally.  His Lord might have lied.  That was his precept.  But then, the Hidden Queen could be lying too.  Or maybe his Lord had kept a secret, even if that was her precept.  Perhaps he'd wanted the Queen angered at Rahserat, but not able to reach him.  He, Rahserat, and broken from his Lord's thought by leaving the underworld much earlier than planned.  This eldritch prison, this bizarre torture, might be the result of his own good intentions.
			By the time he'd thought it through, perhaps taking years, the Hidden Queen was gone.  She'd said something about the end of creation.  Was that where he was?  The light had gone for a time, he thought, but it was back now.  He could see that a stone chair across from him had eyes, and was slowly turning into a man.  Not him.  The shadows stirred and giggled.  Their thoughts stabbed at him.
			His clothes had awakened from their slumber and left through the hole in the wall.  He could hear them screaming as something caught and ate them.  When the light turned to darkness this time he noticed that the shadows were unchanged in their dance.  He realized it hadn't turned to darkness so much that the darkness had become light.  Everything blurred here.  His thoughts into blood, light into darkness, the living into the unliving.  And the reverse, in everything.  Blood to thought.  Dark to light.  The unliving to the living.
			Souls sent by the false Laroth, sent not to a location but bound instead to him, began arriving.  He hid them in the stone.  They began their own changes, but slowly, as slowly as he could bend time.  Time was just breath, after all.  As the shadows mocked him he began to understand.  One thing wasn't becoming another.  No, all things were one thing here.  Unified.  If creation was endless variety this place was the end of creation.  Everything blurred together.  Why the One might be here, the Rahserats couldn't say.  Maybe when everything was one, they became the One?  Whether that was a semantic trick or a deep truth the Queen might be able to say, but they couldn't.
			The shadows having been consumed, the Rahserats pulled themselves back together.  He was stronger now, stronger than ever before, but stranger.  He thought he might be an archangel now.  He felt that powerful.  But whose archangel?
			With the predatory shadows gone space itself grew, and grew.  The chamber still had its break in the wall somewhere, but it was lost and tiny now.  The immense place was full of darkness, and stone.    Or things that were often darkness and stone.  That was the tendency, at least for now.  And now the souls were legion, but still placed in stone for relative safety.  There they lost themselves in dreams far more peculiar than they'd known before.  The darkness ate at Rahserat sometimes, and he writhed and ate at it.  Maybe the Queen hoped the One would come to save a poor trapped angel.  But he doubted it.
			Rahserat started skipping around in time.  Perhaps rather than becoming the One, this place was the antithesis of the One.  Where the One was existence, everything becoming the same as everything else was the most final sort of non-existence.  If everything existed as one  or One - there could, eventually, be no change.  And no new creation, for everything already existed.  Maybe the One would have to come here to destroy it.  Would Rahserat defend this place, this end of creation?  He might.
			But eventually he found a time when the darkness sounded like Korinna singing.  The souls in the stones actually noticed it first.  The singing came not from beyond the break in the wall.  He knew he could never go outside.  Must not.  But he didn't have to.  The singing came from a point of red.
			He ate the red.  Just the color, it was one he hadn't seen in awhile.  The point remained.   More points appeared, stains, and he ate the red in them too.  Skipping again, he found a time when a red door stood before him.  Rather than eating it, he asked his arms to push it.  They did.
			Korinna fell away as the door broke again, and cursed.  She'd thought she wouldn't have to renew the handles for three or four mammoths.  A man had somehow appeared on the snow between her and the Ivory Gate, and the Gate was a bottomless darkness rather than blooded ivory.  She blinked at the scene without comprehension for several moments before finally understanding.  The Gate was open!  He'd come!
			Or was this Rahserat?  He was shriveled, shrunken.  She turned him over and the blood from her hands soaked immediately into his skin and disappeared.  Then the snow under him did, too, and he was limned in darkness for a moment, apparently absorbing the light.  He stretched and grew, withered flesh replaced with smooth skin over dense muscle.  Korinna steadied herself as the hill seemed to tilt and Rahserat grew... not brighter, but everything else seemed to fade to background.  But at last he become the Rahserat she dimly remembered.  Then he opened his eyes.  They weren't what she remembered.

		<French>Living yet immortal guardian of the Sleeping Emperor, and by extension all Scions of Patria.  She hopes for eventual release the Sleeping Emperor.  Once Risen, the Emperor will allow Korinna to act as his Regent and, always his people's Hero, go forth to destroy the Scions enemies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_1]Part 1: In a Bright Land[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_2]Part 2: In a Bright Land[\LINK][NEWLINE]Part 3: In a Bright Land[NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_4]Part 4: In a Bright Land[\LINK][NEWLINE]	In a bright land, under a bright sky, Korinna watched the mammoth herd.  She wore fur and hide clothes she'd made herself, bound up with homemade leather, a stone knife at her waist.  Hair streaming in the wind, she smiled at the way the huge beasts rumbled across the plain below her.  It was good to see something moving, perhaps even thriving, in this frozen waste.  The ash under her eyes cut the glare to something bearable, but even the glare was better than the alternating gloom and dark that marked the week-long blizzards.
			From the dreaming dead she knew winter.  But she'd also expected to see something of the other seasons, too.  No.  The whole world, so far as she knew, was covered with snow and ice.  She wasn't sure how much longer she could keep moving.  If the food and fuel ran out... she knew she wouldn't die.  Not from mere deprivation.  But to be trapped here, wasted and frozen, would to be in hell.  She'd throw herself off a cliff first.
			It had started so promisingly.  A great adventure away from mother and father.  She would see the living world that had born her father when he was of it, and that mother helped guard.  Her mother told Korinna that while the dreams could teach her much they could never teach her everything.  They were the interpreted world, not the experienced world.  Other people's interpretations, never her experience.  The odd hiding angel, Rahserat... she would help him enter Erebus, and then he'd be her guide there.  She was to obey him.  And she would, if she ever found him.  
			Where was he?
			With new traveling gear lifted from the dreaming of an adventuring Queen, Korinna had taken one of her secret uncle's routes from the underworld.  (Secret because he didn't know she was his niece.)  Stepping into Erebus was amazing.  There was air, and ground, and light in the underworld.  Of course.  But it wasn't the same as the air or earth or light of Erebus.  She really did feel closer to the One.  Or perhaps just not as oppressed by Arawn's shadow.
			And her journey to the Ivory Gate had been a revelation.  It was also long and arduous.  The snow had been the worst.  She hadn't figured out how to make hide and sinew snowshoes yet.  She hadn't figured out almost everything, yet.  The cold was the most incredible thing.  Dreamed cold was never, ever, half as painful, half as stinging, half as pervasive.  Cold was not something that really existed in the dreamlands, except as a pale imitation.
			But she had made it to the Ivory Gate, eventually.  Low on food, exhausted, she'd been looking forward to seeing Rahserat again.  Both for the company and because she knew an angel's power would be of immense help in the wilderness.  She'd climbed among the foothills and, guided by her mother's directions, found the Gate.  She'd taken the Gate's handle in hand and pulled.  If Rahserat was on the other side, it would open.  But it hadn't opened.  
			She'd arrived on the appointed day, and so she'd hauled on the gate all that day.  Her hands were continually sliced by the odd barbs in the ivory, but he never came.  No angel.  No company.  No help.
			That had been long ago.  She watched the stars whenever visible.  She kept careful records on the rock beside the gate when storms hid the stars.  On the appointed day she tried the Gate every year, and every year it did not open.
			Korinna made a home of a deep cave a day's journey from the Gate.   The great bear that had preceded her as owner furnished her with her first set of new clothes.  Now she sometimes worried that she'd hunt the hills bare of large game.  She recorded the courses of the stars, but she avoided recording the passage of years.  She didn't want to know how long she waited.  Had she been abandoned?
			She'd avoided men for decades.  Then loneliness had set in and she'd realized they could be company, of a sort.  Where before they had hunted her, having seen the smoke from her fires, she hunted them.  When she found a lone hunter she'd kill him, but first give him a message to pass to her mother.  The earliest ones, of course, she'd had teach her their language.  Korinna couldn't trust them to carry a message unless they repeated it back it her in their own tongue.  Twice she descended to the villages to seek an auger.  What she was told was hopeful, but the terrified, addled woman had made no sense.
			There were no seasons of note in the icy wasteland, and soon her life had taken on a timeless quality.  She hunted, she collected dung for fires or, occasionally, wood.  But she didn't like to go far from the Gate.  She composed long messages to her mother and dispatched them, along with a luckless  tribesman, at intervals.   When her clothes wore out she'd make new ones, or use those of a fallen tribesman.  She watched the animals, sometimes hunting just to observe, not kill.  And that was the scope of her days, of her life.  She slept through the nights and the storms and walked under the sky only when the sun was clear and shining.  In her bright land the centuries passed without mark.
			Until one year, on Gate day, both handles had come away in her hand.  She'd hauled on them just as the sun rose and the whole elaborate cross-piece had snapped off, putting a deep cut in her right hand.  She looked at the ivory in horror.  The occasional day of bright sun and relative warmth had, over a great span, caused it to corrode and crumble.  She'd never really known anger, or despair, until that day.
			She'd gone mad for a time.  She'd killed every man within a day's journey, saying terrible things to her mother.  She'd cursed her father, the faithless Rahserat, and the One.  She'd stopped eating and nearly froze before appetite overcame her.  She hadn't known it but she'd never really been hungry before, either.  She almost sent herself to her mother, but to do so would be to admit defeat.  
			Even after her black time she'd been bleak.  Perhaps for years, she didn't know.  But one day well after the tribes had returned, she had an idea.  Maybe the first new one in centuries.  
			She could repair the Gate.  She didn't know what magic might support it, and she'd never thought about where the Gate had come from, or who'd made it.  She just assumed it was something beyond time, incorruptible.  But not, at least, the physical form.  And that she could repair.  Her hands were wise now, after mortal lifetimes of craft, and there was plenty of ivory to be had.  The Gate... she could put it right.  She would.  
			And she did.  With a long, stone-tipped spear and as many knives as she could easily carry, she stalked and killed a great mammoth each year.   Harvesting the beast for fur, ivory, and a little leather, she'd carve and fit, taking the most time over the Gate's uncanny barbs, and shedding much blood.  It became part of the annual, futile ritual that was the only punctuation to her bright, changeless days. 
			Where was he?
			Rahserat had left the underworld feeling better than he had for ages.  Gyra, for reasons he couldn't fathom, was a unanticipated ally.  She hadn't helped him directly with his mission, true, but she still aided him in undermining Arawn, and she'd almost certainly make a better ally for his Lord than Laroth.  If nothing else he could return early and report these fortuitous events to Esus.  His Lord would know what to make of them.  But the angel's mood had dissolved as soon as he stepped into the Hidden Queen's passageway en route for the Ivory Gate.  It was not like last time.  Instead it was far darker, and shot through with red lights that clung to the edge  and only the edge  of vision.  Rahserat took a cautious step to the left, along the wall, and found himself instead moving somehow downwards.  Another step, and the passage became even darker, and he moved further downwards.  He tried to step upwards then, climb back, but the passage abruptly became pitch-black even to his vision, and the movement downward accelerated.  And did not stop.  Not for years.

Why the One might be here, the Rahserats couldn't say.  Maybe when everything was one, they became the One?  Whether that was a semantic trick or a deep truth the Queen might be able to say, but they couldn't.
			The shadows having been consumed, the Rahserats pulled themselves back together.  He was stronger now, stronger than ever before, but stranger.  He thought he might be an archangel now.  He felt that powerful.  But whose archangel?
			With the predatory shadows gone space itself grew, and grew.  The chamber still had its break in the wall somewhere, but it was lost and tiny now.  The immense place was full of darkness, and stone.    Or things that were often darkness and stone.  That was the tendency, at least for now.  And now the souls were legion, but still placed in stone for relative safety.  There they lost themselves in dreams far more peculiar than they'd known before.  The darkness ate at Rahserat sometimes, and he writhed and ate at it.  Maybe the Queen hoped the One would come to save a poor trapped angel.  But he doubted it.
			Rahserat started skipping around in time.  Perhaps rather than becoming the One, this place was the antithesis of the One.  Where the One was existence, everything becoming the same as everything else was the most final sort of non-existence.  If everything existed as one  or One - there could, eventually, be no change.  And no new creation, for everything already existed.  Maybe the One would have to come here to destroy it.  Would Rahserat defend this place, this end of creation?  He might.
			But eventually he found a time when the darkness sounded like Korinna singing.  The souls in the stones actually noticed it first.  The singing came not from beyond the break in the wall.  He knew he could never go outside.  Must not.  But he didn't have to.  The singing came from a point of red.
			He ate the red.  Just the color, it was one he hadn't seen in awhile.  The point remained.   More points appeared, stains, and he ate the red in them too.  Skipping again, he found a time when a red door stood before him.  Rather than eating it, he asked his arms to push it.  They did.
			Korinna fell away as the door broke again, and cursed.  She'd thought she wouldn't have to renew the handles for three or four mammoths.  A man had somehow appeared on the snow between her and the Ivory Gate, and the Gate was a bottomless darkness rather than blooded ivory.  She blinked at the scene without comprehension for several moments before finally understanding.  The Gate was open!  He'd come!
			Or was this Rahserat?  He was shriveled, shrunken.  She turned him over and the blood from her hands soaked immediately into his skin and disappeared.  Then the snow under him did, too, and he was limned in darkness for a moment, apparently absorbing the light.  He stretched and grew, withered flesh replaced with smooth skin over dense muscle.  Korinna steadied herself as the hill seemed to tilt and Rahserat grew... not brighter, but everything else seemed to fade to background.  But at last he become the Rahserat she dimly remembered.  Then he opened his eyes.  They weren't what she remembered.</German>
		<Italian>Guardiana vivente ma immortale dell'Imperatore Dormiente, e per estensione di tutti gli Eredi di Patria. Spera nell'arrivo dell'Imperatore Dormiente. Una volta Risorto, l'Imperatore permetterà a Korinna di agire come suo reggente e, essendo l'Eroina del suo popolo, di distruggere i nemici degli Eredi.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_1]Parte 1: In una Terra Luminosa[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_2]Parte 2: In una Terra Luminosa[\LINK][NEWLINE]Parte 3: In una Terra Luminosa[NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_4]Parte 4: In una Terra Luminosa[\LINK][NEWLINE]In una terra luminosa, sotto un cielo brillante, Korinna osservava una mandria di mammut. Indossava vestiti di pelle e pelliccia che si era fatta da sola, legati con lacci di cuoio fatti a mano, e un coltello di pietra in vita. Con i capelli sciolti al vento sorrise nel vedere i movimenti lenti di quelle enormi bestie nella pianura sottostante. Era bello vedere qualcosa muoversi, forse perfino prosperare, in questa landa ghiacciata. La cenere sotto i suoi occhi rendeva il riflesso sopportabile, ma anche cosi non fosse stato era sempre meglio dell'oscurità portata da bufere di neve che duravano settimane.
			Aveva conosciuto l'inverno dai morti che sognavano. Ma si aspettava di vedere anche qualcosa delle altre stagioni. No. Il mondo intero, per quanto ne sapeva, era coperto da neve e ghiaccio. Non sapeva per quanto ancora avrebbe potuto muoversi. Se il cibo e il combustibile fossero finiti... sapeva che non sarebbe morta. Non di stenti. Ma il rimanere intrappolata qui, emaciata e congelata, sarebbe come l'inferno. Si sarebbe lanciata da un dirupo prima che ciò accadesse.
			Tutto era iniziato in maniera cosi promettente. Una grande avventura lontano dalla madre e dal padre. Avrebbe visto il mondo dei vivi in cui era nato il padre, quando ancore ne faceva parte, e che la madre aiutava a custodire. Sua madre gli aveva detto che sebbene i sogni potevano insegnargli molto non potevano insegnargli tutto. Essi erano un'interpretazione del mondo, non quello reale. L'interpretazione di altre persone, mai la sua.  Lo strano angelo furtivo, Rahserat... lei l'avrebbe aiutato ad entrare in Erebus, e poi lui gli avrebbe fatto da guida. Lei doveva obbedirgli. E lo avrebbe fatto, se mai lo avesse trovato.  
			Ma lui dove era?
			Con una nuova attrezzatura da viaggio presa da una regina avventurosa, Korinna prese una delle strade del suo zio segreto per uscire dall'oltretomba. (Segreto perche lui non sapeva che lei fosse sua nipote). Entrare in Erebus fù fantastico. Vi era aria, e terra, e luce nell'oltretomba. Ovviamente. Ma non erano lo stesso tipo aria o terra o luce di Erebus. Si sentiva davvero più vicina all'Unico. O forse era solo che non si sentiva oppressa dall'ombra di Arawn.
			E il suo viaggio verso la Porta d'Avorio era stato una rivelazione. Fù anche lungo e arduo. La neve era la cosa peggiore. Non aveva ancora trovato il modo di fare delle racchette da neve con pelle e tendine. Non aveva ancora compreso molte cose. Il freddo era la cosa più incredibile. Il freddo sognato era mai stato tanto doloroso, pungente e pervasivo. Il freddo non era qualcosa che esisteva veramente nelle lande del sogno, vi era solo una sua pallida imitazione.
			Ma infine raggiunse la Porta d'Avorio. Con poco cibo ed esausta, non vedeva l'ora di rivedere Rahserat. Sia per la sua compagnia sia perché sapeva che i poteri dell'angelo sarebbero stati di di immenso aiuto nelle terre selvagge. Si arrampicò sulle colline e, seguendo le indicazioni della madre, trovò la Porta. Prese la maniglia della Porta e tirò. Se Rahserat era dall'altra parte si sarebbe aperta. Ma non si aprì.  
			Era arrivata il giorno stabilito, pertanto aveva tirato la porta per tutto il giorno. Le sue mani venivano continuamente tagliate dagli strani barbigli sull'avorio, ma lui non arrivò. Niente angelo. Niente compagnia. Niente aiuto.
			Cio avvenne molto tempo fa. Lei osservava le stelle ogni volta che erano visibili. Faceva in modo di ricordarsi quali pietre stavano vicino alla porta per quando le tempeste nascondevano le stelle. Ogni anno, nel giorno stabilito, provava ad aprire la Porta, e goni anno rimaneva chiusa.
			Korinna si stabilì in una caverna profonda a un giorno di distanza dalla Porta. Il grande orso che ci abitava prima che arrivasse lei era diventato i suoi nuovi vestiti. Alle volte si preoccupava di aver cacciato sino all'estinzione gli animali nelle colline. Aveva tenuto traccia dei passaggi delle stelle, ma aveva evitato di tenere traccia del passare degli anni. Non voleva sapere quanto a lungo stava aspettando. Era forse stata abbandonata?
			Aveva evitato gli uomini per decenni. Ma poi la solitudine arrivò e realizzò che potevano essere di una certa compagnia. Mentre prima erano loro a dargli la caccia, avendo visto il fumo dei suoi fuochi, ora era lei a dare la caccia a loro. Quando trovava un cacciatore solitario lo uccideva, ma prima gli dava un messaggio per la madre. Naturalmente i primi gli dovettero anche insgenare la loro lingua. Korinna non poteva confidare in loro nel trasmettere il messaggio fino a quando non glielo ripetevano nella loro lingua. Due volte ando nei villaggi per cercare un augure. Ciò che gli venne detto gli diede speranza, anche se la donna, terrorizzata e confusa, non riusciva a dire cose sensate.
			Non vi erano cambiamenti degni di nota nelle terre ghiacciate, e a breve la sua vità divenne estremamente monotona. Cacciava, raccoglieva sterco di animale o, occasionalmente, legna per il fuoco. Ma non le piaceva allontanarsi dalla Porta. Componeva lunghi messaggi per la madre, e li spediva insieme a un cacciatore sfortunato ad intervalli regolari. Quando i suoi vestiti si consumavano se ne creava di nuovi, o usava quelli di chi uccideva. E osservava gli animali, non necessariamente per ucciderli. Questo è quello che faceva durante le giornate. Dormiva durante le notti e le tempeste e camminava sotto il cielo solo quando il sole splendeva. Nella sua terra luminosa i secoli passarono immutabilmente.
			Sino a quando, un anno, durante il giorno della Porta, entrambe le maniglie si staccarono. Le aveva tirate proprio mentre sorgeva il sole e l'intero elaborato pezzo si era staccato, aprendo un taglio profondo nella sua mano destra. Guardò l'avorio con orrore. L'occasionale giorno di sole splendente e di relativo caldo lo aveva, nel corso di un lungo lasso di tempo, corroso e fatto sgretolare. Lei non aveva mai provato rabbia, o disperazione, sino a quel giorno.
			Caddè preda della pazzia per un periodo di tempo nondefinito. Uccise ogni essere umano presente nel raggio di un giorno di viaggio, dicendo cose terribili a sua madre. Maledì suo padre, il falso Rahserat, e l'Unico. Smise di mangiare e rimase quasi congelata prima di venire vinta dall'appetito. Non lo sapeva, ma lei non era mai stata veramente affamata prima di allora. Si era quasi spedita alla madre, ma farlo sarebbe stato ammettere la sconfitta.  
			Anche dopo il suo periodo nero rimase sconfortata. Forse per anni, non sapeva per certo. Ma un giorno, quando le tribù erano tornate ormai da un pò, gli vennè in mente una nuova un'idea. Forse la prima in diversi secoli.  
			Avrebbe potuto riparare la Porta. Non sapeva quale magia la supportava, e non aveva mai pensato da dove proveniva la Porta, o chi l'avesse creata. Riteneva che fosse qualcosa fuori dal tempo, incorruttibile. Ma diversamente era per la sua forma materiale. E quella poteva ripararla. Le sue mani erano ormai esperte, dopo diverse vite dei mortali passate a creare oggetti, e vi era avorio in abbondanza. La Porta... poteva aggiustarla. 
			E cosi fece. Con una lunga lancia dalla punta di pietra, e quanti più coltelli poteva portare facilmente cacciava ed uccideva un grande mammut ogni anno. Ricavando da esso pelliccia, avorio, e un po di cuoio, intagliando e rifinendo a lungo le spine della Porta, e facendo ciò versando anche molto sangue. Divenne parte del futile rituale annuale, il quale era l'unico evento degno di nota dei suoi immutabili giorni luminosi. 
			Ma lui dove era?
			Rahserat appena lasciato l'oltretomba si sentì molto meglio di quanto si fosse sentito per secoli. Gyra, per ragioni che non riusciva a comprendere, fù un alleato inaspettato. Lei non lo aveva aiutato in maniera diretta nella sua missione, vero, ma lei l'aveva comunque aiutato a indebolire Arawn, e lei sarebbe stata quasi certamente un alleato migliore di Laroth per il suo Signore. Se non altro avrebbe potuto tornare prima e riferire di questi eventi fortuiti ad Esus. Il suo Signore avrebbe saupto cosa fare. Ma l'umore dell'angelo si dissolse appena entrò nel passaggio della Regina Nascosta diretto verso la Porta d'avorio. Non era come l'ultima volta. Questa volta era molto più buio, e attraversato da luci rosse che si aggrappavano al bordo, e solo al bordo, del campo visivo. Rahserat fece un cauto passo a sinistra, lungo il muro, e si ritrovò invece a muoversi in qualche modo verso il basso. Un altro passo, e il passaggio divenne ancora più oscuro, e ancora più verso il basso si mosse. Allora provò a risalire, a tornare indietro, ma il passaggio divenne improvvisamente completamente buoi, persino alla sua vista, e la discesa accellerò. Senza fermarsi, durando anni.
			Quando ebbe di  nuovo cognizione di se si ritrovò strisciando su un pavimento di pietra grigia verso una grande sedia di pietra. Una luce verdastra entrava nella camera attraverso una sezione di muro che era crollata, insieme a uno strano e terribile odore. Era come quello del marciume, simile a quello del muschio di una grande bestia, o di una città. Non se ne andò mai. Non durante le settimane in cui strisciò, ne per tutto il tempo passato sulla sedia.
			Quando si ritrovò seduto sulla sedia, lentamente trasformandosi in pietra, la Regina Nascosta infine parlò. Realizzò he lei lo aveva osservato mentre strisciava. Lo aveva punito per il suo tradimento, per non avergli mai mandato la parola che lei cercava.
			Non lo aveva fatto? Pensava di averlo fatto. Aveva rotto la fiala del suo Signore non appena era arrivato. Mentre la Regina parlava di trappole e divinità, di esche, e di intrappolare l'unico, lui pensò alla fiala e al suo Signore. Il suo Signore l'aveva tradito? Aveva, la fiala, fatto qualcosa? La Regina Nascosta non poteva essere un alleato cofortevole. Il suo Signore poteva aver mentito. Questo era il suo precetto. Ma anche la Regina Nascosta poteva star mentendo. O forse il suo Signore aveva tenuto per se un segreto, anche se quello era il precetto di lei. O forse ancora lui voleva la Regina arrabbiata con Rahserat, ma non in grado di raggiungerlo. Lui, Rahserat, e separato dal pensiero del suo Signore avendo lasciato molto prima di quanto era stato pianificato. Questa strana prigione, questa bizzarra tortura, potevano essere il risultato delle sue buone intenzioni.
			Quando fini di rifletterci su, forse impiegando anni, la Regina Nascosta se ne era già andata via. Lei aveva detto qualcosa riguardo la fine della creazione. Era lì che si trovava? La luce era sparità per un pò, pensò, ma ora era tornata. Poteva vedere che una sedia di pietra di fronte a lui aveva degli occhi, e si stava lentamente trasformando in un uomo. Non lui. Le ombre si agitarono e ridacchiarono. I loro pensieri lo pugnalarono.
			I suoi vestiti si erano risvegliati dal loro sonno e se ne erano andati attraverso il buco nel muro. Li sentiva urlare mentre qualcosa li prendeva e li mangiava. Quando la luce divenne oscurità notò che la danza delle ombre rimase uguale. Comprese che non era diventata cosi oscura che l'oscurità era diventata luce. Tutto diventava sfuocato qui. I suoi pensieri in sangue, luce in oscurità, il vivente nel non vivente. E il contrario, in tutto. Il sangue in pensiero. L'oscurità in luce. Il non vivente nel vivente.
			Anime inviate dal falso Laroth, inviate non in un luogo, ma legate invece a lui, iniziarono ad arrivare. Lui le nascose nella pietra. Loro iniziarono le loro modifiche, ma lentamente, cosi lentamente che lui poteva piegare il tempo. Il tempo era solo un respiro dopotutto. Mentre le ombre lo prendevano in giro iniziò a comprendere. Le cose non stavano diventandone altre. No, tutte le cose erano una sola cosa qui. Unite. Se la creazione era una varietà infinita questo posto era la fine della creazione. Tutto si confondeva insieme. Perché l'Unico avrebbe potuto essere li i Rahserats non ne avevano idea. Forse quando tutto sarebbe stato una sola cosa, sarebbero diventati l'Unico? Se quello era un trucco semantico o la profonda verità la Regina forse poteva saperlo, ma loro non potevano.
			Con le ombre consumate, i Rahserats si riaccorparono. Era più forte ora, più forte che mai, ma diverso. Pensò che poteva essere un arcangelo ora. Si sentiva tanto potente. Ma l'arcangelo di chi?
			Senza le ombre predatrici lo spazio stesso crebbe. La stanza aveva ancora il buco nel muro da qualche parte, ma era perduto e piccolo ora. Il posto immenso era pieno di socurità e pietra. O di cose che erano spesso oscurità e pietra. Quella era la tendeza, almeno per ora. E ora le anime erano legione, ma ancora situate nella pietra per relativa sicurezza. Li si perdevano in sogni molto più particolari di quelli che avevano conosciuto finora. A volte l'oscurità mangiava Rahserat, e lui si contorceva e la mangiava. Forse la Regina sperava che l'Unico sarebbe giunto per salvare un povero angelo intrappolato. Ma ne dubitava.
			Rahserat iniziò a gironzolare col tempo. Forse più che diventare l'Unico, questo posto ne era l'antitesi. Dove l'unico era l'esistenza, ognicosa diventava ogni altra cosa era forma finale di non esistenza. Se ogni cosa esisteva come singolo, o Unico, poteva eventualmente non esserci cambiamento. E nessuna nuova creazione, in quanto tutto già esisteva. Forse l'Unico sarebbe venuto qui per distruggere il luogo. Rahserat avrebbe difeso questo luogo, questa fine della creazione? Avrebbe potuto.
			Ma alla fine trovò un tempo in cui l'oscurità sembrava il canto di Korinna. In realtà furono le anime nella pietra le prime a notarlo. Il canto non proveniva da dietro la breccia nel muro. Lui sapeva che non avrebbe mai potuto andare all'esterno. Non doveva. Non aveva bisogno di farlo. Il canto proveniva da un punto di rosso.
			Lui mangiò il rosso. Solo il colore, era uno che non aveva visto in molto tempo. Il punto rimase. Altri punti apparvero, come macchie, e mangiò il loro rosso. Muovendosi di nuovo trovò un tempo in cui vi era una porta rosso davanti a lui. Piuttosto che mangiarla chiese alle sue braccia di spingerla. E cosi fecero.
			Korinna cadde quando la porta si ruppe di nuovo, e imprecò. Sperava che on avrebbe dovuto rinnovare le maniglie prima di 3 o 4 mammut. Un uomo era, in uqalche modo, apparso tra lei e la Porta d'Avorio, e la Porta appariva come un'oscurità senza fondo anziché come avoirio insanguinato. Osservò la scena senza comprenderla per diversi secondi prima di capire infine cosa era successo. La Porta si era aperta! Lui era arrivato!
			Era lui Rahserat? L'uomo era raggrinzito e rattrappito. Lei lo girò  She turned him over and the blood from her hands soaked immediately into his skin and disappeared.  Then the snow under him did, too, and he was limned in darkness for a moment, apparently absorbing the light.  He stretched and grew, withered flesh replaced with smooth skin over dense muscle.  Korinna steadied herself as the hill seemed to tilt and Rahserat grew... not brighter, but everything else seemed to fade to background.  But at last he become the Rahserat she dimly remembered.  Then he opened his eyes.  They weren't what she remembered.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Living yet immortal guardian of the Sleeping Emperor, and by extension all Scions of Patria.  She hopes for eventual release the Sleeping Emperor.  Once Risen, the Emperor will allow Korinna to act as his Regent and, always his people's Hero, go forth to destroy the Scions enemies.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_1]Part 1: In a Bright Land[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_2]Part 2: In a Bright Land[\LINK][NEWLINE]Part 3: In a Bright Land[NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_4]Part 4: In a Bright Land[\LINK][NEWLINE]	In a bright land, under a bright sky, Korinna watched the mammoth herd.  She wore fur and hide clothes she'd made herself, bound up with homemade leather, a stone knife at her waist.  Hair streaming in the wind, she smiled at the way the huge beasts rumbled across the plain below her.  It was good to see something moving, perhaps even thriving, in this frozen waste.  The ash under her eyes cut the glare to something bearable, but even the glare was better than the alternating gloom and dark that marked the week-long blizzards.
			From the dreaming dead she knew winter.  But she'd also expected to see something of the other seasons, too.  No.  The whole world, so far as she knew, was covered with snow and ice.  She wasn't sure how much longer she could keep moving.  If the food and fuel ran out... she knew she wouldn't die.  Not from mere deprivation.  But to be trapped here, wasted and frozen, would to be in hell.  She'd throw herself off a cliff first.
			It had started so promisingly.  A great adventure away from mother and father.  She would see the living world that had born her father when he was of it, and that mother helped guard.  Her mother told Korinna that while the dreams could teach her much they could never teach her everything.  They were the interpreted world, not the experienced world.  Other people's interpretations, never her experience.  The odd hiding angel, Rahserat... she would help him enter Erebus, and then he'd be her guide there.  She was to obey him.  And she would, if she ever found him.  
			Where was he?
			With new traveling gear lifted from the dreaming of an adventuring Queen, Korinna had taken one of her secret uncle's routes from the underworld.  (Secret because he didn't know she was his niece.)  Stepping into Erebus was amazing.  There was air, and ground, and light in the underworld.  Of course.  But it wasn't the same as the air or earth or light of Erebus.  She really did feel closer to the One.  Or perhaps just not as oppressed by Arawn's shadow.
			And her journey to the Ivory Gate had been a revelation.  It was also long and arduous.  The snow had been the worst.  She hadn't figured out how to make hide and sinew snowshoes yet.  She hadn't figured out almost everything, yet.  The cold was the most incredible thing.  Dreamed cold was never, ever, half as painful, half as stinging, half as pervasive.  Cold was not something that really existed in the dreamlands, except as a pale imitation.
			But she had made it to the Ivory Gate, eventually.  Low on food, exhausted, she'd been looking forward to seeing Rahserat again.  Both for the company and because she knew an angel's power would be of immense help in the wilderness.  She'd climbed among the foothills and, guided by her mother's directions, found the Gate.  She'd taken the Gate's handle in hand and pulled.  If Rahserat was on the other side, it would open.  But it hadn't opened.  
			She'd arrived on the appointed day, and so she'd hauled on the gate all that day.  Her hands were continually sliced by the odd barbs in the ivory, but he never came.  No angel.  No company.  No help.
			That had been long ago.  She watched the stars whenever visible.  She kept careful records on the rock beside the gate when storms hid the stars.  On the appointed day she tried the Gate every year, and every year it did not open.
			Korinna made a home of a deep cave a day's journey from the Gate.   The great bear that had preceded her as owner furnished her with her first set of new clothes.  Now she sometimes worried that she'd hunt the hills bare of large game.  She recorded the courses of the stars, but she avoided recording the passage of years.  She didn't want to know how long she waited.  Had she been abandoned?
			She'd avoided men for decades.  Then loneliness had set in and she'd realized they could be company, of a sort.  Where before they had hunted her, having seen the smoke from her fires, she hunted them.  When she found a lone hunter she'd kill him, but first give him a message to pass to her mother.  The earliest ones, of course, she'd had teach her their language.  Korinna couldn't trust them to carry a message unless they repeated it back it her in their own tongue.  Twice she descended to the villages to seek an auger.  What she was told was hopeful, but the terrified, addled woman had made no sense.
			There were no seasons of note in the icy wasteland, and soon her life had taken on a timeless quality.  She hunted, she collected dung for fires or, occasionally, wood.  But she didn't like to go far from the Gate.  She composed long messages to her mother and dispatched them, along with a luckless  tribesman, at intervals.   When her clothes wore out she'd make new ones, or use those of a fallen tribesman.  She watched the animals, sometimes hunting just to observe, not kill.  And that was the scope of her days, of her life.  She slept through the nights and the storms and walked under the sky only when the sun was clear and shining.  In her bright land the centuries passed without mark.
			Until one year, on Gate day, both handles had come away in her hand.  She'd hauled on them just as the sun rose and the whole elaborate cross-piece had snapped off, putting a deep cut in her right hand.  She looked at the ivory in horror.  The occasional day of bright sun and relative warmth had, over a great span, caused it to corrode and crumble.  She'd never really known anger, or despair, until that day.
			She'd gone mad for a time.  She'd killed every man within a day's journey, saying terrible things to her mother.  She'd cursed her father, the faithless Rahserat, and the One.  She'd stopped eating and nearly froze before appetite overcame her.  She hadn't known it but she'd never really been hungry before, either.  She almost sent herself to her mother, but to do so would be to admit defeat.  
			Even after her black time she'd been bleak.  Perhaps for years, she didn't know.  But one day well after the tribes had returned, she had an idea.  Maybe the first new one in centuries.  
			She could repair the Gate.  She didn't know what magic might support it, and she'd never thought about where the Gate had come from, or who'd made it.  She just assumed it was something beyond time, incorruptible.  But not, at least, the physical form.  And that she could repair.  Her hands were wise now, after mortal lifetimes of craft, and there was plenty of ivory to be had.  The Gate... she could put it right.  She would.  
			And she did.  With a long, stone-tipped spear and as many knives as she could easily carry, she stalked and killed a great mammoth each year.   Harvesting the beast for fur, ivory, and a little leather, she'd carve and fit, taking the most time over the Gate's uncanny barbs, and shedding much blood.  It became part of the annual, futile ritual that was the only punctuation to her bright, changeless days. 
			Where was he?
			Rahserat had left the underworld feeling better than he had for ages.  Gyra, for reasons he couldn't fathom, was a unanticipated ally.  She hadn't helped him directly with his mission, true, but she still aided him in undermining Arawn, and she'd almost certainly make a better ally for his Lord than Laroth.  If nothing else he could return early and report these fortuitous events to Esus.  His Lord would know what to make of them.  But the angel's mood had dissolved as soon as he stepped into the Hidden Queen's passageway en route for the Ivory Gate.  It was not like last time.  Instead it was far darker, and shot through with red lights that clung to the edge  and only the edge  of vision.  Rahserat took a cautious step to the left, along the wall, and found himself instead moving somehow downwards.  Another step, and the passage became even darker, and he moved further downwards.  He tried to step upwards then, climb back, but the passage abruptly became pitch-black even to his vision, and the movement downward accelerated.  And did not stop.  Not for years.
			When he found himself again he was crawling across a gray stone floor toward a great stone chair.  A greenish light came into the chamber through a collapsed section of wall, along with a weird and terrible smell.  It was something like rot, something like the musk of a great beast, or a city.  It never faded.  Not over the weeks in which he crawled, or all the time in the chair itself.
			When he found himself seated in the chair, slowly turning to stone, the Hidden Queen finally spoke.  She had been watching him crawl, he realized now.  She castigated him for his betrayal, for never sending her the word she sought.
			Hadn't he?  He thought he'd had.  He'd broken his Lord's vial as soon as he'd arrived.  While the Queen gloated of traps and of deities, of bait, and of snares for the One, he thought about the vial and his Lord.  Had his Lord betrayed him?  Had the vial done anything at all?  The Hidden Queen couldn't be a comfortable ally.  His Lord might have lied.  That was his precept.  But then, the Hidden Queen could be lying too.  Or maybe his Lord had kept a secret, even if that was her precept.  Perhaps he'd wanted the Queen angered at Rahserat, but not able to reach him.  He, Rahserat, and broken from his Lord's thought by leaving the underworld much earlier than planned.  This eldritch prison, this bizarre torture, might be the result of his own good intentions.
			By the time he'd thought it through, perhaps taking years, the Hidden Queen was gone.  She'd said something about the end of creation.  Was that where he was?  The light had gone for a time, he thought, but it was back now.  He could see that a stone chair across from him had eyes, and was slowly turning into a man.  Not him.  The shadows stirred and giggled.  Their thoughts stabbed at him.
			His clothes had awakened from their slumber and left through the hole in the wall.  He could hear them screaming as something caught and ate them.  When the light turned to darkness this time he noticed that the shadows were unchanged in their dance.  He realized it hadn't turned to darkness so much that the darkness had become light.  Everything blurred here.  His thoughts into blood, light into darkness, the living into the unliving.  And the reverse, in everything.  Blood to thought.  Dark to light.  The unliving to the living.
			Souls sent by the false Laroth, sent not to a location but bound instead to him, began arriving.  He hid them in the stone.  They began their own changes, but slowly, as slowly as he could bend time.  Time was just breath, after all.  As the shadows mocked him he began to understand.  One thing wasn't becoming another.  No, all things were one thing here.  Unified.  If creation was endless variety this place was the end of creation.  Everything blurred together.  Why the One might be here, the Rahserats couldn't say.  Maybe when everything was one, they became the One?  Whether that was a semantic trick or a deep truth the Queen might be able to say, but they couldn't.
			The shadows having been consumed, the Rahserats pulled themselves back together.  He was stronger now, stronger than ever before, but stranger.  He thought he might be an archangel now.  He felt that powerful.  But whose archangel?
			With the predatory shadows gone space itself grew, and grew.  The chamber still had its break in the wall somewhere, but it was lost and tiny now.  The immense place was full of darkness, and stone.    Or things that were often darkness and stone.  That was the tendency, at least for now.  And now the souls were legion, but still placed in stone for relative safety.  There they lost themselves in dreams far more peculiar than they'd known before.  The darkness ate at Rahserat sometimes, and he writhed and ate at it.  Maybe the Queen hoped the One would come to save a poor trapped angel.  But he doubted it.
			Rahserat started skipping around in time.  Perhaps rather than becoming the One, this place was the antithesis of the One.  Where the One was existence, everything becoming the same as everything else was the most final sort of non-existence.  If everything existed as one  or One - there could, eventually, be no change.  And no new creation, for everything already existed.  Maybe the One would have to come here to destroy it.  Would Rahserat defend this place, this end of creation?  He might.
			But eventually he found a time when the darkness sounded like Korinna singing.  The souls in the stones actually noticed it first.  The singing came not from beyond the break in the wall.  He knew he could never go outside.  Must not.  But he didn't have to.  The singing came from a point of red.
			He ate the red.  Just the color, it was one he hadn't seen in awhile.  The point remained.   More points appeared, stains, and he ate the red in them too.  Skipping again, he found a time when a red door stood before him.  Rather than eating it, he asked his arms to push it.  They did.
			Korinna fell away as the door broke again, and cursed.  She'd thought she wouldn't have to renew the handles for three or four mammoths.  A man had somehow appeared on the snow between her and the Ivory Gate, and the Gate was a bottomless darkness rather than blooded ivory.  She blinked at the scene without comprehension for several moments before finally understanding.  The Gate was open!  He'd come!
			Or was this Rahserat?  He was shriveled, shrunken.  She turned him over and the blood from her hands soaked immediately into his skin and disappeared.  Then the snow under him did, too, and he was limned in darkness for a moment, apparently absorbing the light.  He stretched and grew, withered flesh replaced with smooth skin over dense muscle.  Korinna steadied herself as the hill seemed to tilt and Rahserat grew... not brighter, but everything else seemed to fade to background.  But at last he become the Rahserat she dimly remembered.  Then he opened his eyes.  They weren't what she remembered.</Spanish>

		<English>The lord of the Scions claims to be one of Kylorin's original students, now returned from the Underworld. He says he will reclaim Erebus for the glory of Patria. The first claim is almost certainly false. As to the second, only time will tell.[PARAGRAPH:1]Other than the risen-dead few have seen the Emperor. But it is said he is surrounded by a clear, penetrating light, yet where he walks the world bends.[PARAGRAPH:1]Other leaders have learned to never insist that an envoy see the Emperor and instead prefer to deal with officers of the Apparat - An audience with the Emperor himself always leads to the acceptance of whatever terms he names. That they always seem good and fair is all the more worrying.[PARAGRAPH:1]With the Risen Emperor to watch over the Bottomless Tomb Korinna, the Tomb's immortal guardian, is free to become a Hero for the Scions. First protecting the capital, and later waging war beyond it.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Part 1: In a Bright Land[NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_2]Part 2: In a Bright Land[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_3]Part 3: In a Bright Land[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_4]Part 4: In a Bright Land[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:1]In a bright land, in a white city, in a dark room a great emperor sits on a gold throne, still. Eyes of eagle-sharpness that can can look from every Mark, from the eyes of disciples, can with even greater ease look inward and long ago. To a long ago where there lay another bright land, another white city, and the throne of another great emperor. He closes his eyes, and remembers.[PARAGRAPH:1]The one who currently used the name Lareth sat up in the cart at sunrise. He was high enough in the foothills to see the plains stretch beneath him as if warmed and waked by the sun. And he was sharp sighted enough to see a herd move in the far distance. Cattle, of course. But he was sure his last mission was successful.[PARAGRAPH:1]The new wizards were uncertain of their power and more uncertain about the emperor's purposes. He could sympathize. Lareth himself wasn't entirely easy with his role. He knew he was violating the Compact's spirit even if he *arguably* abided by its rules. But his Lord assured him he wouldn't be caught, and despite everything he'd still accept his Lord's word. They had suffered the greatest possible abandonment, and his work must be done for Creation's salvation.[PARAGRAPH:1]So as Lareth he'd gone to the wizards... and merely asked questions. Could they bring greater prosperity to the plains? As a stock man (which was how he presented himself) he wanted to know if the wizards could improve his stock. Could they make the horses faster, stronger? Could they make the cattle fatter, hardier? He'd been so earnest that they'd laughed, and told him "Of course." He'd pretended anger and told them they misunderstood. He could breed faster horses, fatter cattle. All without magic. And so could the Hippus. Probably better, truth be told.[PARAGRAPH:1]What could they do that was different, with their airs and their special knowledge and their magic? Could they do better than the Horselords? Make an ox as fast as a horse? A horse as hardy as a bull... a horse that could fly? Now that would be useful. And that had caught their imaginations. Of course. It was a worthy task. It would feed more people and allow them to work harder, move faster. It would give the Patrians comfort while also making the empire stronger. One of the wizards looked disturbed, but the others were themselves comforted. They knew then that what the emperor offered was power, and it could make a better future. They knew the emperor could be trusted, for he - and they! - acted with good intentions. So there would be changling beasts on the plains... for a better future.[PARAGRAPH:1]It wasn't long before the cart stopped at a temple to Sirona. Ironic.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth hopped to the muddy road. A cold breeze ran down it, escaping the mountains, and he acted glad for his sheltering cloak. He gave the driver a few coins and hurried through the door of an inn beside the temple.[PARAGRAPH:1]The roof was low, and while ducking beams he spotted his target. She sat alone at a table against the far wall. He knew she'd been here for several days. She'd meant to leave with a south-bound caravan but had been deceived about its route. So here she'd waited for him, unknowing of their appointment. Eating well of the inn's food, he was sure, but feeding mostly on her doubts.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth skirted the near wall and took the table furthest from the bar. He didn't want to call attention to himself. Their conversation should be private and uninterrupted. How to begin it, though, was a problem. She looked skittish.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Breakfast and a drink, my lord, or just drink?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth looked up at the serving girl, and smiled. She dropped her laden tray with a tremendous clatter and every eye in the inn turned to his table. So much for obscurity. Blushing, stammering and apologizing excessively, the girl reloaded her tray. Thankfully the mugs and plates had been empty. Exerting a little influence to calm the girl, he introduced himself and ordered some soup as gently as he could. Feeling sorry for her he spread that influence over the rest of the room. Otherwise she'd be mocked. It was a little risky, but maybe it'd calm his target, too. However he decided to approach her, that'd probably help.[PARAGRAPH:1]He'd just taken his soup from the girl, who was blushing again, when a woman spoke behind him.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Laroth?"[PARAGRAPH:1]He turned. "Excuse me?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Laroth! No..."[PARAGRAPH:1]His target. Younger than he'd thought. However much he might have calmed her earlier she was now agitated and confused.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth stood , pulling back a chair for her, and guided her into it.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hello! I'm sorry, what's wrong? Here, please sit down."[PARAGRAPH:1]She gasped a few breaths and said, "No, I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else."[PARAGRAPH:1]He sat down himself. "Well, let me make it three apologies between us: I'm sorry if I've upset you."[PARAGRAPH:1]She shook her head. "My fault. It's just that you sound like him, and what was your name...?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Lareth."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Lareth, yes. It's much like his. Laroth's, I mean."[PARAGRAPH:1]"An easy mistake to make then."[PARAGRAPH:1]"You look like him too." He laughed nervously. "It's uncanny, really."[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth smiled with her, to put her at ease. But he was sure she was right. His Lord had provided his name for this foray. As for his voice and appearance... He knew well that what seemed coincidence generally wasn't. Not if a god was involved. Not that you could ever be sure which god. Not anymore.[PARAGRAPH:1]Instead he said, "Please, let me make up for fate's jest. Share my table. I've been on the road for days and would appreciate conversation before I move on. My mule and I have exhausted all topics of mutual interest."[PARAGRAPH:1]She laughed delightedly at his joke, despite herself. Lareth didn't flatter himself, people always laughed his jokes. But he was glad she was at his table, his way apparently already prepared by his Lord, and that he could get this over with. He'd heard of Laroth, and what he'd heard he didn't like. While Lareth's ability to anticipate the future was nothing like his Lord's, or his Lord's peers, he could guess how his mission would shape the future for this woman.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nevertheless, he'd see it done.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Have you had breakfast yet? No?" He waved the attentive server to him. "Allow me to offer you some of this fine soup. While I wash the road's dust from my throat tell me what you're doing here."[PARAGRAPH:1]She slumped in her chair, nursing the soup, and gradually he drew her out. She must have wanted someone to talk to, it wasn't hard. Her name was Tejia, and her lover was indeed the itinerant holy man Laroth. He was starting to make a name for himself by preaching of the god Temeluchus. A being with whom Lareth was not acquainted. Tejia wouldn't denounce Laroth, but it was obvious to Lareth she knew the preacher insincere, at best.[PARAGRAPH:1]Finally he volunteered some advice: "Tejia, what you both face is a crisis of faith."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes," she said. "I think I am."[PARAGRAPH:1]"I'm sorry, I said you both face a crisis of faith. He's clearly performing a valuable service to Patria, to the whole world, by his preaching. Yet you sense he has doubts. Strong, doubts, yes?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes." She nodded uncertainly.[PARAGRAPH:1]"But you know his message is right, don't you." He made it a statement, which left her little choice.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes." This time her nod was emphatic.[PARAGRAPH:1]"So you must strengthen his faith. Not everyone has equal gifts, Tejia. I'm sure you know this, but in this case I think while Laroth has a great gift for speaking, you have a greater gift for faith. Take it as a testament to his teaching that you have learned so well. But now, having learned..."[PARAGRAPH:1]Tejia straightened in her chair and interrupted him. "Yes! My faith can strengthen his."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Very good!" Lareth looked at her encouragingly, but it was hardly needed.[PARAGRAPH:1]She smiled beatifically. "Not only was I feeling bad about doubting Laroth, but I wondered how I could contribute. Just being his... just being with him didn't seem enough. But I can serve Temeluchus, too! I can really help people see the truth."[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth returned her smile. "Exactly."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thank you!" Her smile grew even brighter. "I should have seen this before." Lareth shrugged depreciatively, and she finished. "No, really. I did lack faith. But the heart will find a way if you've good intentions."[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth's gaze flickered, just for an instant. He'd placed the barb and twisted this woman as his Lord wished. Probably to twist this Laroth in turn. And who knew after that? He didn't know why his Lord wanted this, but suspected the hand of the Hidden Queen. He knew she'd made certain offers to his Lord, and she'd been very active of late. But how active?[PARAGRAPH:1]Tejia last remark pained him, and he wondered if someone wanted a barb in him.[PARAGRAPH:1]In a bright land in a white city, in a dark room he feels that pain anew. Such is the memory of his kind that the past may be relived as a sort of dream. This keeps both hatreds and loves, hurts and kindnesses, fresh and immune to the passage of time. Whether this makes for greater wisdom or greater folly the emperor does not know. But the dreaming is hard to resist. He believes it makes Sabathiel weak, but gives Cassiel strength. For himself he knows there's a special danger.[PARAGRAPH:1]Eyes of eagle-sharpness that can look from every Mark, from the eyes of disciples, can with even greater ease look inward and long ago. But how deeply can they see? What do they miss, and what is hidden with ill intent? He is the Angel of Good Intentions, and those he can always see, can always twist. Believing they pursue the good, men may be led very far from their chosen path. Yet to ill intentions, to deception, he's just as blind as any other being. Maybe more blind.[PARAGRAPH:1]His eyes open, he watches motes of dust play within a sunbeam now piercing the hall. It looks so real. Fully in the present again, he no longer dreams.</English>
		<French>[H1]Dans une contrée prospère[\H1][NEWLINE]Chapitre 1 : Dans une contrée prospère, l'Empereur Ressuscité[PARAGRAPH:2]Le seigneur des Scions prétend être un des élèves originels de Kylorin, aujourd'hui revenu de l'Outremonde. Il clame qu'il conquerra Erebus pour la gloire de Patria. La première assertion est certainement fausse. Pour la seconde, seul le temps nous le dira.[PARAGRAPH:1]À part les morts-vivants, peu ont vu l'Empereur. Mais on raconte qu'il est entouré d'une lumière claire et prénétrante, et pourtant, là où il marche le monde ploie.[PARAGRAPH:1]Les autres dirigeants ont appris à ne pas insister pour que leurs ambassadeurs rencontrent l'Empereur, et préfèrent faire affaire avec les officiers de l'Apparat. En effet, une audience avec l'Empereur lui-même conduit systématiquement à l'acceptation sans condition des termes émis par l'Empereur. Et qu'ils les trouvent toujours bons et justes est d'autant plus inquiétant.[PARAGRAPH:1]Comme l'Empereur Ressuscité surveille la Tombe Sans Fond de Korinna, le guardien immortel de la Tombe est libre de devenir un héros pour les Scions. D'abord en protégeant la capitale, puis en guerroyant.[PARAGRAPH:2]Dans une contrée prospère, dans une blanche ville, dans une pièce sombre un grand empereur est assis sur son trône doré, immobile. Ses yeux possèdent l'acuité de l'aigle et peuvent voir au travers de chaque Marque, des yeux de chaque disciple, et peuvent encore plus facilement scruter les esprits et le passé. Jusqu'à un passé où gisent une autre contrée prospère, une autre ville blanche, et le trône d'un autre grand empereur. Il ferme les yeux et se souvient.[PARAGRAPH:1]Celui actuellement nommé Lareth s'assit dans le chariot au lever du jour. Il était suffisamemnt haut dans les conteforts pour voir les plaines s'étirer sous lui comme si elles étaient éveillées et réchauffées par le soleil. Et il avait une assez bonne vue pour voir un troupeau se déplacer au loin. Du bétail, bien sûr. Mais il était sûr du succès de sa dernière mission.[PARAGRAPH:1]Les nouveaux magiciens étaient dubitatifs quant à leurs pouvoirs, et plus encore quant aux objectifs de l'empereur. Il pourrait sympathiser. Lareth lui-même n'était pas vraiment à l'aise avec son rôle. Il savait qu'il violait l'esprit du Pacte même s'il restait 'raisonnablement' conforme à ses règles. Mais son Seigneur lui assurait qu'il ne serait pas pris, et malgré tout il se conformerait aux instructions de son Seigneur. Ils avaient subi le pire abandon possible, et son travail devait être fait pour le salut de Création. Ainsi, sous le nom de Lareth il était parti vers les magiciens... et posa simplement des questions. Pouvaient-ils apporter la prospérité aux plaines ? En tant qu'éleveur (il s'était présenté comme tel) il voulait savoir si les magiciens pouvaient agrandir son troupeau. Pouvaient-ils rendre les chevaux plus rapides, plus forts ? Pouvaient-ils rendre le bétail plus gras, plus résistant ? Il avait été si sérieux qu'ils avaient ri, puis répondu "Bien sûr". Il simula la colère et leur dit qu'ils se trompaient. Il pouvait donner naissance à des chevaux plus rapides et du bétail plus gras. Le tout sans magie. De même que les Hippusques. Probablement meilleurs, à dire vrai.[PARAGRAPH:1]Que pouvaient-ils faire de différent, avec leurs airs, leur savoir particulier et leur magie ? Pouvaient-ils faire mieux que les Seigneurs des Chevaux ? Faire un b&#156;uf aussi rapide qu'un cheval ? Un cheval aussi résistant qu'un taureau... un cheval capable de voler ? Aujourd'hui ça pourrait être utile. Et ça a stimulé leur imagination. Évidemment. C'était une tâche louable. Ça nourrirrait plus de gens, et leur permettrait de travailler plus dur, de se déplacer plus vite. Ça procurerait aux Patriens plus de confort tout en renforçant l'empire. Un des magiciens sembla troublé, mais les autres achevèrent de se convaincre. Ils savaient alors que ce que l'empereur leur offrait était le pouvoir et qu'il pouvait créer un futur meilleur. Ils savaient qu'ils pouvaient faire confiance à l'empereur, car il (et eux aussi !) agissaient avec de nobles intentions. Il y aurait donc des bêtes mutantes dans les plaines... pour un futur meilleur.[PARAGRAPH:1]Peu après le chariot s'arrêta à un temple de Sirona. Ironique.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth sauta sur la route boueuse. Un vent froid descendait le long de la route, s'échappant des montagnes, et il fut heureux de porter sont manteau protecteur. Il donna au conducteur quelques pièces et se pressa vers la porte d'une auberge située à côté du temple.[PARAGRAPH:1]Le plafond était bas, et il repéra sa cible au milieu de la foule. Elle était assise seule à une table collée au mur du fond. Il savait qu'elle était là depuis plusieurs jours. Elle était censée partir avec une caravane du sud, mais s'était méprise sur sa route. Ainsi elle l'attendait là, inconsciente de leur rendez-vous. Mangeant convenablement à l'auberge, il en était sûr, mais se nourissant principalement de ses doutes.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth longea le mur proche et s'attabla le plus loin possible du bar. Il ne souhaitait pas attirer l'attention. Leur conversation devait être privée et ininterrompue. Comment la démarrer était cependant un problème. Elle semblait nerveuse.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Petit-déjeuner et boisson, mon seigneur, ou juste une boisson ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth leva les yeux vers la serveuse et sourit. Elle lâcha son plateau dans un fracas assourdissant et tous les yeux se tournèrent vers sa table. Autant pour la discrétion. Rougissante, bégayant et s'excusant à outrance, la fille récupéra son plateau. Heureusement les choppes et les assiettes étaient vides. Faisant en sorte de calmer la fille, il se présenta et commanda de la soupe aussi gentiment qu'il le pût. Se senant désolé pour elle il étendit son influence au reste de la pièce. Elle aurait sinon été raillée. C'était un peu risqué, mais peut-être que ça calmerait également sa cible. Totuefois il décida de s'approcher d'elle, et ceci l'aiderait probablement.[PARAGRAPH:1]Il venait de se faire servir sa soupe par la fille qui rougissait à nouveau quand une femme parla derrière lui.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Laroth ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Il se retourna. "Excusez-moi ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Laroth ! Non..."[PARAGRAPH:1]Sa cible, plus jeune qu'il ne le pensait. Quel que soit le calme qu'il lui avait imposée elle était maintenant nerveuse et confuse. Lareth se leva, recula une chaise à son attention et la guida pour s'asseoir.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Bonjour ! Je suis désolé, quelque chose ne va pas ? Venez, asseyez-vous s'il vous plait."[PARAGRAPH:1]Elle haleta un peu et répondit, "Non, je suis désolée. Je vous ai pris pour un autre."[PARAGRAPH:1]Il s'assit. "Et bien, laissez moi en faire une triple excuse : je suis désolé si je vous ai fâchée."[PARAGRAPH:1]Elle secoua la tête. "C'est ma faute. C'est jsute que vous avez la même voix que lui, et quel était votre nom... ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Lareth."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Lareth, oui. Ça y ressemble beaucoup. Laroth, je veux dire."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Une confusion facile, donc."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Vous lui ressemblez également." Elle rit nerveusement. "C'est vraiment troublant."[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth lui sourit, pour la mettre à l'aise. Mais il était sûr qu'elle avait raison. son Seigneur lui avait donné ce nom pour cette incursion. De même que cette voix et cette apparence... Il savait pertinemment que ce qui pouvait sembler être une coïncidence ne l'était généralement pas. Pas si un dieu était impliqué. Encore que vous ne pouvez jamais en être sûr de quel dieu. Plus maintenant.[PARAGRAPH:1]Il répondit plutôt, "S'il vous plait, laissez-moi m'excuser pour ce coup du destin. Asseyez-vous à ma table. Je suis sur la route depuis des jours, et j'apprécierais un peu de conversation avant de repartir. Ma mule et moi avons épuisé tous nous sujets d'intérêt commun."[PARAGRAPH:1]Elle rit de bon c&#156;ur à sa blague, malgré elle. Lareth ne s'en flatta pas, les gens riaient toujours à ses blagues. Mais il était heureux de la voir à sa table, son chemin apparemment déjà tracé par son Seigneur afin qu'il s'en sorte. Il avait entendu aprler de Laroth et ce qu'il avait entendu ne lui avait pas plu. Bien que la capacité de Lareth à prévoir le futur n'était rien comparée à celle de son Seigneur ou de Ses égaux, il pouvait deviner comment sa mission modifierait le futur de cette femme.Toutefois ce devait être fait.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Avez-vous déjà pris votre petit-déjeuner ? Non ?" Il attira la serveuse attentive à lui. "Permettez moi de vous offrir un peu de cette bonne soupe. Tandis que je décrasse mon gosier de la poussière de la route, dites moi ce que vous venez faire ici."[PARAGRAPH:1]Elle s'affaissa sur sa chaise, penchée sur sa soupe, et il l'en sortit progressivement. Elle devait avoir voulu quelqu'un pour se confier, ce fut donc facile. Son nom était Tejia, et son amant était effectivement le saint homme itinérant Laroth. Il commençait à se faire un nom en prêchant au nom du dieu Temeluchus. Un être inconnu de Lareth. Tejia ne trahirait jamais Laroth, mais il était clair pour Lareth qu'elle savait le prêcheur non sincère au mieux.[PARAGRAPH:1] Il donna finalement un conseil : "Tejia, ce que vous traversez tous les deux est une crise de foi."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Oui," répondit-elle, "je crois aussi que c'est ce qu'il m'arrive."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Excusez-moi, je disais que vous traversiez tous les deux une crise de foi. Il rend clairement un grand service à Patria, au monde entier, en prêchant. Et pourtant vous sentez qu'il a des doutes. De gros doutes, n'est-ce pas ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Oui." Elle acquiesca timidement.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mais vous savez que son message est vrai, hein." Il l'avait affirmé, lui laissant peu de choix.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Oui." Cette fois son signe de tête était empathique.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Vous devez donc renforcer sa foi. Tout le monde ne dispose pas des mêmes dons, Tejia. Je suis sûr que vous les savez, mais dans votre cas, je pense que Laroth a un vrai don d'éloquence, tandis que votre don réside dans votre foi. Prenez-le comme un testament de ses enseignements que vousa vez si bien appris. Mais maintenant, l'avoir appris..."[PARAGRAPH:1]Tejia se redresa sur sa haise et l'interrompit. "Oui ! Ma foi peut renforcer la sienne."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Bien !" Lareth la regarda en l'encourageant, mais ce n'était pas vraiment nécesaire.[PARAGRAPH:1]Elle sourit béatement. "Non seulement je me sentais mal de douter de Laroth, mais en plus je me demandais comment l'aider. N'être que son... n'être qu'avec lui ne semblait pas assez. Mais je peux servir Temeluchus aussi ! Je peux vraiment aider les gens à ouvrir les yeux."[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth lui rendit son sourire. "Exactement."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Merci !" Son sourire devient encore plus éclatant. "J'aurais dû le voir plus tôt." Lareth haussa modestement les épaules, et elle poursuivit. "non, vraiment. J'ai manqué de foi. Mais votre c&#156;ur trouvera un moyen si vous avez de bonnes intentions."[PARAGRAPH:1]Le regard de Lareth vacilla un instant. Il avait tendu son piège et y avait pris cete femme comme le souhaitait son Seigneur. Proabalement pour pièger ce Laroth en retour. Et après qui sait ? Il ne savait pas pourquoi son Seigneur le souhaitait, mais il y suspectait la main de la Reine Cachée. Il savait qu'elle avait fait des offres à son Seigneur, et elle avait été très active dernièrement. Mais active dans quel sens ?[PARAGRAPH:1]La dernière remarque de Tejia lui fit de la peine, et se demanda si quelqu'un cherchait à lui nuire.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dans une contrée prospère, dans une ville blanche, dans une pièce sombre, il ressentit à nouveau cette peine. Les souvenirs de ses pairs sont ainsi faits que le passé peut être revécu comme une sorte de rêve. Ça préserve les haines et les amours, les blessures et les gentillesses comme au premier jour. Que cela mène à une sagesse plus profonde ou à une folie plus intense, l'empereur l'ignorait. Mais il est difficile de résister au rêve. Il crois qu'il affaiblit Sabathiel, mais renforce Cassiel. Pour lui-même il est conscient d'un danger particulier.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ses yeux possèdent l'acuité de l'aigle et peuvent voir au travers de chaque Marque, des yeux de chaque disciple, et peuvent encore plus facilement scruter les esprits et le passé. Mais jusqu'où peuvent-ils voir ? Qu'est-ce qui leur échappe, et qu'est-ce qui est caché avec de mauvaises intentions ? Il est l'Ange des Bonnes Intentions, et ceux qu'il peut toujours voir, peuvent toujours se corrompre. En croyant suivre la voie du bien, les hommes peuvent être menés bien loin de leur chemin choisi. Et pourtant, vis à vis des mauvaises intentions, des trahisons, il est tout aussi aveugle que n'importe qui. Peut-être même plus.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ses yeux ouverts, il observe des grains de poussière jouant dans le rayon de soleil qui perce l'entrée. Ça semble si réel. Complètement revenu dans le présent, il ne rêve plus.[NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_2]Chapitre 2 : Dans une contrée prospère, l'Éveillé[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_3]Chapitre 3 : Dans une contrée prospère, Korinna[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_4]Chapitre 4 : Dans une contrée prospère, la Cathédrale de la Renaissance[\LINK]</French>

Make an ox as fast as a horse? A horse as hardy as a bull... a horse that could fly? Now that would be useful. And that had caught their imaginations. Of course. It was a worthy task. It would feed more people and allow them to work harder, move faster. It would give the Patrians comfort while also making the empire stronger. One of the wizards looked disturbed, but the others were themselves comforted. They knew then that what the emperor offered was power, and it could make a better future. They knew the emperor could be trusted, for he - and they! - acted with good intentions. So there would be changling beasts on the plains... for a better future.[PARAGRAPH:1]It wasn't long before the cart stopped at a temple to Sirona. Ironic.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth hopped to the muddy road. A cold breeze ran down it, escaping the mountains, and he acted glad for his sheltering cloak. He gave the driver a few coins and hurried through the door of an inn beside the temple.[PARAGRAPH:1]The roof was low, and while ducking beams he spotted his target. She sat alone at a table against the far wall. He knew she'd been here for several days. She'd meant to leave with a south-bound caravan but had been deceived about its route. So here she'd waited for him, unknowing of their appointment. Eating well of the inn's food, he was sure, but feeding mostly on her doubts.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth skirted the near wall and took the table furthest from the bar. He didn't want to call attention to himself. Their conversation should be private and uninterrupted. How to begin it, though, was a problem. She looked skittish.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Breakfast and a drink, my lord, or just drink?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth looked up at the serving girl, and smiled. She dropped her laden tray with a tremendous clatter and every eye in the inn turned to his table. So much for obscurity. Blushing, stammering and apologizing excessively, the girl reloaded her tray. Thankfully the mugs and plates had been empty. Exerting a little influence to calm the girl, he introduced himself and ordered some soup as gently as he could. Feeling sorry for her he spread that influence over the rest of the room. Otherwise she'd be mocked. It was a little risky, but maybe it'd calm his target, too. However he decided to approach her, that'd probably help.[PARAGRAPH:1]He'd just taken his soup from the girl, who was blushing again, when a woman spoke behind him.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Laroth?"[PARAGRAPH:1]He turned. "Excuse me?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Laroth! No..."[PARAGRAPH:1]His target. Younger than he'd thought. However much he might have calmed her earlier she was now agitated and confused.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth stood , pulling back a chair for her, and guided her into it.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Hello! I'm sorry, what's wrong? Here, please sit down."[PARAGRAPH:1]She gasped a few breaths and said, "No, I'm sorry. I thought you were someone else."[PARAGRAPH:1]He sat down himself. "Well, let me make it three apologies between us: I'm sorry if I've upset you."[PARAGRAPH:1]She shook her head. "My fault. It's just that you sound like him, and what was your name...?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Lareth."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Lareth, yes. It's much like his. Laroth's, I mean."[PARAGRAPH:1]"An easy mistake to make then."[PARAGRAPH:1]"You look like him too." He laughed nervously. "It's uncanny, really."[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth smiled with her, to put her at ease. But he was sure she was right. His Lord had provided his name for this foray. As for his voice and appearance... He knew well that what seemed coincidence generally wasn't. Not if a god was involved. Not that you could ever be sure which god. Not anymore.[PARAGRAPH:1]Instead he said, "Please, let me make up for fate's jest. Share my table. I've been on the road for days and would appreciate conversation before I move on. My mule and I have exhausted all topics of mutual interest."[PARAGRAPH:1]She laughed delightedly at his joke, despite herself. Lareth didn't flatter himself, people always laughed his jokes. But he was glad she was at his table, his way apparently already prepared by his Lord, and that he could get this over with. He'd heard of Laroth, and what he'd heard he didn't like. While Lareth's ability to anticipate the future was nothing like his Lord's, or his Lord's peers, he could guess how his mission would shape the future for this woman.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nevertheless, he'd see it done.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Have you had breakfast yet? No?" He waved the attentive server to him. "Allow me to offer you some of this fine soup. While I wash the road's dust from my throat tell me what you're doing here."[PARAGRAPH:1]She slumped in her chair, nursing the soup, and gradually he drew her out. She must have wanted someone to talk to, it wasn't hard. Her name was Tejia, and her lover was indeed the itinerant holy man Laroth. He was starting to make a name for himself by preaching of the god Temeluchus. A being with whom Lareth was not acquainted. Tejia wouldn't denounce Laroth, but it was obvious to Lareth she knew the preacher insincere, at best.[PARAGRAPH:1]Finally he volunteered some advice: "Tejia, what you both face is a crisis of faith."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes," she said. "I think I am."[PARAGRAPH:1]"I'm sorry, I said you both face a crisis of faith. He's clearly performing a valuable service to Patria, to the whole world, by his preaching. Yet you sense he has doubts. Strong, doubts, yes?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes." She nodded uncertainly.[PARAGRAPH:1]"But you know his message is right, don't you." He made it a statement, which left her little choice.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes." This time her nod was emphatic.[PARAGRAPH:1]"So you must strengthen his faith. Not everyone has equal gifts, Tejia. I'm sure you know this, but in this case I think while Laroth has a great gift for speaking, you have a greater gift for faith. Take it as a testament to his teaching that you have learned so well. But now, having learned..."[PARAGRAPH:1]Tejia straightened in her chair and interrupted him. "Yes! My faith can strengthen his."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Very good!" Lareth looked at her encouragingly, but it was hardly needed.[PARAGRAPH:1]She smiled beatifically. "Not only was I feeling bad about doubting Laroth, but I wondered how I could contribute. Just being his... just being with him didn't seem enough. But I can serve Temeluchus, too! I can really help people see the truth."[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth returned her smile. "Exactly."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Thank you!" Her smile grew even brighter. "I should have seen this before." Lareth shrugged depreciatively, and she finished. "No, really. I did lack faith. But the heart will find a way if you've good intentions."[PARAGRAPH:1]Lareth's gaze flickered, just for an instant. He'd placed the barb and twisted this woman as his Lord wished. Probably to twist this Laroth in turn. And who knew after that? He didn't know why his Lord wanted this, but suspected the hand of the Hidden Queen. He knew she'd made certain offers to his Lord, and she'd been very active of late. But how active?[PARAGRAPH:1]Tejia last remark pained him, and he wondered if someone wanted a barb in him.[PARAGRAPH:1]In a bright land in a white city, in a dark room he feels that pain anew. Such is the memory of his kind that the past may be relived as a sort of dream. This keeps both hatreds and loves, hurts and kindnesses, fresh and immune to the passage of time. Whether this makes for greater wisdom or greater folly the emperor does not know. But the dreaming is hard to resist. He believes it makes Sabathiel weak, but gives Cassiel strength. For himself he knows there's a special danger.[PARAGRAPH:1]Eyes of eagle-sharpness that can look from every Mark, from the eyes of disciples, can with even greater ease look inward and long ago. But how deeply can they see? What do they miss, and what is hidden with ill intent? He is the Angel of Good Intentions, and those he can always see, can always twist. Believing they pursue the good, men may be led very far from their chosen path. Yet to ill intentions, to deception, he's just as blind as any other being. Maybe more blind.[PARAGRAPH:1]His eyes open, he watches motes of dust play within a sunbeam now piercing the hall. It looks so real. Fully in the present again, he no longer dreams.</German>
		<Italian>The lord of the Scions claims to be one of Kylorin's original students, now returned from the Underworld. He says he will reclaim Erebus for the glory of Patria.

Eyes of eagle-sharpness that can can look from every Mark, from the eyes of disciples, can with even greater ease look inward and long ago. To a long ago where there lay another bright land, another white city, and the throne of another great emperor. He closes his eyes, and remembers.[PARAGRAPH:1]The one who currently used the name Lareth sat up in the cart at sunrise. He was high enough in the foothills to see the plains stretch beneath him as if warmed and waked by the sun. And he was sharp sighted enough to see a herd move in the far distance. Cattle, of course. But he was sure his last mission was successful.[PARAGRAPH:1]The new wizards were uncertain of their power and more uncertain about the emperor's purposes. He could sympathize. Lareth himself wasn't entirely easy with his role. He knew he was violating the Compact's spirit even if he *arguably* abided by its rules. But his Lord assured him he wouldn't be caught, and despite everything he'd still accept his Lord's word. They had suffered the greatest possible abandonment, and his work must be done for Creation's salvation.[PARAGRAPH:1]So as Lareth he'd gone to the wizards... and merely asked questions. Could they bring greater prosperity to the plains? As a stock man (which was how he presented himself) he wanted to know if the wizards could improve his stock. Could they make the horses faster, stronger? Could they make the cattle fatter, hardier? He'd been so earnest that they'd laughed, and told him "Of course." He'd pretended anger and told them they misunderstood. He could breed faster horses, fatter cattle. All without magic. And so could the Hippus.

But how deeply can they see? What do they miss, and what is hidden with ill intent? He is the Angel of Good Intentions, and those he can always see, can always twist. Believing they pursue the good, men may be led very far from their chosen path. Yet to ill intentions, to deception, he's just as blind as any other being. Maybe more blind.[PARAGRAPH:1]His eyes open, he watches motes of dust play within a sunbeam now piercing the hall. It looks so real. Fully in the present again, he no longer dreams.</Spanish>

		<English>The Opening of the Way:  A passage from the End of Creation, through the Underworld, and to Erebus is temporarily opened.  Many Scions, including the False Laroth, enter Erebus at a random location.  Triggered by Themoch, and requireing 'Sorcery'.  The more advanced the Scions are technologically the more units may be brought through.  Arcane techs tend to grant Arcane units, Economic techs supplies, Military techs military units and Religious techs Awakened.  The Help pop up will give a unit total by type.
			The wind rushes up the hillside without noise, swallowed whole by a hungry sky.  The lone rider's gently flapping, twisting mantle is the only sign of its passage.  The rider too is silent.  The hooves of his horse strike the ground without sound or sign.  The beast itself never whinnies or nickers, or vocalizes in any way.
			The rider, Themoch, sometimes seems to.  His lips move in a silent curse as he reigns his horse on the barren hilltop and dismounts to the bloody ground.  Another silent man and horse are here, though entirely without motion.  Neither will move again.
			The horse looks to have died from multiple arrow wounds, but the man was hacked apart.  Themoch reads no malice into the act.  Being an imperial soldier that's exactly what was needed.  He checks the man's torso.  No message pouch, and no message.  Probably destroyed or, worse, taken.  But Themoch extends his search and finally locates the messenger's right arm.  Looking, he finds grit under the nails.  It isn't long before he finds the shallow hiding hole, and the pouch.  In the pouch is a single terse message:  "Let the Breach open.  Tell him."
			Themoch checks the seals.  The note is from the Emperor's own hand.  An enemy finding this wouldn't have know the import of this short message, but Themoch does.  Even so, he doesn't hesitate.
			He rises from his crouch and again moves his lips as if speaking.  Still without sound.  No ears on that hill, no matter how sensitive, would hear a word.  Only a lip reader could have made out any meaning.
			And yet... in another place entirely a man without eyes hears Themoch, as he always hears Themoch.  His crowned head lifts at the sound of his name, and he hears Themoch's own short message.

He remembers taking Korinna's stone knives and driving them through the Ivory Gate.  They sank into the softer stone behind the open door, pinning it open.  He remembers the first expeditions beyond the Gate, into what was now called the Bottomless Tomb.  In his absence the dead got on with their weird, slow dreaming, and had to be enticed out with offerings and pleadings.  The Emperor, Rahserat, wondered just how much of their living existence they spent dreaming.  If they never really stopped and only met each other only where their dreams intersected.  Whether they ever really lived in the deciphered world.
			They never dreamed in the vaults of Agares and his allies.  Maybe thats what hell was, to have imposed on you the dreams of others.
			But for an angel the dreaming-that-is-memory must eventually give way to action.  To decision.  Now he wanted a messenger, and one of his guards left to summon one.  Another brought pen, ink, and vellum.  When the agent stood before him Rahserat had a scroll ready.  There would be a new campaign, and it was time for the opening of the way.  From the end of creation, through the underworld, and into Erebus.  The Breach.
			He'd soon see that long separated reflection of himself, the false Laroth.  What had it grown into, he wondered.  Gyra would know of the Breach immediately.  Would she see this as a fulfillment of her plans, or a betrayal?
			[ITALICS]"I know who you are, though you do not."[\ITALICS]	
			Enough of memory, now he had another decision to make.  The army from beyond the Breach was necessary whether he attacked or consolidated his empire.  But should he attack, or just hold?  This was a critical time, a pivot, and whether or not the Scions declared now for the forces of rising Armageddon or waited, hoping for greater effect later, could decide the fate of the world.  To wait might be to wait too long.  What would his Lord have him do?  The world must be saved.  He wanted only the best...
			[ITALICS]"I know who you are, though you do not."[\ITALICS]	
			A ringing and clattering shattered the quiet of the throne room as a hundred guardswomen all fell as one.  The Emperor went still and cold.  Finally, he understood what she meant.  
			Everything:   Nemed's trials, Mammon speaking before the assembled ranks, the War, the Compact, flashed through his mind.  Iaegus' pointed cruelties.  Esus' plots and plans.  The God of Deception.  And Trust. 
			Rahserat had acted only as he thought was best for the world.  He had gone against the revealed will of the One, yes, but he had acted only with the best of intentions.  It was a minor precept, but he'd never abandoned it!  Never corrupted it.  He had been deceived, or at least led astray, but he had never abandoned his precept.  He had never fallen.
			In a bright land, on a bright throne, in a room where a hundred identical women lie unconscious, with the guards outside hammering on the door, desperate to know if their Emperor is safe, their Emperor doubts his safety.
			He had never fallen.  But now he could.  He had been persuaded, before.  He had been mistaken.  Even an angel, obeying his purpose, can be twisted around that purpose.  Yet from the moment he'd realized that no fall was behind him, a gulf opened before him.  He could stay consistent with all his past actions over these many millennia.  He could stay true to his Lord and creator.  He really could be part of saving the world.  Or...  Before he had been thoughtless or deceived, now he could choose.  He could stay the Angel of Good Intentions, or become the Angel of Regret.  Which was he?
			Rahserat went cold a second time, and the hammering at the doors abruptly stopped.  There was a further danger.  He knew his Lord as well as any could.  Rahserat had survived the betrayal of the Hidden Queen.  Perhaps only, he now wondered, because at the time he was unfallen.  Maybe the One really had helped him.  He had also escaped the god of Death.  He had been taken in by an archangel, and even given charge of her daughter.  He ruled a vast empire on Erebus, leading armies for the greater glory of... something.  Or did he?  He had been very, very fortunate.  But his Lord trusted no one, and in his vault casually played games with time and perception.  Esus toyed with dreams, and always twisted them.  The Risen Emperor might be emperor of only one of Esus' dreams.  And he'd never know, never know for sure, until he'd acted in any way that revealed himself.  Regret or Good Intentions.
			He could put it off, but there was no such thing as a non-decision.  Delay was something he could only... regret.  Rahserat knew he had to choose.

			A ringing and clattering shattered the quiet of the throne room as a hundred guardswomen all fell as one.  The Emperor went still and cold.  Finally, he understood what she meant.  
			Everything:   Nemed's trials, Mammon speaking before the assembled ranks, the War, the Compact, flashed through his mind.  Iaegus' pointed cruelties.  Esus' plots and plans.  The God of Deception.  And Trust. 
			Rahserat had acted only as he thought was best for the world.  He had gone against the revealed will of the One, yes, but he had acted only with the best of intentions.  It was a minor precept, but he'd never abandoned it!  Never corrupted it.  He had been deceived, or at least led astray, but he had never abandoned his precept.  He had never fallen.
			In a bright land, on a bright throne, in a room where a hundred identical women lie unconscious, with the guards outside hammering on the door, desperate to know if their Emperor is safe, their Emperor doubts his safety.
			He had never fallen.  But now he could.  He had been persuaded, before.  He had been mistaken.  Even an angel, obeying his purpose, can be twisted around that purpose.  Yet from the moment he'd realized that no fall was behind him, a gulf opened before him.  He could stay consistent with all his past actions over these many millennia.  He could stay true to his Lord and creator.  He really could be part of saving the world.  Or...  Before he had been thoughtless or deceived, now he could choose.  He could stay the Angel of Good Intentions, or become the Angel of Regret.  Which was he?
			Rahserat went cold a second time, and the hammering at the doors abruptly stopped.  There was a further danger.  He knew his Lord as well as any could.  Rahserat had survived the betrayal of the Hidden Queen.  Perhaps only, he now wondered, because at the time he was unfallen.  Maybe the One really had helped him.  He had also escaped the god of Death.  He had been taken in by an archangel, and even given charge of her daughter.  He ruled a vast empire on Erebus, leading armies for the greater glory of... something.  Or did he?  He had been very, very fortunate.  But his Lord trusted no one, and in his vault casually played games with time and perception.  Esus toyed with dreams, and always twisted them.  The Risen Emperor might be emperor of only one of Esus' dreams.  And he'd never know, never know for sure, until he'd acted in any way that revealed himself.  Regret or Good Intentions.
			He could put it off, but there was no such thing as a non-decision.  Delay was something he could only... regret.  Rahserat knew he had to choose.</German>

He remembers taking Korinna's stone knives and driving them through the Ivory Gate.  They sank into the softer stone behind the open door, pinning it open.  He remembers the first expeditions beyond the Gate, into what was now called the Bottomless Tomb.  In his absence the dead got on with their weird, slow dreaming, and had to be enticed out with offerings and pleadings.  The Emperor, Rahserat, wondered just how much of their living existence they spent dreaming.  If they never really stopped and only met each other only where their dreams intersected.  Whether they ever really lived in the deciphered world.
			They never dreamed in the vaults of Agares and his allies.  Maybe thats what hell was, to have imposed on you the dreams of others.
			But for an angel the dreaming-that-is-memory must eventually give way to action.  To decision.  Now he wanted a messenger, and one of his guards left to summon one.  Another brought pen, ink, and vellum.  When the agent stood before him Rahserat had a scroll ready.  There would be a new campaign, and it was time for the opening of the way.  From the end of creation, through the underworld, and into Erebus.  The Breach.

This was a critical time, a pivot, and whether or not the Scions declared now for the forces of rising Armageddon or waited, hoping for greater effect later, could decide the fate of the world.

He can feel his adopted people, alive in any significant sense, thriving and free on the face of Erebus. The barbarians to the south and east would fall soon enough, and emissaries were on their way from the "nations" to the north. They would be dealt with. And then west, to the sea, and [BOLD]through[\BOLD] the Sidar. Fools.[PARAGRAPH:1]The silent ones thought they revered Arawn. All they really worship is their idea of that dark god. Not only is he different from what they imagine, he might be more different than they can imagine. God of the Underworld, yes, but only warden of the Dreamlands. What is a god who cedes power and authority at every chance? Who's own chosen realm is a riot of freedom, rotting around him? Life, and Death. Absolute freedom and complete confinement. God of beginnings and endings. Neither light nor dark. The Gray One.[PARAGRAPH:1]He remembered the passage of that oppressive aura, and pressing himself tight against the dark stone. Fear spikes through him and he shifts on his throne. His bodyguards, circling the chamber, stir in turn, every woman's weapon glinting red and silver.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Sidar were right about his color, at least. Brighter than the night, but infinitely deeper. Gray. The emperor shudders, as if bitten by the cold he can never feel. The Hidden Queen had her secrets, but they could be revealed. The Gray One might be unknowable.[PARAGRAPH:1][ITALICS]"I know who you are, though you do not."[\ITALICS][PARAGRAPH:1]Her. How could she be his spawn? Sure compassion... and her brother raging anger. Maybe the twins were just the knowable portions of the God, exiled into the deciphered world.[PARAGRAPH:1]He knew his thoughts went in circles. They always did when he thought of his most successful mission. His Lord had never cloaked him better. Yet it hadn't been enough. Thinking was not the way through. The eyes of memory can never see aright in the dreamlands, only the eyes of dreams.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lights scattered over her black mantle like the stars, and following her through the twisting passages was like spinning up into a night sky that had suddenly abandoned Erebus for the void. Disoriented and lost beyond recovery should she betray him, Rahserat, the fallen Angel of Good Intentions, could only endure as the Hidden Queen guided him down the paths only she knew.[PARAGRAPH:1]Finally she halted by a doorway formed of three large bluestones, the horizontal one marked with an eye and a hand. "This is the one," she whispered. "Give me the password."[PARAGRAPH:1]"My Lord bade me tell you only after I stood safe and free within the Underworld."[PARAGRAPH:1]"This is the one. The Death God will know if I enter his realm. Give me the password."[PARAGRAPH:1]"I'm sorry, my lady, but I carry my Lord's trust."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Don't mock me, Rahserat."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Never. But I have been given this," Rahserat produced a small yellow vial. "I will destroy it when I stand in Arawn's kingdom. The knowledge you want to be released to you then."[PARAGRAPH:1]"So." Her whisper was so soft he had to lean forward to catch her words. "And if you do not I will consider your Lord, and you, to have betrayed me."[PARAGRAPH:1]The angel said nothing. He'd been warned against speaking to her more than was absolutely necessary. He merely bowed. She hissed, and gestured at the doorway. He stepped through it.[PARAGRAPH:1]After that it was hard to put things in chronological order. Later he wondered if his own realm drove the Death God insane. Where a human found infinite freedom, bounded only by his own mind and preconceptions, what would the unbounded mind of a god find? It was hard enough being an angel.[PARAGRAPH:1]But he did his master's bidding, working for the downfall of the One and a better world beyond.[PARAGRAPH:1]First he used the vial. Then, cloaked as one of the angels appropriate to this place, Rahserat moved through the dreamlands. He persuaded, he tempted, he cajoled. He ministered to the souls, always playing off their better nature and always guiding them back toward ambition. This kingdom of the most uncaring god was naturally a place of stillness, where the unguided dead lost themselves. And though he did not specifically direct their re-awakened ambitions - that could too easily invite scrutiny - he knew where striving would necessarily lead them: The new center of the dreamlands, the anti-deity Laroth. That Spirit master collected the newly aware dead into an army. An army to challenge the reigning Death God. Even if Laroth was doomed, his plotting weakened Arawn's hold over the underworld and especially his angels. If the grandiose plan succeeded Rahserat didn't know if Laroth would be any better an ally for his Lord than the Hidden Queen. But it would remove a god who stood with the One.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rahserat avoided the Forsaken Palace, Arawn's seldom-occupied center of power. Yet as he moved among that god's angels some show of participating in their increasingly disorganized and apathetically pursued work had to be maintained. Thus at times he walked the basalt and chalk halls, trapped for days, sometimes longer, in elaborate games of etiquette and influence. The dead-eyed black-and-white patterned angels that formed the palace guard and inner-administration, called phantoms, were unwaveringly loyal to the Grey One. Every other angel was suspect. Rahserat had to play a careful game both with those of certain loyalty and with those who might be Laroth's minions. But his Lord's cloak, his assumed identity, always held. Or, really, lack of identity. He started thinking of himself as the Other Angel. Never Rahserat. Never the angel he spoke to, or one that angel had just seen or spoken with. Always someone else. The Other Angel.[PARAGRAPH:1]Even when he escaped the Palace a feeling of self-alienation didn't leave him. Mirrors began haunting him. Usually empty, but sometimes they showed Laroth. Even Basium, whose thundering could sometimes be heard throughout the underworld, at least by an angel, would be clever enough to understand. What did Rahserat do so differently from Laroth? Both twisted the spirit or soul out of true, both always using something within the spirit or soul to do so. Laroth did so for personal gain, while Rahserat helped topple empires for his Lord, and thus for all of creation. But still the mirrors haunted. Rather than spinning a dream he could inhabit Rahserat felt he was unraveling himself, weaving a new Rahserat. One who took souls supposedly safe within the underworld and drove them on. Hell, the great machine that was Agares' greatest triumph, now reached here. Thanks to Rahserat. It was better than utter destruction, but the world would pay a great price to withstand the One.[PARAGRAPH:1]Even with angelic memory he couldn't know when it happened, on which sortie into the Palace it occurred. But while transversing a black stone gallery above the entrance hall Rahserat felt the arrival of the Death God. There was a pull, or a calling. Maybe it was what mortality felt like? But it was irresistible, and all eyes went to the Twilight Portal.[PARAGRAPH:1]A guard of phantoms assembled along the wide, descending stairway from the great doors. Their black and white ribbons hung limp, stirring only when they turned, as one, to face the Portal. Two were already by the doors and pulling on the great rings, swinging wide the doors and revealing the Grey One.[PARAGRAPH:1]Stern and aloof, he loomed in the open doorway like a thundercloud. Fine clothes, with both tunic and pants of a rich, thick cloth. But everything only in shades of grey. Pale silver from the lining and jet rings on the hands were the only adornments. And, like a cloud, he dimmed light in his presence. The phantoms at the doors prostrated themselves. Uncaring, the Death God passed them and descended the stairway. Each phantom going to one knee as he strode by. A wave of ribbons in absolute hues fooled the eye, blending and seeming still even as they rippled with the sudden motion. 	So flanked by motionless movement, by black and white mixed to grey, by the bowed heads of servants utterly loyal and completely unacknowledged, Arawn entered his palace.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rahserat should have fled when he first felt the god. He had no wish to test his masks against the Grey One himself. But Arawn could never be avoided indefinitely. And Arawn was already walking up the gallery.[PARAGRAPH:1]The illicit angel pressed himself into an alcove carved directly from the basalt. Fighting an urge to run Rahserat went to his knees, bowing toward the walkway, and then went still. The footsteps of the Death God and his retinue were the only sounds, and they were coming closer. Then they were before him, and died away. Hearing nothing, knowing Arawn stood before him, Rahserat looked up.[PARAGRAPH:1][ITALICS]"Who are [BOLD]you?[\BOLD]"[\ITALICS][PARAGRAPH:1]Suddenly unable to see, the god's demand hit Rahserat like a hammer blow. Was this how Iaegus fell? The angel felt like he might be crushed, caught between the god's pull and the need to escape. He choked back a damning response and concentrated on his Lord's precept.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Arawn turned his head Rahserat could see again. The god spoke to someone beside him.[PARAGRAPH:1][ITALICS]"It hardly matters. Give him to your brother. Whatever's necessary should be done."[\ITALICS][PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, Arawn. I will see to what's needed."[PARAGRAPH:1]The god walked on, leaving Rahserat with an angel of female aspect. Pale, with long hair utterly black, and wearing pure white. She looked after the god until that one, never glancing back or even to the side, had turned a corner. Then she beckoned Rahserat with a gesture. "Stand."[PARAGRAPH:1]No, she wasn't an angel. She possessed too strong an aura. An archangel.[PARAGRAPH:1]A pair of phantoms waited at her side, one with a spear and one with chains. "You may go. This one is no threat to me. You," she gestured to Rahserat again. "You will come with me."[PARAGRAPH:1]The phantoms followed their god, and Gyra suddenly took Rahserat's face in her hands, seizing him with her eyes. "I will not give you to my brother. I will not even see you driven from this place. For you have work to do."[PARAGRAPH:1]Her eyes blazed, lit by something Rahserat thought he'd seen before, but had long since forgotten. "You see, little angel, [ITALICS]I know who you are, though you do not."[\ITALICS][PARAGRAPH:1]Gyra took him from the Forsaken Palace and to her own places on the edge of the underworld. She showed him many things. Though it was properly in the keeping of her brother, she showed him an unguarded and secret way into Erebus: The Ivory Gate. She showed him better ways to bend others to his will. She could wield compassion like a knife, a knife she gave to him. She took him into her home and introduced him to her daughter, and he though she said nothing he thought he saw a father beyond the daughter: A one-handed man with stars for eyes.[PARAGRAPH:1]And never did she remonstrate with him for his deceptions, for sending more souls on to fallen Spirit master, one who he knew she worked to stop. All of this surprised him. Especially the daughter, Korinna. But nothing shocked him like the false Laroth.[PARAGRAPH:1]They stood on a cliff somehow high above the dreamlands. "Arawn made this place, to more easily survey his domain. My brother cares for other things and never came here, and Arawn comes here seldom now. But still, we shouldn't linger. I have something to show you, then a place for us to go. Come and see."[PARAGRAPH:1]He stepped to the edge and looked where she pointed. "There," she said. "Use your eyes, angel, and look upon the false new kingdom!"[PARAGRAPH:1]It was subtle, but a part of the dreamland, the inhabited underworld, seemed organized. It flowed like the rest, but some dreams stayed apart, mixing only among each other. Reading the flow for pattern, Rahserat looked for that pattern's source. There  a center. A huge hall, like an ivory vault. Mortals of all sorts at its walls and in the center a man with a mirrored crown. The would-be god, Laroth.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gyra touched his shoulder and Rahserat's gaze was torn from the distance. Then the archangel's pointing finger commanded his attention in a new direction. There he spied another seed of order within the dreamland's chaos. Another pattern. This one was smaller, and even more subtle. Furtive might have been a better word. At its center another hall, empty this time. But there was another throne. And on this throne..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"You look upon the new false kingdom, Rahserat. Now: Come and see."[PARAGRAPH:1]Gyra took Rahserat's hand, effortlessly lifting him with her as she rose above the cliff. Then, moving them in her own manner across the dreamland, Rahserat suddenly stood before the second throne. And the second Laroth.[PARAGRAPH:1]The features were the same, and the crown. But rather than empty pits a cloth band of arterial red covered the eyes.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rahserat turned his puzzled face toward the archangel. "Another Laroth?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Gyra nodded. "A false one. Most of the souls you stir come to him. Especially the Patrians. Pelemoc, for example, is already here."[PARAGRAPH:1]"But who is he?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"He is what the mirrors show you. Yourself. Even angels build from dreams here. That's why Arawn has taken them from the angels at the palace. And maybe why..." She shook her head, midnight tresses covering her face for a moment, clearly changing her mind about what she'd been about to say. Continuing, she said "And this is your dream. Or nightmare, I don't know. But this is what you thought you might be. Just like Laroth, but of course you'd rather not just feed his power. Here is your own power base. Souls have been gathering here just as they have around Laroth's throne. But the false Laroth, unlike the other, is [ITALICS]completely[\ITALICS] your creature. He holds the souls here in trust. He will commend them to you, to do with as you will. Let them join Laroth, or swear to your god. Or you may keep them for yourself."[PARAGRAPH:1]"This is an extravagant power you let him... let me possess. Even if it's far less than Laroth's. You oppose him, why do you aid me?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I told you, angel, I know who you are."[PARAGRAPH:1]She refused to explain what she meant, as always, but made Rahserat and herself visible, then introduced him to the false Laroth. The Other Angel. Just as she'd said, the dream-formed Laroth accepted Rahserat as his Lord without the slightest hesitation. He obeyed Rahserat in everything. Laroth summoned some of the lords of men he'd already gathered, introducing Rahserat as their Emperor. Pelemoc indeed was among them, as was Melante. More, the false Laroth told him, would be with him soon. And there were.[PARAGRAPH:1]The false Laroth could do the work he'd been sent for, and better. He suspected Gyra had a hand in his formation, but that was another subject on which she would not comment. Eventually Rahserat realized he wasn't needed, and should leave. Esus might not want the souls to go to the real Laroth if there were other options. And, if nothing else, they could be sold or traded to the hopeful usurper. His Lord knew the price of everything. Rahserat bade the false Laroth to send him a portion of the souls he snared. His Lord might find an immediate use for them, and they'd act as proof.[PARAGRAPH:1]His Lord was not trusting.[PARAGRAPH:1]Furthermore, Gyra offered him a secret way out of the underworld. The ways of the Hidden Queen were almost impossible to find, and dangerous even then. With his mission fulfilled Rahserat had planned seeking passage from Basium. One way or another. But that choleric archangel might see past his masks just as Arawn had. Gyra's charge was entrance to the underworld, but she knew of a few ways out. The Ivory Gate was one. Finally, most importantly, she had a favor to ask of him.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I want you to foster my daughter."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rahserat was sure he'd come to understand mortals far more since he'd arrived in the underworld. He'd had to act more furtively than ever before. He'd learned fear. He'd been discovered by one who stood to him as he stood to mortals. He'd learned defeat. And he, far older than most mortals could even comprehend, had been subjected to one surprise after another. This was another.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You want me to take Korinna?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes. She can't stay here. Despite my efforts she cannot... grow here. Erebus would be better for her. And she can open the Ivory Gate for you. She will go ahead, and is mortal enough to find it from the other side. It's the sure way."</English>
		<French>[H1]Dans une contrée prospère[\H1][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_1]Chapitre 1 : Dans une contrée prospère, l'Empereur Ressuscité[\LINK][NEWLINE]Chapitre 2 : Dans une contrée prospère, l'Éveillé[PARAGRAPH:2]Dans une contrée prospère, dans une ville blanche, dans une pièce sombre, un grand empereur est assis sur son trône doré, complotant. Il peut sentir son peuple adoptif, vivant d'après toutes les définitions, florissant et libre à la surface d'Erebus. Les barbares au sud et à l'est tomberaient bien assez tôt, et des émissaires étaient en chemin depuis les "nations" au nord. On s'en occuperait. Puis l'ouest, vers la mer, et [BOLD]à travers[\BOLD] les Sidarae. Imbéciles.[PARAGRAPH:1]Les silencieux pensaient qu'ils révéraient Arawn. Tout ce qu'ils vénèrent réellement est leur idée de ce dieu sombre. Il ne se contente pas d'être différent de ce qu'ils imaginent, il pourrait être plus différent que ce qu'ils peuvent imaginer. Dieu de l'Outremonde, certes, mais seulement gardien des Terres du Rêve. Qu'est-ce qu'un dieu qui cède pouvoir et autorité chaque fois qu'il le peut ? Dont le choix du royaume se porte sur un de lutte des libertés, pourrissant autour de lui ? Vie et Mort. Liberté absolue et confinement total. Dieu des débuts et des fins. Ni bon ni mauvais. Le Dieu Gris.[PARAGRAPH:1]Il se souvenait du moment dans cette zone oppressante, et se colla contre la pierre noire. Sentit la menace des lances et remua sur son trône. Ses gardes du corps, encerclèrent la chambre, se plaçant en cercle, chaque arme de ces femmes luisant de rouge et d'argent.[PARAGRAPH:1]Les Sidarae avaient au moins vu juste quant à sa couleur. Plus brillante que la nuit, mais infiniment plus profonde. Le Gris. L'Empereur frissonna, comme s'il était mordu par le froid qu'il ne pourrait jamais ressentir. La Reine Cachée avait ses secrets, mais ils pouvaient être révélés. Le Dieu Gris pouvait être impossible à appréhender.[PARAGRAPH:1][ITALICS]"Je sais qui tu es, même si toi tu ne le sais pas."[\ITALICS][PARAGRAPH:1]Elle. Comment pouvait elle être son engeance ? À coup sûr compatissante... et son frère empli d'une rage bouillonnante. Peut-être que les jumeaux n'étaient que des portions du Dieu que l'on peut appréhender, exilés dans ce monde de compréhension.[PARAGRAPH:1]Il savait que ses pensées tournaient en rond. Elles le faisaient chaque fois qu'il repensait à sa mission la plus fructueuse. Son Seigneur ne l'avait jamais si bien déguisé. Et pourtant ça n'avait pas été suffisant. Y penser n'arrangerait rien. Les yeux de la mémoire ne pouvaient jamais voir juste dans les Terres du Rêve. Seuls le pouvaient les yeux des rêves.[PARAGRAPH:1]Les lumières se dispersèrent sur son manteau noir comme autant d'étoiles, et la suivre dans les chemins tortueux était comme tourner sur soi sous un ciel étoilé qui aurait subitement abandonné Erebus pour le néant. Désorienté et perdu au-delà de ses capacités, elle aurait pu le trahir, lui, Rahserat, l'Ange déchu des Bonnes Intentions, et il ne pouvait que se laisser guider tandis que la Reine Cachée l'emmenait sur des chemins qu'elle seule connaissait.[PARAGRAPH:1]Elle s'arrêta finalement devant un encadrement de porte constitué de trois grosses pierres bleues, dont l'horizontale était marquée par un oeil et une main." "C'est ici," murmura-t-elle. "Donne moi le mot de passe."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Mon Seigneur m'a prié de ne te le dire qu'après m'être tenu sain et sauf dans l'Outremonde."[PARAGRAPH:1]"C'est ici. Le Dieu de la Mort le saura si j'entre dans son royaume. Donne moi le mot de passe."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Je suis désolé ma Dame, mais je suis la volonté de mon Seigneur."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ne te moque pas de moi, Rahserat."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Jamais. Mais on m'a donné ceci," et Rahserat sortit une petit fiole jaune. "Je la détruirai quand je me tiendrai dans le royaume d'Arawn. Ce que vous voulez savoir vous sera alors révélé."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Soit." Son murmure était si faible qu'il dût pencher la tête en avant pour saisir ses mots. "Et si tu ne le fais pas, je considèrerai que ton Seigneur et toi m'avez trahie."[PARAGRAPH:1]L'ange ne répondit rien. On l'avait prévenu de ne pas lui parler plus que ce qui était absolument nécessaire. Il s'inclina simplement. Elle siffla et montra l'embrasure. Il la traversa.[PARAGRAPH:1]Après ça, il était difficile de tout remettre dans l'ordre chronologique. Plus tard, il se demanda si son propre royaume n'avait pas rendu fou le Dieu de la Mort. Là où un humain trouvait une liberté infinie, limitée uniquement par ses idées préconçues et son propre esprit, que trouverait l'esprit illimité d'un dieu ? Il était déjà bien assez dur d'être un ange.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mais il réalisa la volonté de son maître, travaillant à la chute du Premier et à un meilleur monde derrière.[PARAGRAPH:1]Il utilisa d'abord la fiole. Puis, déguisé comme les anges adaptés à ce lieu, Rahserat se déplaça dans les Terres du Rêve. Il persuada, il tenta, il cajola. Il s'adressa aux âmes, toujours en usant du meilleur d'elles-mêmes et toujours en les replançant sur le chemin de l'ambition. Ce royaume du dieu le moins attentionné était naturellement un lieu d'immobilisme, où les morts laissés à eux-mêmes se perdent. Et bien qu'il ne guida pas spécifiquement leurs ambitions ressuscitées (ce qui attirerait trop facilement l'attention) il savait où leurs efforts les mèneraient : le nouveau centre des Terres du Rêve, l'anti-dieu Laroth. Ce maître esprit collectait les nouveaux morts conscients en une armée. Une armée pour défier le Dieu de la Mort. Même si Laroth était condamné, sa machination avait affaibli l'emprise d'Arawn sur l'outremonde et particulièrement ses anges. Si ce plan grandiose réussissait, Rahserat ne savait pas si Laroth serait un meilleur allié pour son Seigneur que la Reine Cachée. Mais il éliminerait un dieu de mèche avec le Premier.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rahserat évita le Palais Abandonné, le centre du pouvoir d'Arawn, rarement occupé. Pourtant, tandis qu'il se mouvait parmi les anges de ce dieu, certains montraient des velléités de participation à leur travail de plus en plus désorganisé et apathique qu'ils devaient pousuivre. Ainsi par moments, alors qu'il marchait dans les couloirs de basalte et de craie, il les voyait, piégés depuis des jours, parfois plus, dans des jeux élaborés d'étiquette et d'influence. Les anges aux yeux morts faits de motifs noirs et blancs qui formaient la garde du palais et de l'administration centrale, nommés fantômes, étaient fanatiquement loyaux au Dieu Gris. Tout autre ange était suspect. Rahserat jouait un jeu dangereux, en jouant à la fois avec ceux à la loyauté indéflectible et avec ceux qui pourraient être les pions de Laroth. Mais la couverture de son Seigneur, son identité avouée, a tenu bon. Ou plutôt son manque d'identité. Il commença à penser à lui comme l'Autre Ange. Jamais Rahserat. Jamais l'ange à qui il parlait, ou l'ange qu'il venait de voir ou à qui il venait de parler. Toujours quelqu'un d'autre. L'Autre Ange.[PARAGRAPH:1]Même après s'être échappé du Palais, un sentiment d'auto-aliénation ne le quitta pas. Les Miroirs commencèrent à le hanter. Généralement vides, mais parfois ils lui montraient Laroth. Même Basium, dont le tonnerre pouvait être parfois entendu au travers de l'outremonde, au moins par un ange, serait assez malin pour comprendre. Qu'est-ce que Rahserath avait fait de si différent par rapport à Laroth ? Les deux avaient détourné les ésprits ou les âmes de la vérité, et les deux utilisaient quelque chose à l'intérieur de l'eprit ou de l'âme pour y parvenir. Laroth l'avait fait pour son compte, tandis que Rahserat aidait à renverser des empires pour son Seigneur, et ainsi pour Création toute entière. Et pourtant les miroirs le hantaient. Plutôt que de tournoyer dans un rêve qu'il pourrait habiter, Rahserat sentit qu'il se démêlait, tissant un nouveau Rahserat. Celui qui prenait des âmes prétendument en sécurité au sein de l'outremonde et les guidait. L'enfer, la grande machine qui était le plus grand triomphe d'Agares, était arrivée. Grâce à Rahserat. C'était mieux qu'une destruction complète, mais le monde aurait à payer un prix exorbitant pour s'opposer au Premier.[PARAGRAPH:1]Même avec sa mémoire angélique il ne savait quand c'était arrivé, ni à quelle porte du Palais. Mais tandis qu'il parcourait une gallerie de pierre noire au-dessus de l'entrée, Rahserat ressentit l'arrivée du Dieu de la Mort. C'était un tiraillement, ou un appel. Peut-être la mortalité ressemblait-elle à ça ? Mais c'était irrésistible, et tous les yeux se tournèrent vers le Portail du Crépuscule. Une garde de fantômes s'assembla le long du large escalier qui descendait des grandes portes. Leurs rubans noir et blanc pendaient mollement, ne bougeant que lorsqu'ils se tournèrent, comme un seul, pour faire face au Portail. Deux d'entre eux étaient déjà aux portes en train de tirer sur les grands anneaux, ouvrant grand les portes et révélant le Dieu Gris.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sévère et distant, il se dessina dans l'encadrement de la porte comme un nuage orageux. Il portait de beaux vêtements, avec à la fois une tunique et un pantalon d'une étoffe riche et épaisse. Mais tout apparaissait en nuances de gris. De l'argent pâle aux doublures, et des anneaux de jais aux poignets étaient ses seules parures. Et tel un nuage il assombrissait la lumière de sa présence. Les fantômes aux portes se prosternèrent. Sans y prêter attention, le Dieu de la Mort passa à leur hauteur et descendit les escaliers. Chaque fantôme s'agenouillait à son passage. Un flot de rubans trompaient les yeux de leurs teintes absolues, s'assemblant et semblant statiques alors même qu'ils ondoyaient avec le mouvement soudain. C'est ainsi que, entouré par des mouvements 'immobiles', par du noir et du blanc mélangés au gris, par les têtes baissées de serviteurs absolument loyaux et totalement non reconnus, Arawn pénétra dans son Palais.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rahserat aurait dû fuir dès l'instant où il avait senti le dieu. Il n'avait pas envie de mettre son déguisement à l'épreuve fauce au Dieu Gris lui-même. Mais Arawn ne pourrait pas être évité indéfiniment. Et Arawn arpentait déjà la gallerie.[PARAGRAPH:1]L'ange intrus se précipita dans une alcôve creusée directement dans le basalte. Luttant contre l'envie de s'enfuir, Rahserat s'agenouilla, baissant la tête en direction du passage, et s'immobilisa. Les pas du Dieu de la Mort et de son entourage étaient les seuls sons, et ils s'approchaient. Puis ils passèrent devant lui, et moururent. N'entendant rien, sachant qu'Arawn se tenait devant lui, Rahserat leva les yeux.[PARAGRAPH:1][ITALICS]"Qui es-[BOLD]tu ?[\BOLD]"[\ITALICS][PARAGRAPH:1]Soudainement incapable de voir, Rahserat encaissa la demande du dieu comme un coup de marteau. Était-ce ce qu'avait ressenti Iaegus ? L'ange eut l'impression qu'il pouvait être broyé, pris entre l'attraction du dieu et le besoin de s'enfuir. Il retint une réponse malheureuse et se concentra sur les enseignements de son Seigneur.[PARAGRAPH:1]Quand Arawn tourna la tête, Rahserat recouvra la vue. Le dieu parla à quelqu'un derrière lui.[PARAGRAPH:1][ITALICS]"Ça n'a pas d'importance. Donne le à ton frère. Et que tout ce qui est nécessaire soit fait."[\ITALICS][PARAGRAPH:1]"Oui, Arawn. Je me renseignerai sur ce qui est nécessaire."[PARAGRAPH:1]Arawn recommenca à marcher, laissa Rahserat avec un ange d'aspect féminin. Pâle, avec de longs cheveux totalement noirs, et habillée de blanc immaculé. Elle regarda le dieu jusqu'à ce que ce dernier, sans jeter un regard en arrière ou même sur les côtés, tourne à un coin. Puis elle fit un signe de la main à l'attention de Rahserat. "Lève-toi."[PARAGRAPH:1]Non, elle n'était pas un ange. Son aura était trop puissante. Un archange.[PARAGRAPH:1]Deux fantômes attendaient à ses côtés, l'un équipé d'un lance et l'autre de chaînes. "Vous pouvez nous laisser. Il ne représente pas une menace pour moi. Toi," elle à nouveau signe à Rahserat. "Tu viens avec moi."[PARAGRAPH:1]Les fantômes suivirent leur dieu, et Gyra prit soudainement le visage de Rahserat dans ses mains, le vrillant du regard. "Je ne te donnerai pas à mon frère. Je ne te ferai même pas sortir d'ici. Car tu as un travail à accomplir."[PARAGRAPH:1]Ses yeux flamboyèrent, illuminés par quelque chose que Rahserat pensait avoir déjà vu auparavant, mais avait oublié depuis longtemps. "Tu vois, petit ange, [ITALICS]je sais qui tu es, même si toi tu ne le sais pas."[\ITALICS][PARAGRAPH:1]Gyra le fit sortir du Palais Abandonné et l'amena dans ses terres aux confins de l'outremonde. Elle lui montra maintes choses. Même s'il était sous la surveillance de son frère, elle lui montra un passage secret non gardé pour entrer en Erebus : la Porte d'Ivoire. Elle lui montra de meilleures techniques pour soumettre les autres à sa volonté. Elle pouvait user de compassion comme d'un couteau, un couteau dont elle lui fit don. Elle l'amena chez elle et le présenta à sa fille, et même si elle ne dit rien, il crut deviner un père derrière la fille : un homme manchot avec des étoiles à la place des yeux.[PARAGRAPH:1]Et jamais elle ne lui reprocha ses trahisons, d'avoir envoyé plus d'âmes au maître Esprit, celui qu'elle cherchait à arrêter. Tout ceci le surprit. Particulièrement la fille, Korinna. Mais rien ne le choqua plus que le faux Laroth. Ils se tenaient sur une falaise assez haute au-dessus des terres du rêve. "Arawn a construit cet endroit pour pouvoir surveiller son domaine plus aisément. Mon frère s'occupe d'autres choses et ne vient jamais ici, et Arawn y vient maintenant rarement. Mais nous ne devrions pas traîner. Je dois te montrer quelque chose, puis un endroit où nous devons aller. Approche et observe."[PARAGRAPH:1]Il s'approcha du bord et regarda dans la direction qu'elle pointait. "Là," dit-elle. "Utilise tes yeux, ange, et observe le faux nouveau royaume !"[PARAGRAPH:1]C'était subtil, mais une portion des terres du rêve, l'outremonde inhabité, semblait organisé. Ça se mouvait, comme le reste, mais certains rêves restaient isolés, ne se mélangeant qu'entre eux. Discernant un schéma derrière les courants, Rahserat remonta vers la source de ce schéma. Là : un centre. Un énorme hall, comme une arche d'ivoire. Des mortels de toutes sortes sur les murs et au centre un homme avec une couronne de miroirs. Le simili-dieu, Laroth.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gyra toucha son épaule et le regard de Rahserat redevint proche. Puis le doigt pointé de l'archange attira son attention dans une nouvelle direction. Il y aperçut une nouvelle graine d'ordre au sein du chaos des terres du rêve. Un aurte schéma. Celui-là était plus petit, et encore plus subtil. Furtif aurait été plus adapté. Au centre, un autre hall, vide celui-là. Mais il y avait un autre trône. Et sur ce trône..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Tu observes là le nouveau faux royaume, Rahserat. Maintenant, approche et observe."[PARAGRAPH:1]Gyra prit la main de Rahserat, et le souleva sans effort tandis qu'elle s'élevait au-dessus de la falaise. Puis, les déplaçant selon son bon vouloir au-dessus des terres du rêve, Rahserat se retrouva soudainement devant le second trône. Et le second Laroth.[PARAGRAPH:1]Les traits étaient les mêmes, ainsi que la couronne. Mais à la place des orbites vides, un bandeau de tissu d'un rouge veineux couvrait les yeux.[PARAGRAPH:1]Perplexe, Rahserat se tourna vers l'archange. "Un autre Laroth ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Gyra acquiesca. "Un faux. La plupart des âmes que tu affectes vont à lui. Particulièrement les Patriens. Pelemoc, par exemple, est déjà là."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Mais qui est-il ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Il est ce que les miroirs te montrent. Toi. Même les anges se construisent grâce aux rêves ici. C'est pourquoi Arawn les a otés des anges du palais. Et probablement pourquoi..." Elle secoua la tête, ses cheveux noirs comme la nuit couvrant son visage pendant un instant, changeant clairement d'avis à propos de ce qu'elle s'apprêtait à lui dire. Poursuivant, elle dit "Et ceci est ton rêve. Ou ton cauchemar, je ne sais pas. Mais ceci est ce que tu crois pouvoir être. De même que Laroth, mais bien sûr tu ferais mieux de ne pas juste renforcer son pouvoir. Ceci est ta propre source de puissance. Les âmes se sont rassemblées ici comme elles le font autour du trône de Laroth. Mais le faux Laroth, à l'inverse de l'autre, est [ITALICS]totalement[\ITALICS] ta créature. Il contrôle les âmes présentes par la confiance. Il les commandera, pour agir selon ton bon plaisir. Laisse les rejoindre Laroth, ou se rallier à ton dieu. Ou tu peux les conserver pour toi-même."[PARAGRAPH:1]"C'est un pouvoir énorme que tu le laisses... me laisses posséder. Même s'il est bien moindre que celui de Laroth. Tu le combats, pourquoi m'aider ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Je te l'ai dit, ange, je sais qui tu es."[PARAGRAPH:1]Elle refusa de s'expliquer, comme toujours, mais se rendit visible de même que Rahserat, puis le présenta au faux Laroth. L'Autre Ange. Comme elle l'avait dit, le Laroth issu des rêves accepta Rahserat comme son Seigneur sans la moindre hésitation. Il obéit à tout ordre de Rahserat. Laroth invoqua certains des seigneurs des hommes qu'il avait déjà récoltés, et présenta Rahserat comme leur Empereur. Pelemoc était effectivement parmi eux, tout comme Melante. De plus, le faux Laroth lui parlerait, serait bientôt avec lui. Et ils le furent. Le faux Laroth pouvait réaliser le travail qu'on lui assignait, et plus encore. Il suspecta Gyra d'avoir pris part à sa formation, mais c'était un autre sujet qu'elle refusait d'aborder. Finalement, Rahserat réalisa que sa présence n'était pas nécessaire, et qu'il devrait partir. Esus pourrait ne pas vouloir que les âmes aillent au vrai Laroth s'il existait une autre option. Et, à défaut, elles pourraient être vendues ou échangées au profit de l'usurpateur plein d'espoir. Son Seigneur connaissait le prix de chaque chose. Rahserat demanda au faux Laroth de lui donner une partie des âmes qu'il avait piégées. Son Seigneur pourrait leur trouver une utilité immédiate, et elles pourraient faire office de preuve.[PARAGRAPH:1]Son Seigneur n'était pas confiant.[PARAGRAPH:1]en outre, Gyra lui offrit un échappatoire secret de l'outremonde. Les voies de la Reine Cachée étaient presque impossible à trouver, et restaient de toutes les façons dangereuses. Sa mission remplie, Rahserat pensait ensuite rechercher un passage vers Basium. D'une manière ou d'une autre. Mais cet archange colérique pourrait perçer ses masques à jour comme Arawn l'avait fait. Le périmètre de Gyra était l'accès à l'outremonde, mais elle connaissait quelques sorties. La Porte d'Ivoire en était une. Enfin, et c'était le plus important, elle avait une faveur à lui demander.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Je veux que tu adoptes ma fille."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rahserat était sûr de pouvoir bien mieux comprendre les mortels depuis qu'il était arrivé dans l'outremonde. Il avait dû agir bien plus discrètement qu'avant. Il avait appris la peur. Il avait été découvert par quelqu'un qui le considérait comme il considérait les mortels. Il avait appris la défaite. Et lui, bien plus vieux que ce que la plupart des mortels pourraient imaginer, avait été de surprise en surprise. Ceci en était une autre.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Vous voulez que j'emmène Korinna ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Oui. Elle ne peut pas rester ici. Malgré mes efforts elle ne peut pas... grandir ici. Erebus devrait être mieux pour elle. Et elle peut ouvrir la Porte d'Ivoire pour toi. Elle passera devant, et est assez mortelle pour la trouver depuis l'autre côté. C'est la solution la plus sûre."[NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_3]Chapitre 3 : Dans une contrée prospère, Korinna[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_4]Chapitre 4 : Dans une contrée prospère, la Cathédrale de la Renaissance[\LINK]</French>

The barbarians to the south and east would fall soon enough, and emissaries were on their way from the "nations" to the north. They would be dealt with. And then west, to the sea, and [BOLD]through[\BOLD] the Sidar. Fools.[PARAGRAPH:1]The silent ones thought they revered Arawn. All they really worship is their idea of that dark god. Not only is he different from what they imagine, he might be more different than they can imagine. God of the Underworld, yes, but only warden of the Dreamlands. What is a god who cedes power and authority at every chance? Who's own chosen realm is a riot of freedom, rotting around him? Life, and Death. Absolute freedom and complete confinement. God of beginnings and endings. Neither light nor dark. The Gray One.[PARAGRAPH:1]He remembered the passage of that oppressive aura, and pressing himself tight against the dark stone. Fear spikes through him and he shifts on his throne. His bodyguards, circling the chamber, stir in turn, every woman's weapon glinting red and silver.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Sidar were right about his color, at least. Brighter than the night, but infinitely deeper. Gray. The emperor shudders, as if bitten by the cold he can never feel. The Hidden Queen had her secrets, but they could be revealed. The Gray One might be unknowable.[PARAGRAPH:1]ITALICS]"I know who you are, though you do not."[\ITALICS][PARAGRAPH:1]Her. How could she be his spawn? Sure compassion... and her brother raging anger. Maybe the twins were just the knowable portions of the God, exiled into the deciphered world.[PARAGRAPH:1]He knew his thoughts went in circles. They always did when he thought of his most successful mission. His Lord had never cloaked him better. Yet it hadn't been enough. Thinking was not the way through. The eyes of memory can never see aright in the dreamlands, only the eyes of dreams.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lights scattered over her black mantle like the stars, and following her through the twisting passages was like spinning up into a night sky that had suddenly abandoned Erebus for the void. Disoriented and lost beyond recovery should she betray him, Rahserat, the fallen Angel of Good Intentions, could only endure as the Hidden Queen guided him down the paths only she knew.[PARAGRAPH:1]Finally she halted by a doorway formed of three large bluestones, the horizontal one marked with an eye and a hand. "This is the one," she whispered. "Give me the password."[PARAGRAPH:1]"My Lord bade me tell you only after I stood safe and free within the Underworld."[PARAGRAPH:1]"This is the one. The Death God will know if I enter his realm. Give me the password."[PARAGRAPH:1]"I'm sorry, my lady, but I carry my Lord's trust."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Don't mock me, Rahserat."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Never. But I have been given this," Rahserat produced a small yellow vial. "I will destroy it when I stand in Arawn's kingdom. The knowledge you want to be released to you then."[PARAGRAPH:1]"So." Her whisper was so soft he had to lean forward to catch her words. "And if you do not I will consider your Lord, and you, to have betrayed me."[PARAGRAPH:1]The angel said nothing. He'd been warned against speaking to her more than was absolutely necessary. He merely bowed. She hissed, and gestured at the doorway. He stepped through it.[PARAGRAPH:1]After that it was hard to put things in chronological order. Later he wondered if his own realm drove the Death God insane. Where a human found infinite freedom, bounded only by his own mind and preconceptions, what would the unbounded mind of a god find? It was hard enough being an angel.[PARAGRAPH:1]But he did his master's bidding, working for the downfall of the One and a better world beyond.[PARAGRAPH:1]First he used the vial. Then, cloaked as one of the angels appropriate to this place, Rahserat moved through the dreamlands. He persuaded, he tempted, he cajoled. He ministered to the souls, always playing off their better nature and always guiding them back toward ambition. This kingdom of the most uncaring god was naturally a place of stillness, where the unguided dead lost themselves. And though he did not specifically direct their re-awakened ambitions - that could too easily invite scrutiny - he knew where striving would necessarily lead them: The new center of the dreamlands, the anti-deity Laroth. That Spirit master collected the newly aware dead into an army. An army to challenge the reigning Death God. Even if Laroth was doomed, his plotting weakened Arawn's hold over the underworld and especially his angels. If the grandiose plan succeeded Rahserat didn't know if Laroth would be any better an ally for his Lord than the Hidden Queen. But it would remove a god who stood with the One.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rahserat avoided the Forsaken Palace, Arawn's seldom-occupied center of power. Yet as he moved among that god's angels some show of participating in their increasingly disorganized and apathetically pursued work had to be maintained. Thus at times he walked the basalt and chalk halls, trapped for days, sometimes longer, in elaborate games of etiquette and influence. The dead-eyed black-and-white patterned angels that formed the palace guard and inner-administration, called phantoms, were unwaveringly loyal to the Grey One. Every other angel was suspect. Rahserat had to play a careful game both with those of certain loyalty and with those who might be Laroth's minions. But his Lord's cloak, his assumed identity, always held. Or, really, lack of identity. He started thinking of himself as the Other Angel. Never Rahserat. Never the angel he spoke to, or one that angel had just seen or spoken with. Always someone else. The Other Angel.[PARAGRAPH:1]Even when he escaped the Palace a feeling of self-alienation didn't leave him. Mirrors began haunting him. Usually empty, but sometimes they showed Laroth. Even Basium, whose thundering could sometimes be heard throughout the underworld, at least by an angel, would be clever enough to understand. What did Rahserat do so differently from Laroth? Both twisted the spirit or soul out of true, both always using something within the spirit or soul to do so. Laroth did so for personal gain, while Rahserat helped topple empires for his Lord, and thus for all of creation. But still the mirrors haunted. Rather than spinning a dream he could inhabit Rahserat felt he was unraveling himself, weaving a new Rahserat. One who took souls supposedly safe within the underworld and drove them on. Hell, the great machine that was Agares' greatest triumph, now reached here. Thanks to Rahserat. It was better than utter destruction, but the world would pay a great price to withstand the One.[PARAGRAPH:1]Even with angelic memory he couldn't know when it happened, on which sortie into the Palace it occurred. But while transversing a black stone gallery above the entrance hall Rahserat felt the arrival of the Death God. There was a pull, or a calling. Maybe it was what mortality felt like? But it was irresistible, and all eyes went to the Twilight Portal.[PARAGRAPH:1]A guard of phantoms assembled along the wide, descending stairway from the great doors. Their black and white ribbons hung limp, stirring only when they turned, as one, to face the Portal. Two were already by the doors and pulling on the great rings, swinging wide the doors and revealing the Grey One.[PARAGRAPH:1]Stern and aloof, he loomed in the open doorway like a thundercloud. Fine clothes, with both tunic and pants of a rich, thick cloth. But everything only in shades of grey. Pale silver from the lining and jet rings on the hands were the only adornments. And, like a cloud, he dimmed light in his presence. The phantoms at the doors prostrated themselves. Uncaring, the Death God passed them and descended the stairway. Each phantom going to one knee as he strode by. A wave of ribbons in absolute hues fooled the eye, blending and seeming still even as they rippled with the sudden motion. 	So flanked by motionless movement, by black and white mixed to grey, by the bowed heads of servants utterly loyal and completely unacknowledged, Arawn entered his palace.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rahserat should have fled when he first felt the god. He had no wish to test his masks against the Grey One himself. But Arawn could never be avoided indefinitely. And Arawn was already walking up the gallery.[PARAGRAPH:1]The illicit angel pressed himself into an alcove carved directly from the basalt. Fighting an urge to run Rahserat went to his knees, bowing toward the walkway, and then went still. The footsteps of the Death God and his retinue were the only sounds, and they were coming closer. Then they were before him, and died away. Hearing nothing, knowing Arawn stood before him, Rahserat looked up.[PARAGRAPH:1][ITALICS]"Who are [BOLD]you?[\BOLD]"[\ITALICS][PARAGRAPH:1]Suddenly unable to see, the god's demand hit Rahserat like a hammer blow. Was this how Iaegus fell? The angel felt like he might be crushed, caught between the god's pull and the need to escape. He choked back a damning response and concentrated on his Lord's precept.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Arawn turned his head Rahserat could see again. The god spoke to someone beside him.[PARAGRAPH:1][ITALICS]"It hardly matters. Give him to your brother. Whatever's necessary should be done."[\ITALICS][PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, Arawn. I will see to what's needed."[PARAGRAPH:1]The god walked on, leaving Rahserat with an angel of female aspect. Pale, with long hair utterly black, and wearing pure white. She looked after the god until that one, never glancing back or even to the side, had turned a corner. Then she beckoned Rahserat with a gesture. "Stand."[PARAGRAPH:1]No, she wasn't an angel. She possessed too strong an aura. An archangel.[PARAGRAPH:1]A pair of phantoms waited at her side, one with a spear and one with chains. "You may go. This one is no threat to me. You," she gestured to Rahserat again. "You will come with me."[PARAGRAPH:1]The phantoms followed their god, and Gyra suddenly took Rahserat's face in her hands, seizing him with her eyes. "I will not give you to my brother. I will not even see you driven from this place. For you have work to do."[PARAGRAPH:1]Her eyes blazed, lit by something Rahserat thought he'd seen before, but had long since forgotten. "You see, little angel, [ITALICS]I know who you are, though you do not."[\ITALICS][PARAGRAPH:1]Gyra took him from the Forsaken Palace and to her own places on the edge of the underworld. She showed him many things. Though it was properly in the keeping of her brother, she showed him an unguarded and secret way into Erebus: The Ivory Gate. She showed him better ways to bend others to his will. She could wield compassion like a knife, a knife she gave to him. She took him into her home and introduced him to her daughter, and he though she said nothing he thought he saw a father beyond the daughter: A one-handed man with stars for eyes.[PARAGRAPH:1]And never did she remonstrate with him for his deceptions, for sending more souls on to fallen Spirit master, one who he knew she worked to stop. All of this surprised him. Especially the daughter, Korinna. But nothing shocked him like the false Laroth.[PARAGRAPH:1]They stood on a cliff somehow high above the dreamlands. "Arawn made this place, to more easily survey his domain. My brother cares for other things and never came here, and Arawn comes here seldom now. But still, we shouldn't linger. I have something to show you, then a place for us to go. Come and see."[PARAGRAPH:1]He stepped to the edge and looked where she pointed. "There," she said. "Use your eyes, angel, and look upon the false new kingdom!"[PARAGRAPH:1]It was subtle, but a part of the dreamland, the inhabited underworld, seemed organized. It flowed like the rest, but some dreams stayed apart, mixing only among each other. Reading the flow for pattern, Rahserat looked for that pattern's source. There  a center. A huge hall, like an ivory vault. Mortals of all sorts at its walls and in the center a man with a mirrored crown. The would-be god, Laroth.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gyra touched his shoulder and Rahserat's gaze was torn from the distance. Then the archangel's pointing finger commanded his attention in a new direction. There he spied another seed of order within the dreamland's chaos. Another pattern. This one was smaller, and even more subtle. Furtive might have been a better word. At its center another hall, empty this time. But there was another throne. And on this throne..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"You look upon the new false kingdom, Rahserat. Now: Come and see."[PARAGRAPH:1]Gyra took Rahserat's hand, effortlessly lifting him with her as she rose above the cliff. Then, moving them in her own manner across the dreamland, Rahserat suddenly stood before the second throne. And the second Laroth.[PARAGRAPH:1]The features were the same, and the crown. But rather than empty pits a cloth band of arterial red covered the eyes.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rahserat turned his puzzled face toward the archangel. "Another Laroth?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Gyra nodded. "A false one. Most of the souls you stir come to him. Especially the Patrians. Pelemoc, for example, is already here."[PARAGRAPH:1]"But who is he?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"He is what the mirrors show you. Yourself. Even angels build from dreams here. That's why Arawn has taken them from the angels at the palace. And maybe why..." She shook her head, midnight tresses covering her face for a moment, clearly changing her mind about what she'd been about to say. Continuing, she said "And this is your dream. Or nightmare, I don't know. But this is what you thought you might be. Just like Laroth, but of course you'd rather not just feed his power. Here is your own power base. Souls have been gathering here just as they have around Laroth's throne. But the false Laroth, unlike the other, is [ITALICS]completely[\ITALICS] your creature. He holds the souls here in trust. He will commend them to you, to do with as you will. Let them join Laroth, or swear to your god. Or you may keep them for yourself."[PARAGRAPH:1]"This is an extravagant power you let him... let me possess. Even if it's far less than Laroth's. You oppose him, why do you aid me?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I told you, angel, I know who you are."[PARAGRAPH:1]She refused to explain what she meant, as always, but made Rahserat and herself visible, then introduced him to the false Laroth. The Other Angel. Just as she'd said, the dream-formed Laroth accepted Rahserat as his Lord without the slightest hesitation. He obeyed Rahserat in everything. Laroth summoned some of the lords of men he'd already gathered, introducing Rahserat as their Emperor. Pelemoc indeed was among them, as was Melante. More, the false Laroth told him, would be with him soon. And there were.[PARAGRAPH:1]The false Laroth could do the work he'd been sent for, and better. He suspected Gyra had a hand in his formation, but that was another subject on which she would not comment. Eventually Rahserat realized he wasn't needed, and should leave. Esus might not want the souls to go to the real Laroth if there were other options. And, if nothing else, they could be sold or traded to the hopeful usurper. His Lord knew the price of everything. Rahserat bade the false Laroth to send him a portion of the souls he snared. His Lord might find an immediate use for them, and they'd act as proof.[PARAGRAPH:1]His Lord was not trusting.[PARAGRAPH:1]Furthermore, Gyra offered him a secret way out of the underworld. The ways of the Hidden Queen were almost impossible to find, and dangerous even then. With his mission fulfilled Rahserat had planned seeking passage from Basium. One way or another. But that choleric archangel might see past his masks just as Arawn had. Gyra's charge was entrance to the underworld, but she knew of a few ways out. The Ivory Gate was one. Finally, most importantly, she had a favor to ask of him.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I want you to foster my daughter."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rahserat was sure he'd come to understand mortals far more since he'd arrived in the underworld. He'd had to act more furtively than ever before. He'd learned fear. He'd been discovered by one who stood to him as he stood to mortals. He'd learned defeat. And he, far older than most mortals could even comprehend, had been subjected to one surprise after another. This was another.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You want me to take Korinna?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes. She can't stay here. Despite my efforts she cannot... grow here. Erebus would be better for her. And she can open the Ivory Gate for you. She will go ahead, and is mortal enough to find it from the other side. It's the sure way."</German>

The Other Angel. Just as she'd said, the dream-formed Laroth accepted Rahserat as his Lord without the slightest hesitation. He obeyed Rahserat in everything. Laroth summoned some of the lords of men he'd already gathered, introducing Rahserat as their Emperor. Pelemoc indeed was among them, as was Melante. More, the false Laroth told him, would be with him soon. And there were.[PARAGRAPH:1]The false Laroth could do the work he'd been sent for, and better. He suspected Gyra had a hand in his formation, but that was another subject on which she would not comment. Eventually Rahserat realized he wasn't needed, and should leave. Esus might not want the souls to go to the real Laroth if there were other options. And, if nothing else, they could be sold or traded to the hopeful usurper. His Lord knew the price of everything. Rahserat bade the false Laroth to send him a portion of the souls he snared. His Lord might find an immediate use for them, and they'd act as proof.[PARAGRAPH:1]His Lord was not trusting.[PARAGRAPH:1]Furthermore, Gyra offered him a secret way out of the underworld. The ways of the Hidden Queen were almost impossible to find, and dangerous even then. With his mission fulfilled Rahserat had planned seeking passage from Basium. One way or another. But that choleric archangel might see past his masks just as Arawn had. Gyra's charge was entrance to the underworld, but she knew of a few ways out. The Ivory Gate was one. Finally, most importantly, she had a favor to ask of him.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I want you to foster my daughter."[PARAGRAPH:1]Rahserat was sure he'd come to understand mortals far more since he'd arrived in the underworld. He'd had to act more furtively than ever before. He'd learned fear. He'd been discovered by one who stood to him as he stood to mortals. He'd learned defeat. And he, far older than most mortals could even comprehend, had been subjected to one surprise after another. This was another.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You want me to take Korinna?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes. She can't stay here. Despite my efforts she cannot... grow here. Erebus would be better for her. And she can open the Ivory Gate for you. She will go ahead, and is mortal enough to find it from the other side. It's the sure way."</Italian>
		<Spanish>[LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_1]Part 1: In a Bright Land[\LINK][NEWLINE]Part 2: In a Bright Land[NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_3]Part 3: In a Bright Land[\LINK][NEWLINE][LINK=LORE_BRIGHT_LAND_4]Part 4: In a Bright Land[\LINK][PARAGRAPH:2]In a bright land, in a white city, in a dark room a great emperor sits on his gold throne, plotting. He can feel his adopted people, alive in any significant sense, thriving and free on the face of Erebus. The barbarians to the south and east would fall soon enough, and emissaries were on their way from the "nations" to the north. They would be dealt with. And then west, to the sea, and [BOLD]through[\BOLD] the Sidar. Fools.[PARAGRAPH:1]The silent ones thought they revered Arawn. All they really worship is their idea of that dark god. Not only is he different from what they imagine, he might be more different than they can imagine. God of the Underworld, yes, but only warden of the Dreamlands. What is a god who cedes power and authority at every chance? Who's own chosen realm is a riot of freedom, rotting around him? Life, and Death. Absolute freedom and complete confinement. God of beginnings and endings. Neither light nor dark. The Gray One.[PARAGRAPH:1]He remembered the passage of that oppressive aura, and pressing himself tight against the dark stone. Fear spikes through him and he shifts on his throne. His bodyguards, circling the chamber, stir in turn, every woman's weapon glinting red and silver.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Sidar were right about his color, at least. Brighter than the night, but infinitely deeper. Gray. The emperor shudders, as if bitten by the cold he can never feel. The Hidden Queen had her secrets, but they could be revealed. The Gray One might be unknowable.[PARAGRAPH:1]ITALICS]"I know who you are, though you do not."[\ITALICS][PARAGRAPH:1]Her. How could she be his spawn? Sure compassion... and her brother raging anger. Maybe the twins were just the knowable portions of the God, exiled into the deciphered world.[PARAGRAPH:1]He knew his thoughts went in circles. They always did when he thought of his most successful mission. His Lord had never cloaked him better. Yet it hadn't been enough. Thinking was not the way through. The eyes of memory can never see aright in the dreamlands, only the eyes of dreams.[PARAGRAPH:1]Lights scattered over her black mantle like the stars, and following her through the twisting passages was like spinning up into a night sky that had suddenly abandoned Erebus for the void. Disoriented and lost beyond recovery should she betray him, Rahserat, the fallen Angel of Good Intentions, could only endure as the Hidden Queen guided him down the paths only she knew.[PARAGRAPH:1]Finally she halted by a doorway formed of three large bluestones, the horizontal one marked with an eye and a hand. "This is the one," she whispered. "Give me the password."[PARAGRAPH:1]"My Lord bade me tell you only after I stood safe and free within the Underworld."[PARAGRAPH:1]"This is the one. The Death God will know if I enter his realm. Give me the password."[PARAGRAPH:1]"I'm sorry, my lady, but I carry my Lord's trust."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Don't mock me, Rahserat."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Never. But I have been given this," Rahserat produced a small yellow vial. "I will destroy it when I stand in Arawn's kingdom. The knowledge you want to be released to you then."[PARAGRAPH:1]"So." Her whisper was so soft he had to lean forward to catch her words. "And if you do not I will consider your Lord, and you, to have betrayed me."[PARAGRAPH:1]The angel said nothing. He'd been warned against speaking to her more than was absolutely necessary. He merely bowed. She hissed, and gestured at the doorway. He stepped through it.[PARAGRAPH:1]After that it was hard to put things in chronological order. Later he wondered if his own realm drove the Death God insane. Where a human found infinite freedom, bounded only by his own mind and preconceptions, what would the unbounded mind of a god find? It was hard enough being an angel.[PARAGRAPH:1]But he did his master's bidding, working for the downfall of the One and a better world beyond.[PARAGRAPH:1]First he used the vial. Then, cloaked as one of the angels appropriate to this place, Rahserat moved through the dreamlands. He persuaded, he tempted, he cajoled. He ministered to the souls, always playing off their better nature and always guiding them back toward ambition. This kingdom of the most uncaring god was naturally a place of stillness, where the unguided dead lost themselves. And though he did not specifically direct their re-awakened ambitions - that could too easily invite scrutiny - he knew where striving would necessarily lead them: The new center of the dreamlands, the anti-deity Laroth. That Spirit master collected the newly aware dead into an army. An army to challenge the reigning Death God. Even if Laroth was doomed, his plotting weakened Arawn's hold over the underworld and especially his angels. If the grandiose plan succeeded Rahserat didn't know if Laroth would be any better an ally for his Lord than the Hidden Queen. But it would remove a god who stood with the One.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rahserat avoided the Forsaken Palace, Arawn's seldom-occupied center of power. Yet as he moved among that god's angels some show of participating in their increasingly disorganized and apathetically pursued work had to be maintained. Thus at times he walked the basalt and chalk halls, trapped for days, sometimes longer, in elaborate games of etiquette and influence. The dead-eyed black-and-white patterned angels that formed the palace guard and inner-administration, called phantoms, were unwaveringly loyal to the Grey One. Every other angel was suspect. Rahserat had to play a careful game both with those of certain loyalty and with those who might be Laroth's minions. But his Lord's cloak, his assumed identity, always held. Or, really, lack of identity. He started thinking of himself as the Other Angel. Never Rahserat. Never the angel he spoke to, or one that angel had just seen or spoken with. Always someone else. The Other Angel.[PARAGRAPH:1]Even when he escaped the Palace a feeling of self-alienation didn't leave him. Mirrors began haunting him. Usually empty, but sometimes they showed Laroth. Even Basium, whose thundering could sometimes be heard throughout the underworld, at least by an angel, would be clever enough to understand. What did Rahserat do so differently from Laroth? Both twisted the spirit or soul out of true, both always using something within the spirit or soul to do so. Laroth did so for personal gain, while Rahserat helped topple empires for his Lord, and thus for all of creation. But still the mirrors haunted. Rather than spinning a dream he could inhabit Rahserat felt he was unraveling himself, weaving a new Rahserat. One who took souls supposedly safe within the underworld and drove them on. Hell, the great machine that was Agares' greatest triumph, now reached here. Thanks to Rahserat. It was better than utter destruction, but the world would pay a great price to withstand the One.[PARAGRAPH:1]Even with angelic memory he couldn't know when it happened, on which sortie into the Palace it occurred. But while transversing a black stone gallery above the entrance hall Rahserat felt the arrival of the Death God. There was a pull, or a calling. Maybe it was what mortality felt like? But it was irresistible, and all eyes went to the Twilight Portal.[PARAGRAPH:1]A guard of phantoms assembled along the wide, descending stairway from the great doors. Their black and white ribbons hung limp, stirring only when they turned, as one, to face the Portal. Two were already by the doors and pulling on the great rings, swinging wide the doors and revealing the Grey One.[PARAGRAPH:1]Stern and aloof, he loomed in the open doorway like a thundercloud. Fine clothes, with both tunic and pants of a rich, thick cloth. But everything only in shades of grey. Pale silver from the lining and jet rings on the hands were the only adornments. And, like a cloud, he dimmed light in his presence. The phantoms at the doors prostrated themselves. Uncaring, the Death God passed them and descended the stairway. Each phantom going to one knee as he strode by. A wave of ribbons in absolute hues fooled the eye, blending and seeming still even as they rippled with the sudden motion. 	So flanked by motionless movement, by black and white mixed to grey, by the bowed heads of servants utterly loyal and completely unacknowledged, Arawn entered his palace.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rahserat should have fled when he first felt the god. He had no wish to test his masks against the Grey One himself. But Arawn could never be avoided indefinitely. And Arawn was already walking up the gallery.[PARAGRAPH:1]The illicit angel pressed himself into an alcove carved directly from the basalt. Fighting an urge to run Rahserat went to his knees, bowing toward the walkway, and then went still. The footsteps of the Death God and his retinue were the only sounds, and they were coming closer. Then they were before him, and died away. Hearing nothing, knowing Arawn stood before him, Rahserat looked up.[PARAGRAPH:1][ITALICS]"Who are [BOLD]you?[\BOLD]"[\ITALICS][PARAGRAPH:1]Suddenly unable to see, the god's demand hit Rahserat like a hammer blow. Was this how Iaegus fell? The angel felt like he might be crushed, caught between the god's pull and the need to escape. He choked back a damning response and concentrated on his Lord's precept.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Arawn turned his head Rahserat could see again. The god spoke to someone beside him.[PARAGRAPH:1][ITALICS]"It hardly matters. Give him to your brother. Whatever's necessary should be done."[\ITALICS][PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, Arawn. I will see to what's needed."[PARAGRAPH:1]The god walked on, leaving Rahserat with an angel of female aspect. Pale, with long hair utterly black, and wearing pure white. She looked after the god until that one, never glancing back or even to the side, had turned a corner. Then she beckoned Rahserat with a gesture. "Stand."[PARAGRAPH:1]No, she wasn't an angel. She possessed too strong an aura. An archangel.[PARAGRAPH:1]A pair of phantoms waited at her side, one with a spear and one with chains. "You may go. This one is no threat to me. You," she gestured to Rahserat again. "You will come with me."[PARAGRAPH:1]The phantoms followed their god, and Gyra suddenly took Rahserat's face in her hands, seizing him with her eyes. "I will not give you to my brother. I will not even see you driven from this place. For you have work to do."[PARAGRAPH:1]Her eyes blazed, lit by something Rahserat thought he'd seen before, but had long since forgotten. "You see, little angel, [ITALICS]I know who you are, though you do not."[\ITALICS][PARAGRAPH:1]Gyra took him from the Forsaken Palace and to her own places on the edge of the underworld. She showed him many things. Though it was properly in the keeping of her brother, she showed him an unguarded and secret way into Erebus: The Ivory Gate. She showed him better ways to bend others to his will. She could wield compassion like a knife, a knife she gave to him. She took him into her home and introduced him to her daughter, and he though she said nothing he thought he saw a father beyond the daughter: A one-handed man with stars for eyes.[PARAGRAPH:1]And never did she remonstrate with him for his deceptions, for sending more souls on to fallen Spirit master, one who he knew she worked to stop. All of this surprised him. Especially the daughter, Korinna. But nothing shocked him like the false Laroth.[PARAGRAPH:1]They stood on a cliff somehow high above the dreamlands. "Arawn made this place, to more easily survey his domain. My brother cares for other things and never came here, and Arawn comes here seldom now. But still, we shouldn't linger. I have something to show you, then a place for us to go. Come and see."[PARAGRAPH:1]He stepped to the edge and looked where she pointed. "There," she said. "Use your eyes, angel, and look upon the false new kingdom!"[PARAGRAPH:1]It was subtle, but a part of the dreamland, the inhabited underworld, seemed organized. It flowed like the rest, but some dreams stayed apart, mixing only among each other. Reading the flow for pattern, Rahserat looked for that pattern's source. There  a center. A huge hall, like an ivory vault. Mortals of all sorts at its walls and in the center a man with a mirrored crown. The would-be god, Laroth.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gyra touched his shoulder and Rahserat's gaze was torn from the distance. Then the archangel's pointing finger commanded his attention in a new direction. There he spied another seed of order within the dreamland's chaos. Another pattern. This one was smaller, and even more subtle. Furtive might have been a better word. At its center another hall, empty this time. But there was another throne. And on this throne..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"You look upon the new false kingdom, Rahserat. Now: Come and see."[PARAGRAPH:1]Gyra took Rahserat's hand, effortlessly lifting him with her as she rose above the cliff. Then, moving them in her own manner across the dreamland, Rahserat suddenly stood before the second throne. And the second Laroth.[PARAGRAPH:1]The features were the same, and the crown. But rather than empty pits a cloth band of arterial red covered the eyes.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rahserat turned his puzzled face toward the archangel. "Another Laroth?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Gyra nodded. "A false one. Most of the souls you stir come to him. Especially the Patrians. Pelemoc, for example, is already here."[PARAGRAPH:1]"But who is he?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"He is what the mirrors show you. Yourself. Even angels build from dreams here. That's why Arawn has taken them from the angels at the palace. And maybe why..." She shook her head, midnight tresses covering her face for a moment, clearly changing her mind about what she'd been about to say. Continuing, she said "And this is your dream. Or nightmare, I don't know. But this is what you thought you might be. Just like Laroth, but of course you'd rather not just feed his power. Here is your own power base. Souls have been gathering here just as they have around Laroth's throne. But the false Laroth, unlike the other, is [ITALICS]completely[\ITALICS] your creature. He holds the souls here in trust. He will commend them to you, to do with as you will. Let them join Laroth, or swear to your god. Or you may keep them for yourself."[PARAGRAPH:1]"This is an extravagant power you let him... let me possess. Even if it's far less than Laroth's. You oppose him, why do you aid me?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I told you, angel, I know who you are."[PARAGRAPH:1]She refused to explain what she meant, as always, but made Rahserat and herself visible, then introduced him to the false Laroth. The Other Angel. Just as she'd said, the dream-formed Laroth accepted Rahserat as his Lord without the slightest hesitation. He obeyed Rahserat in everything.

Esus might not want the souls to go to the real Laroth if there were other options. And, if nothing else, they could be sold or traded to the hopeful usurper. His Lord knew the price of everything. Rahserat bade the false Laroth to send him a portion of the souls he snared. His Lord might find an immediate use for them, and they'd act as proof.[PARAGRAPH:1]His Lord was not trusting.[PARAGRAPH:1]Furthermore, Gyra offered him a secret way out of the underworld.

		<English>The Centeni is the Scions' Warrior UU. It is one of the very few Scion units who are not undead, and it generally represents a small band of hired mercenaries. Centeni are mostly similar to Warriors, but they have two key differences.
			Firstly, they have the Unreliable promotion. This gives them a 10% strength penalty, and thusly makes them weaker than warriors. However, they also have the Extra Pay ability. This costs 1 gold to use, and grants them a 15% strength bonus for 1 turn. While under the effect of Extra pay, they are ever so slightly stronger than normal warriors. But the fact that they require money to do that, even if only a small amount, makes them generally inferior to warriors.

		<English>"Is she here?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, Gallun, not yet... have you nothing else to say to your wife?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Gallun looked at Caracylna.  She was easily even more beautiful than the day he'd met her, long ago and in another Age.  He had been a solider and she a noble's daughter kidnapped by marauders.  He'd rescued her, and won her hand by... Gallun let the memory slip away.  He wasn't even sure if it was true, or a dream.  It was so long ago and on the other side of death.  The Priests said such things, if not true, were portents of greatness to come.  Perhaps.  Gallun wrenched himself back to the present.[PARAGRAPH:1]"No, Caracylna, I don't.  How's, who is it... Ferrauth?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"He's well.  Caralun never liked him, so he's absented himself.  A race at the river."[PARAGRAPH:1]The conversation petered out, has all had for the last hundred years.  They'd had fun together, Gallun thought, on both sides of the Gift.  Scions didn't say "Nothing lasts forever," anymore, it being blasphemy.  But not everything lasted forever.[PARAGRAPH:1]They waited in companionable silence for their daughter.[PARAGRAPH:1]When Caralun came she was preceded by a sudden wave of silence, then an excited whisper, and then another silence... but not like the one before.  You knew it hid more whispers.[PARAGRAPH:1]Caralun stepped around the corner and the silence entered Caracylna's street as everyone stopped and stared.  It was Lady Korinna!  Thus, the excitement.  Or, wait.  No, it was not Korinna.[PARAGRAPH:1]Caralun was dressed all in black, hair dyed the same shade and a naked blade in her hand.  The Studio had altered the bones of her face and figure to resemble the Protector.  But this was Caralun's neighborhood.  It noticed the eyes, the height.  Not Korinna, but someone devoted to the great Lady's example.  Someone willing to give all she could for the Emperor.  A Martyr.  At first it seemed as if Lady Korinna visited them.  The Lady often walked the streets of the capital now, dispensing her wisdom, gifts, but most of all her presence.  A visit from the Lady presaged luck and success.  Happiness and security.[PARAGRAPH:1]But a Martyr conjured different things.  A Martyr conjured other things entirely.  Death was barred from the city, but the Martyrs of Patria would go seek him out.  Some returned, usually in pieces, and so retired to cask or a Metro Arcanus.  But most did not, and would not be remade till the end of the Age.  By the time they saw their daughter again neither Gallun or Caracylna might remember her.  Caracylna drank Emmerlane, for tears-in-joy, and embraced her daughter.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You look fine!  You look wonderful, the Lady has nothing on you!  I am proud, I tell you, I am so proud!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Gallun did his best to smile.  He embraced his daughter, "Caralun, my Caralun."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Father, say you're proud too."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Of course I am!"[PARAGRAPH:1]"I knew you would be!  Lady Korinna gave me this sword!  The Emperor has blessed it!  Isn't that wonderful!  I knew has soon as I saw Him that this would be the finest thing I could do, the finest thing I could be!"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, daughter..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"But oh, father, I wish I had been born sooner, I wish I had lived with you more first!  We had such good times!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Gallun felt his eyes go moist and hugged her again, pressing her to him.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Oh, father, when he looked at me... Is that how the Lady feels all the time?  Father," she whispered in his ear, "I wish I'd lived longer.  I wish I had more life to give him.  I wish I had more happiness to offer up for him.  Father, I just I wish I could die twice!"</English>
		<French>"Est-elle arrivée ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Non, Gallun, pas encore... N'as-tu rien d'autre à dire à ta femme ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Gallun observa Caracylna. Elle était facilement bien plus belle que le jour de leur rencontre, il y a bien longtemps et dans un autre Âge. Il était alors un soldat et elle la fille d'un noble enlevée par des maraudeurs. Il l'avait délivrée, et gagné sa main en... Gallun laissa le souvenir filer. Il n'était même pas sûr de savoir si c'était un rêve ou la réalité. C'était il y a si longtemps, et de plus de l'autre côté de la mort. Les Prêtres affirmaient que de telles pensées, si elles n'étaient pas réelles, étaient un présage de grandes choses à venir. Peut-être. Gallun s'arracha à ses souvenirs pour revenir au présent.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Non, Caraclyna, rien de plus. Comment va, comment s'appelle-t-il... Ferrauth ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Il va bien. Caralun ne l'a jamais apprécié, odnc il s'est absenté. Un course à la rivière."[PARAGRAPH:1]La conversation s'éteignit là, comme tout ce qu'ils ont fait ces 100 dernières années. Ils s'étaient amusés ensemble, pensait Gallun, des deux côtés du Don. Les Scions ne disent plus "rien ne dure éternellement," car c'est un blasphème. Mais tout n'a pas duré éternellement.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ils attendirent leur fille dans le silence qui les accompagne.[PARAGRAPH:1]Quand Caralun arriva dans la rue, elle fut précédée par un silence soudain, puis un chuchotement excité, puis un autre silence... mais pas de la même nature. Un de ceux qui cachent plus de chochotements.[PARAGRAPH:1]Caralun tourna au coin et le silence s'engouffra dans la rue de Caraclyna à mesure que chacun s'arrêtait pour observer. C'était Dame Korinna ! Puis l'excitation. Ou... attendez. Non, ce n'était pas Korinna.[PARAGRAPH:1]Caralun était habillée tout de noir, les cheveux teints de la même couleur et une lame dégainée à la main. L'Atelier avait modifié son crâne et son visage pour ressembler à la Protectrice. Mais c'était le voisinage de Caralun. Et ils remarquaient les yeux, la taille. Ce n'était pas Korinna, mais quelqu'un dévoué à l'exemple de la grande Dame. Quelqu'un prêt à tout donner pour l'Empereur. Un Martyr. Au début, on aurait dit que Dame korinna leur rendait visite. La DAme marchait maintenant souvent dans les rues de la capitale, transmettant sa sagesse, ses dons, mais plus que tout sa présence. Une visite de la Dame laissait présager chance et succès. Joie et sécurité.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mais un Martyr laissait présager autre chose. Totalement autre chose. La mort était absente de la ville, mais les Martyrs de Patria sortaient la chercher. Certains revenaient, souvent en morceaux, et devenaient des conteneurs arcaniques. Mais pas la plupart, et ils reteront ainsi jusqu'à la fin de l'Âge. La prochaine fois qu'ils reverraient leur fille, ni Gallun ni Caracylna ne pourraient se souvenir d'elle. Caracylna but de l'Emmerlane, afin d'aider ses larmes de joie à venir, et enlaça sa fille.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Tu as l'air d'aller bien ! Tu as l'air radieuse, la Dame n'a rien à t'envier ! Je suis fière, je te le dis, je suis fière !"[PARAGRAPH:1]Gallun fit de son mieux pour sourire. Il enlaça sa fille, "Caralun, ma Caralun."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Père, dis moi aussi que tu es fier."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Bien sûr que je suis fier !"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Je savais que tu le serais ! Dame Korinna m'a donnée cette épée ! L'Empereur l'a bénie ! N'est-ce pas merveilleux ? J'ai su dès que je L'ai vu que ce serait la meilleure chose que je pourrais faire, le mieux que je pourrais être !"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Oui, ma fille..."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Mais, père, oh comme j'aurais aimé naître plus tôt, j'aurais aimé vivre avec vous plus longtemps ! On a passé tellement de bons moments ensemble !"[PARAGRAPH:1]Gallun sentit ses yeux devenir humides et la serra à nouveau, la serrant conter lui.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Oh père, quand Il m'a regardée... est-ce ce que la Dame ressent tout le temps ? Père," elle lui chuchota à l'oreille, "j'aurais aimé vivre plus longtemps. J'aurais aimé pouvoir lui donner plus de vie. J'aurais aimé avoir plus de bonheur à lui offrir. Père, j'aurais juste aimé pouvoir mourir deux fois !"</French>

The Scion army stopped, and so did we - everybody just froze in place.  The Captain was praying, I could hear, but other than that it was silent.  It must have been a trick of the light, or my eyes, but everything seemed to narrow down or funnel around the man on the horse.  The Risen Emperor.  Then his hand rose up, and the Scion army came to ready.  By the time it came down I was already running.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]You wanted my tale, and now you have it.  You'll get no good word from the Hawkwood.  No other word at all.  And that's why I'm here, my friend, and why I'm drinking up the last of your wine before it's too late."</Italian>
		<Spanish>[PARAGRAPH:1]"We made our lines just outside the Hawkwood.  I was on the hill nearest the road. So I had a good view when they appeared.  At first you could just see the sunlight coming off the spearheads and armor.  Shiny bastards.  I saw the Captain grab his horn, waiting for the Prince's.  The plan was to hit them when half of the army was outside the forest.  So the signal didn't come.  More and more came out from the trees.  We'd hoped the Margrave's men would have tied them up, made them leave most their force at the river.  A murmur went down the line and the whole thing shifted back a pace when we saw there were three columns marching from the 'wood.  The Captain said something and held us, I don't remember what.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]Maybe we should have hit them then, but the Prince's horn still didn't blow.  Maybe he'd seen what I'd just noticed... One of the columns was wearing our uniforms.  Some wore tattered, bloody rags.  Some looked like they were on parade.  I saw one that looked practically torn to shreds.  No one spoke, but the line shuddered.  I think it almost broke.  The Captain said something again but I wasn't listening.  It wasn't just metal that gleamed, but bone.  They were dead.  All of them, I think, but some of them were smiling anyway.  The kind of smile we'll all make in our graves, you know what I mean?

"Arrête les, pauvre fou, ou tu les rejoindras."[PARAGRAPH:1]Le mage se recroquevilla loin du fouet et cria, "Mais, mon seigneur, ils ne m'écouteront pas ! Nous..."

		<English>Available to Redactors and, with Necromancy, Ghostwalkers.  The Redactor version has an area of 1.[PARAGRAPH:1]It is the nature of the world that everything is itself.  This may seem a truism, but it does not hold true in the Haunted Lands.  The Haunted Lands join everything together, in the Haunted Lands things *blur*.  Notibly the line between death and life.  There life, of a sort, is found in death and death, of a sort, is found in life.[PARAGRAPH:1]Eating anything grown within the Haunted Lands is very difficult.  The grain may scream when harvested and make bread that crumbles into something like bone meal when baked.  Its beer could taste and smell of nightmares.  Cattle tend to be stillborn, which makes it all the more disturbing as the herds continue to grow.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nevertheless there is much wealth to be found in the Haunted Lands for the brave of heart and strong of stomach.  Examples:  A tree with branches that, when dropped, aged, and dried, taste of nectar and honey after being killed and cooked.  A stream lined with trainable, watchful stones.  A pit full of knowledgeable darkness.</English>
		<French>Disponible pour les [LINK=UNIT_REDACTOR]Scribes[\LINK] et, après avoir découvert la [LINK=TECH_NECROMANCY]Nécromancie[\LINK], pour les [LINK=UNIT_GHOSTWALKER]Marcheurs Fantomatiques[\LINK]. La version des Scribes a une portée de 1.[PARAGRAPH:1]C'est la nature du monde que chaque chose soit elle-même. Ça peut avoir l'air d'un truisme, mais cette vérité est mise en défaut dans les Terres Hantées. Ces dernières rassemblent tout, et les choses s'y 'troublent'. Particulièrement la frontière entre la vie et la mort. Là-bas, la vie est d'une certaine manière trouvée dans la mort, et la mort est d'une certaine manière trouvée dans la vie.[PARAGRAPH:1]Manger quoi que ce soit ayant poussé dans les Terres Hantées est très difficile. Le grain pourrait crier lors de la récolte et faire du pain qui s'effrite en quelque chose à l'air de farine d'os une fois cuit. Sa bière pourrait avoir le goût et l'odeur de cauchemars. Le bétail tend à être mort-né, ce qui est de plus en plus dérangeant à mesure que le troupeau continue de grossir.[PARAGRAPH:1]Néanmoins, de nombreux trésors y attendent le courageux au c&#156;ur et à l'estomac solides. Par exemple, un arbre dont les branches, quand elles sont vieilles et sèches et qu'elles tombent ont le goût de miel et de nectar une fois tuées et cuisinées. Un ruisseau bordé par des pierres vigilantes et entraînables. Une fosse remplie de ténèbres pleines d'enseignements.</French>

		<Spanish>Available to Redactors and, with Necromancy, Ghostwalkers.  The Redactor version has an area of 1.[PARAGRAPH:1]It is the nature of the world that everything is itself.  This may seem a truism, but it does not hold true in the Haunted Lands.  The Haunted Lands join everything together, in the Haunted Lands things *blur*.  Notibly the line between death and life.  There life, of a sort, is found in death and death, of a sort, is found in life.[PARAGRAPH:1]Eating anything grown within the Haunted Lands is very difficult.  The grain may scream when harvested and make bread that crumbles into something like bone meal when baked.  Its beer could taste and smell of nightmares.  Cattle tend to be stillborn, which makes it all the more disturbing as the herds continue to grow.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nevertheless there is much wealth to be found in the Haunted Lands for the brave of heart and strong of stomach.

		<English>"Believed to be a smut - an ailment usually attacking grains - the disease known as "Arawn's Dust" can wipe out not only whole crops of grain, but it also attacks other commercial crops such as dyes or incenses.  Not just some such crops, but *all* of them.  Even more worrying, the disease appears to have spread to cattle as well.  Every herd in the Techel province has been reduced to withered husks covered with white or grey dust.  The devastation is terrible.  Wherever this dust is blown more sickness follows.[PARAGRAPH:1]Arawn's Dust's virulence is too great for any natural disease.
