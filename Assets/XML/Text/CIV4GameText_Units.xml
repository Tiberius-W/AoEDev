		<French>[TAB]Un bateau atelier est un navire conçu pour accomplir des tâches utiles en mer.

		<English>During the Age of Dragons, the gods battled across creation. They fought over land and souls, until Dagda enforced the Compact. The Compact established rules for the relations between the angels, including providence over the souls of the living. When a person dies, regardless of race, his soul is brought to the vault of the deity he served in life, knowingly or not.[PARAGRAPH:1]But some people are bound too closely to their earthly life, and when they die they cannot leave this past life behind, lingering in echoes of memories. The loss of this precious life, the frustration of dreams that will never come to be darkens the heart of the spirit. These desires drag the soul into the Infernal Plains. The soul arrives in Hell, where nightmarish shades whisper to the soul, making him relive his darkest memories over and over. After some time, centuries in some cases, the mind and will of many fallen spirits are broken this way, some of these spirits vanish, while others are devoured by the whispering fiends and other animal-shaped Hungry Ghosts, spirits whose reason vanished and who exist only to satisfy their most primal desires. Some spirits survive the mind-shattering whispers and change: they become Spectres.[PARAGRAPH:1]Spectres are fallen spirits who recovered clear reason. Their appearance and personality are similar to what they had in life, and these will never change; the falling process galvanizes their soul to this shape. These spectres group themselves in hopeless communities to defend themselves from a highly hostile environment, but they keep the dreams and wishes they had in life, dreams and wishes whose realization is almost impossible in that hellish place. Dreams and wishes that don't go away, memories of the lost ones, that will to not disappear, nothing fades from the unchanging soul of the Spectre.[PARAGRAPH:1]During the Age of Magic, a Black Sea appeared by the shores of the razor-glass plain of Naraka. The sky in Hell is starless, but the waveless surface of the Black Sea reflected stars, stars that are not from Creation. Rumor spread that its waters were capable of making specters lose their memories, dreams and wishes, of making one's self disappear. Many specters, bored with their grey afterlife, pilgrimaged to the Black Sea, washing away their heart. But the dark waters don't wash away everything; a husk stays behind, a husk that is animated by ominous will. These beings are called Wraiths, a creature so unnatural that they are hated even by the fiends. After they are born on the shores of the Black Sea they float to a sinister tower in the middle of that sea, a windowless tower of infinite height, and no man knows what exists inside.</English>

		<German>Während des Zeitalters der Drachen führten die Götter den Krieg überall in der Schöpfung. Sie kämpften um Land und Seelen, bis Dagda den Vertrag erzwang. Der Vertrag regelte die Verhältnisse zwischen den Engeln, einschließlich der Bestimmung über die Seelen der Lebenden. Wenn eine Person stirbt, ganz gleich von welcher Rasse, wird seine Seele in die Gruft der Gottheit gebracht, der er zu Lebzeiten gedient hat, wissentlich oder nicht.[PARAGRAPH:1]Doch manche Leute sind zu sehr an ihr Leben auf Erden gebunden, und wenn sie sterben können sie ihr vergangenes Leben nicht hinter sich lassen, gefangen in den Echos der Erinnerungen. Der Verlust dieses vorherigen Lebens und die Frustration über unverwirklichte Träume verdunkeln das Herz ihrer Seele. Diese Sehnsüchte zerren sie in die Infernalen Länder. Schließlich erreicht die Seele die Hölle, wo alptraumhafte Schatten zu ihr flüstern und sie dazu zwingen, ihre dunkelsten Erinnerungen wieder und wieder zu erleben. Nach einer langen Zeit, in manchen Fällen Jahrhunderte, ist der Verstand und der Wille der meisten gefallenen Seelen gebrochen, einige von ihnen verschwinden, während andere von den flüsternden Teufeln und anderen, tierartigen hungrigen Geistern verschlungen werden, Seelen ohne Verstand die nur existieren um ihre niedrigsten Bedürfnisse zu befriedigen. Doch einige Seelen überleben das verstand zermürbende Geflüster und verwandeln sich: sie werden zu Phantomen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Phantome sind gefallene Seelen die ihren klaren Verstand bewahrten. Ihre Erscheinung und ihre Persönlichkeit sind deren aus ihrem Leben sehr ähnlich und das wird sich niemals ändern; der Prozess des Dahinscheidens verschmalz ihre Seele mit dieser Gestalt. Die Phantome gruppieren sich zu hoffnungslosen Gemeinschaften, um sich vor der extrem lebensfeindlichen Umgebung zu schützen, doch sie behalten die Träume und Wünsche aus ihrem Leben, Träume und Wünsche deren Verwirklichung an diesem teuflischen Ort geradezu unmöglich ist. Träume und Wünsche die nicht verschwinden, Erinnerungen an die Verlorenen, die nicht nachlassen, nichts weicht von der unveränderlichen Seele eines Phantoms.[PARAGRAPH:1]Während des Zeitalters der Magie erschien der Schwarze See an den an den messerscharfen Küsten der gläsernen Ebenen von Naraka. Der Himmel in der Hölle hat keine Sterne, doch die wellenlose Oberfläche des Schwarzen Sees zeigt Sterne, Sterne die nicht aus der Schöpfung stammen. Gerüchte wurden laut sein Wasser sei dazu in der Lage, die Erinnerungen der Phantome auszulöschen, Träume und Wünsche, sich selbst verschwinden zu lassen. Viele Phantome, zu Tode gelangweilt von ihrem grauen Leben nach dem Tod, pilgerten zum Schwarzen See und spülten ihre Herzen hinfort. Aber das schwarze Wasser spült nicht alles weg; die Hülle bleibt zurück, eine Hülle die von einem unheilvollen Willen getrieben wird. Diese Wesen nennt man Gespenster, Kreaturen so unnatürlich, dass sie sogar von den Teufeln gehasst werden. Nachdem sie an den Küsten des Schwarzen Sees geboren wurden, treiben sie zu einem unheimlichen Turm in der Mitte des Sees, ein Turm ohne Fenster und von unendlicher Höhe, und niemand kann erahnen was in ihm ist.</German>

		<English>Infused with the magic of Sucellus, the Reborn, the Druids are the mages of nature and bringers of life. Because the only way to gain true and lasting knowledge of how to manipulate the very fabric of life itself is to devote one's whole existence to intimate contact with nature, Druids are a reclusive and not terribly social folk. The Druids form a loose brotherhood of near-hermits who meet once a year to compete, share knowledge, and bond, before they once again disperse to their various fields and forests. Their powerful organic magic means that many empires employ them not so much for their use in war, but for their use in peace, perfecting the land and making it more fertile. Few established empires are incapable of contacting a few Druids to help them repair the scars of war and industry or bring life and lushness to previously infertile regions.[PARAGRAPH:1]Only neutral players can build Druids.</English>

		<German>Erfüllt von der Magie des Sucellus, sind die Wiedergeborenen, die Druiden, die Magier der Natur und Überbringer des Lebens. Da der einzige Weg, wahres und beständiges Wissen über die Manipulation der tatsächlichen Fasern des Lebens selbst zu erlangen, die ganze Hingabe der eigenen Existenz an einen intimen Kontakt mit der Natur ist, sind Druiden von einem zurückgezogenen und nicht besonders sozialen Schlag. Die Druiden bilden eine lose Bruderschaft von Einsiedlern, die einander einmal im Jahr treffen, um sich aneinander zu messen, ihr Wissen auszutauschen, und einander näher zu kommen, bevor sie sich wieder auf ihre zahlreichen Felder und Wälder aufteilen. Ihre machtvolle organische Magie bewirkt, dass viele Reiche sie nicht für ihren Gebrauch im Krieg einstellen, sondern für ihren Nutzen im Frieden, dass Land zu perfektionieren und fruchtbarer zu machen. Wenige namhafte Reiche sind unfähig, auch nur ein paar Druiden zu erreichen, die ihnen helfen, die Wunden des Krieges und der Industrie zu heilen, oder Leben und Wachstum in ehemals unfruchtbare Gebiete zu bringen.</German>

After a brief resurgance during the Age of Ice they are now scattered and infrequent outside of Mulcarn's hell.[PARAGRAPH:2]From the Bestiary of Erebus, by Kael[PARAGRAPH:2]Dagda reprimanded the other gods. "Why do you pursue these selfish projects? There is no order in what you do." It was the time before Man and his kin. The twenty-one servants were new in their powers, and exulted in the heady joy of unbridled creation. Little thought was given to the consequences of many of their endeavors, and entire worlds were often shaped by one god alone. Dagda alone forbore utilizing his power, observing the others. At the grey lord's words, the others turned, from the corners of temperance, to listen to his plan. Worlds should be made in which no aspect was expressed over any other so that in harmony something unique could be formed. Creatures in balance might express the supreme gift that they themselves had been given - free will. The wisdom of his words was clear, and a multitude of such worlds were made, where neither ice nor fire was ascendant, where light and darkness took their turns, and where faith and foresight together illuminated the minds of the mortals. Thus were worlds pleasing to the One formed. [PARAGRAPH:1]Many gods, in their deepest souls, resented their reprimand from Dagda, despite its wisdom. Mulcarn was one such. Frost Giants had been created by his hand alone. They did not obey the laws of Cernunnos or of Bhall. They had no need of mind nor spirit, and they bowed to him alone. But no place was found for these glaciers on legs in the orderly creation. They languished on worlds of ice in the dimensions of folly, which saw little of the gods after the mortal races came to prominence. [PARAGRAPH:1]So one of Mulcarn's joys upon enthroning himself on Erebus was bringing his ancient Frost Giants to his side. They need not eat, and they cannot reproduce. The barest glint of sentience has awakened in them now that they are again in their Father's presence. His thoughts are their thoughts, and their glassy eyes are his eyes as well. They wander the endless tundra, proof that since Mulcarn needed no help in creation, he needs none in sovereignty either.</English>

		<English>The Frost Speakers, disciples of Mulcarn, were tolerated by most nations in the Age of Magic. They would pledge allegiance to no sovereign, but they did not speak sedition, either. Well beyond stoic in their demeanor, followers of Winter lost passion of all sorts. Initiation to this order involved bathing in icy waters overnight. Those who survived the 'baptism' usually had their outlook changed dramatically by it, without need of theological debate.[PARAGRAPH:1]These cold men now lead the armies of their god. Slow to adapt to their enemies' tactics, their strength lies in unflinching rationality, carrying out their plans unhindered by fear, ambition, or personal attachment. They will patch up wounded soldiers with divine aid of their god-king, but evidence suggests their compassion is something to be desired. More than once Amurite recon patrols have found badly wounded Illian warriors buried in the snow-occasionally still breathing.</English>
		<French>[TAB]Les Pr&#234;cheurs du froid, disciples de Mulcarn, était tolérés par la plupart des nations pendant l'Age de magie. Ils ne juraient allégeance à aucun souverain, sans pour autant devenir des insurgés. Au-delà du sto&#239;cisme, les adeptes de l'hiver avaient perdu toute passion. L'initiation dans cet ordre consistait à se baigner dans de l'eau glacée pendant toute une nuit. Ceux qui survivaient à ce bapt&#234;me changeaient radicalement de perspective, sans passer par un débat théologique.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ces hommes de glace étaient à présent à la t&#234;te des armées de leur dieu. Lents à s'adapter aux tactiques de leurs ennemis, leur force résidait dans leur rationalité imperturbable. Ils mettaient leurs plans à exécution sans aucune peur, ambition ou affection. Ils soignaient les blessures des soldats avec l'aide de leur roi-dieu, mais sans aucune compassion. Plus d'une fois, les patrouilles de reconnaissance amurites découvraient des soldats illians blessés, enterrés dans la neige, parfois encore vivants.</French>
		<German>[TAB]Die Frostredner, Jünger Mulcarns, wurden von den meisten Nationen im Zeitalter der Magie geduldet. Sie schworen keinem Oberhaupt die Treue, doch sie predigten auch nicht den Aufstand. Die Anhänger des Winters waren weit mehr als stoisch im Benehmen, sie hatten jegliche Leidenschaft verloren.  Zum Initiationsritus dieses Ordens gehörte ein Bad in Eiswasser über Nacht. Diejenigen, die diese 'Taufe' überlebten, hatten auch ohne theologische Debatte drastisch veränderte Ansichten.[PARAGRAPH:1]Diese kühlen Männer führen jetzt die Armeen ihres Gottes an. Sie können sich nur langsam an die Taktiken des Feindes anpassen, ihre Stärke liegt in unerschütterlicher Rationalität, sie verfolgen ihre Ziele, ohne durch Furcht, Ehrgeiz oder persönliche Neigung abgelenkt zu sein. Sie werden verwundete Soldaten mit der göttlichen Hilfe ihres Gottkönigs heilen, auch wenn ihr Mitgefühl offenkundig zu wünschen übrig lässt. Mehr als einmal haben Kundschafterpatrouillen der Amuriten schwer verwundete Illian-Krieger im Schnee begraben gefunden - von denen manche noch geatmet hatten.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]Gli Oratori di ghiaccio, discepoli di Mulcarn, erano tollerati dalla maggior parte delle nazioni nell'Era della Magia. Non giuravano fedeltà ad alcun signore, ma nemmeno predicavano rivolta. Ben pi&#249; di stoici, nel loro comportamento, i seguaci dell'Inverno perdevano qualsiasi passione. L'iniziazione per quest'ordine prevedeva un bagno di una notte in acque ghiacciate. Coloro che sopravvivevano al "batttesimo" di solito cambiavano radicalmente punto di vista, senza bisogno di dibattiti teologici.[PARAGRAPH:1]Questi freddi uomini ora guidano le armate del loro dio. Lenti ad adattarsi alle tattiche del nemico, la loro forza giace nella risoluta razionalità, che li porta a eseguire i piani senza farsi intralciare da paura, ambizione o motivi personali. Guariscono i soldati feriti con l'aiuto del loro dio-re, ma i fatti suggeriscono che la loro compassione lasci a desiderare. Pi&#249; di una volta le pattuglie di Amuriti hanno trovato soldati illiani gravemente feriti sepolti nella neve, alle volte ancora vivi.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[TAB]Las Voces de la Escarcha, como se conoc&#237;a a los disc&#237;pulos de Mulcarn, eran tolerados en casi todas partes durante la Edad de la Magia. No obedec&#237;an a soberano alguno, pero tampoco fomentaban la sedici&#243;n. De comportamiento m&#225;s que estoico, los seguidores del invierno abandonaban todas las pasiones. De hecho, el ritual de iniciaci&#243;n en la orden requer&#237;a que el candidato pasara una noche entera sumergido en agua helada. Normalmente, aquellos que sobreviv&#237;an al "bautismo" lo hac&#237;an con dram&#225;ticos cambios de personalidad, sin necesidad de mediar un debate ideol&#243;gico.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ahora, estos hombres de hielo dirigen los ejércitos de su dios. Lentos a la hora de adoptar las t&#225;cticas de sus enemigos, su fuerza reside en su implacable racionalidad y su capacidad para llevar sus planes a la pr&#225;ctica sin dejarse influir por el miedo, la ambici&#243;n o los intereses personales. Pueden curar a sus soldados heridos con la ayuda de su dios, pero todo indica que en su interior la compasi&#243;n brilla por su ausencia. M&#225;s de una patrulla de reconocimiento amurita ha encontrado guerreros ilios malheridos enterrados en la nieve... a&#250;n con vida, en algunos casos.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]The dominant animal in the Ice Age, these colossal creatures have little to fear from anyone but large packs of wolves or bands of well-armed human hunters (in the case of the Doviello, the distinction between the two is somewhat blurry). Other creatures have little to fear from them, as they are quite peaceful when not threatened, and live off the few plants that still grow in the more hospitable areas of the tundra.[PARAGRAPH:1]Rumor has it that certain human cultures have managed to tame these creatures, and kindle their dormant instinct for destruction to turn them into mighty and terrible war animals.</English>
		<French>[TAB]Ces énormes créatures, animaux dominants de l'Âge de Glace, ne craignaient que les grandes meutes de loups et les groupes de chasseurs humains bien armés (pour ce qui est des Doviellons, la distinction entre les deux est un peu floue). Les autres créatures n'avaient pas peur des mammouths, car ils étaient plut&#244;t paisibles lorsqu'ils n'étaient pas menacés, et se nourrissaient des rares plantes des endroits les plus hospitaliers de la toundra.[PARAGRAPH:1]On raconte que certaines cultures humaines avaient réussi à dompter ces créatures, et à éveiller en elles leur instinct de destruction, en les transformant en machines de guerre toutes-puissantes. </French>
		<German>[TAB]Das dominante Tier der Eiszeit, diese kolossale Kreatur, musste kaum etwas fürchten, abgesehen von großen Wolfsrudeln oder gut ausgerüsteten menschlichen Jägern (in dem Fall die Doviello, die Unterschiede verwischen sich hier). Andere Kreaturen haben von ihm nichts zu befürchten, denn es ist friedfertig, wenn es nicht bedroht wird, es ernährt sich von den wenigen Pflanzen, die in den etwas fruchtbareren Gegenden der Tundra immer noch wachsen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gerüchten zufolge haben bestimmte menschliche Kulturen es geschafft, diese Kreaturen zu zähmen und ihre schlafenden zerstörerischen Instinkte zu wecken, um sie in mächtige und Schrecken erregende Kriegstiere zu verwandeln.</German>

Le altre creature avevano poco da temere, perché si trattava di animali pacifici, quando non erano minacciati, che vivevano delle poche piante che ancora crescono nelle zone pi&#249; accoglienti della tundra.[PARAGRAPH:1]Si dice che certe culture siano riuscite ad addomesticare queste creature e a stimolare il loro istinto assopito come distruttori, trasformandole in potenti e terribili animali da guerra.</Italian>

		<English>[TAB]The armies of men and other intelligent races have long recognized a basic principle in warfare: bigger is better. Catapults wreak havoc upon cities while slingers merely pester with their smaller stones, and armor that covers one's entire body rather than an arm here and a leg there is highly sought after. Upon the withdrawal of the Dragons upon the signing of the Compact, the enormous elephants were quickly seized upon as the most powerful vehicles of war. Able to carry a small squad, and not altogether put out by palisade walls, a few of these beasts could transform a small army into a demoralizing threat. [PARAGRAPH:1]Their cousins, the mammoths, were not new to the Age of Ice. The new climate allowed these beasts to thrive across a wider swath of the world, however, and the armies that assembled were eager to take advantage of this. Mulcarn's armies no less. The Illian Mammoth Riders cast an intimidating shadow across the battlefield, one comparable to even the mighty Frost Giant.</English>
		<French>[TAB]En matière de guerre, les races douées d'intelligence ont depuis longtemps compris le principe suivant : plus c'est gros, mieux c'est. Les catapultes dévastent les cités, alors que les frondes sont presque inutiles ; l'armure qui recouvre entièrement le corps est bien plus recherchée que celle qui couvre un bras par ici et une jambe par là. Au moment du retrait des Dragons après la signature du pacte, les éléphants ont rapidement été capturés pour &#234;tre transformés en véhicules de guerre. Ces animaux sont capables de porter une petite escouade sur le dos, ils se moquent des palissades et peuvent transformer une toute petite armée en redoutable menace.[PARAGRAPH:1]Leurs cousins, les mammouths, connaissaient bien l'Âge de Glace. Grâce au changement de climat, ils ont accès à une plus grande partie de ce monde et les armées assemblées ont hâte d'en profiter, y compris celle de Mulcarn. Les Chevaucheurs de Mammouths illians sont très impressionnants sur le champ de bataille, presque autant que les Géants de glace.</French>
		<German>[TAB]Die Armeen der Menschheit und anderer intelligenter Völker haben dieses einfache Prinzip der Kriegsführung schon lange erkannt: je größer, desto besser. Katapulte legen Städte in Schutt und Asche, während normale Steinschleudern mit kleinen Steinen eher nur lästig sind, Rüstungen, die den ganzen Körper abdecken, anstatt nur hier ein Stück Arm und dort ein Stück Bein, sind heiß begehrt. Nach dem Abzug der Drachen nach der Unterzeichnung des Pakts, waren die enormen Elefanten schnell als mächtigstes Kriegsvehikel in Beschlag genommen worden. Sie konnten einen kleinen Trupp befördern, und wenn sie nicht durch Palisadenwälle abgehalten wurden, konnten wenige dieser Tiere eine kleine Armee in eine demoralisierende Bedrohung verwandeln.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ihre Verwandten, die Mammuts, waren in der Eiszeit nicht neu. Die Klimaveränderung erlaubte es diesen Tieren jedoch, einen größeren Bereich der Welt zu durchstreifen, und die Armeen, die sich rüsteten, brannten darauf, dies auszunutzen, Mulcarns Armeen ebenso. Die illianischen Mammutreiter warfen einen beängstigenden Schatten auf das Schlachtfeld, vergleichbar selbst mit dem der mächtigen Frostriesen.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]Gli eserciti umani e di altre specie intelligenti hanno da molto accettato un principio base, nell'arte della guerra: pi&#249; è grosso meglio è. Le catapulte seminano distruzione sulle città mentre le fionde danno solo fastidio, e sono molto ricercate le armature che coprono il corpo intero, invece che un braccio qui e una gamba l&#236;. Con il ritiro dei draghi, alla firma del patto, gli enormi elefanti furono presto riconosciuti come i pi&#249; potenti veicoli da guerra. Capaci di trasportare una piccola squadra, e non esattamente scoraggiati dalle palizzate, poche bestie di queste potevano trasformare un piccolo esercito in una minaccia disarmante. [PARAGRAPH:1]I loro cugini, i mammut, non erano nati assieme all'Era Glaciale. Il nuovo clima semplicemente permetteva loro di spostarsi su un territorio pi&#249; vasto, e gli eserciti che si formarono erano ansiosi di approfittarne. Cos&#236; anche l'esercito di Mulcarn. I Cavalieri di mammut illiani proiettavano ombre inquietanti sui campi di battaglia, comparabili addirittura a quelle dei potenti Giganti di ghiaccio.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[TAB]Los ejércitos de hombres y otras razas inteligentes han aprendido hace mucho un principio b&#225;sico de la guerra: cuanto m&#225;s grande mejor. Las catapultas siembran el caos en las ciudades enemigas, mientras que los honderos, con sus peque&#241;as piedras, son una mera molestia, y las armaduras capaces de cubrir el cuerpo entero en lugar de un brazo o una pierna son muy codiciadas. Tras la retirada de los dragones, a la firma del pacto, estos enormes elefantes pasaron a ser las herramientas de guerra m&#225;s poderosas. Capaces de llevar un peque&#241;o n&#250;mero de soldados en su lomo y de derribar empalizadas, unas pocas de estas bestias pueden transformar un peque&#241;o ejército en una fuerza desmoralizante. [PARAGRAPH:1]Sus primos, los mamuts, no hab&#237;an aparecido en la Edad de Hielo. Sin embargo, el nuevo clima les permit&#237;a llegar m&#225;s lejos, y los ejércitos de la época no dudaron en aprovechar esta ventaja. Entre ellos, los de Mulcarn. Los jinetes de mamuts ilios proyectan una sombra amenazante sobre el campo de batalla, comparable incluso a la del poderoso gigante de la escarcha.</Spanish>

		<German>Der Feuerball ist zwar in der Regel nicht so mächtig wie andere beschworene Einheiten, wird aber auf Grund seines hohen Nutzens von vielen Magiern bevorzugt. Er verursacht Kollateralschäden und kann Stadtverteidigungen bombardieren. Da ein Feuerball fliegt, kann er auch entfernte Ziele und sogar Ziele auf dem Wasser, wie feindliche Schiffe in der Nähe, treffen. Außerdem erhalten feindliche Einheiten, die einen Feuerball im Kampf besiegen, anders als bei anderen beschworenen Einheiten, keine Erfahrungspunkte, so dass sie perfekt geeignet sind, um deren Verteidigung zu schwächen.</German>

		<English>Anton Konal had been burning for nearly twenty hours.[PARAGRAPH:1]It hadn't been hard to lure him to the empty silo, he followed Gosea without complaint.  Even though he towered over Gosea, he hadn't tried to force himself on her.  Instead he begged and issued clumsy compliments in an attempt to seduce her.  Gosea was disgusted by him.[PARAGRAPH:1]The hard part was finding a place for the sacrifice.  Since it was spring many of the silos along the docks were empty, and Mahon found one large enough to construct what they needed inside without anyone seeing the fire.  Gosea's magic would take care of the screams.[PARAGRAPH:1]Once Anton arrived Mahon tied him to the large post in the center of the empty silo.  Anton was forced atop a pile of refuse from the docks, splintered crates and barrels, planks and rope.  All were coated with lamp oil.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gosea lit the flames and they stood in perfect silence as Anton writhed in pain.  The fire consumed his feet then up along his legs.  His skin peeled and blackened, revealing thick layers of fat beneath that burned and melted like candle wax.  There was so much fat on him that hot, liquid streams of it crawled down his legs and dripped hissing into the flames.[PARAGRAPH:1]In time he stopped screaming, but Gosea's magic wouldn't let him die.  His voice was gone and the flames had eaten away all the unnecessary parts of him.  Anton's massive frame, blackened and burnt, was little more than bones covered with thick muscle.[PARAGRAPH:1]That was when the ritual changed.  Instead of being consumed by the fire Anton's body began consuming it.  Mahon poured more lamp oil on the fire until the flames were as high as Anton's waist but Anton seemed empowered it.  The fire greedily licked at Anton's chest, arms and shoulders.  It was absorbed and drawn into him.  And over time a hot orange glow came from within his chest, and behind his eyes.[PARAGRAPH:1]There he stood, eyes fixed on Gosea in passive supplication.  He was no longer alive, but unable to die.  His most basic animalistic desires were tethered to his body by Gosea's spell.  When the ritual was done Mahon cut him free and what had been Anton lumbered off the pyre, ready to receive Gosea's commands.[PARAGRAPH:2]Fideism - Chapter 6</English>

		<English>The frigate was a fast and powerful warship that evolved to fill several important roles, but one of its primary roles was to raid enemy shipping. These three masted ships were lighter and faster than the great ship or man-of-war, and usually carried 36 or fewer soldiers. The frigate was powerful enough to overcome most of its prospective opponents and fast enough to escape those it could not outgun. Because of their speed and strength, frigates were often employed as escorts for merchant vessels during times of war. The frigate remained the most useful and dominant naval vessel until the development of the Queen of the Sea.</English>

		<German>[TAB]Während dem Zeitalter der Magie, haben Gelehrte die Theorie aufgestellt, dass der Mensch und seine verwandten Rassen, aus jeder der 21 Bereichen der Schöpfung zusammengesetzt wurden. Das Zusammenspiel zwischen Feuer und Eis, Hoffnung und Weisheit, Geist und Körper und sonstige, sich widerstreitende Kräfte, gab ihnen einen internen Konflikt, jedoch auch unbegrenzte Möglichkeiten. Wenn ein Mensch einen Gott wählte, um ihm zu dienen, so wurde ein Element seiner Person durch seine gottgeweihte Verbindung dadurch gestärkt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mit Mulcarn´s Präsenz in Erebus, wurde der Bezug zum Eise durchwegs in allem ermächtigt, in dieser einst ausgewogenen Dimension. Das Wetter ist ein Grossteil der unumstößlichen Zeugnisse jener, obwohl vielleicht die Trostlosigkeit vieler Völker nicht aus ihrer Unterjochung stammte, sondern von der stummen, kühlenden Kraft, welche inmitten ihnen aufquillt. Der womöglich düsterste und bedrohlichste Ausdruck der Überlegenheit des Eises ist die Erschaffung des Frostlings. Wenn ein Mensch, Zwerg, Elf oder Ork in diesem Zeitalter stirbt, gibt es immer eine Chance, dass das Eis in ihm, an sich selbst ausüben wird, stehlend einen Teil seines Willens, und sodann als Frostling aufersteht. Urtümliche, blindwütige Kreaturen, die in Schneestürme lauern und dann auf menschliche Siedlungen ausschwärmen, wenn ihre Anzahl hoch genug erscheint. Frostlinge sind bewaffnet mit Keulen aus Eiszäpfen, oder schlicht nur gefährlich durch ihre klirrenden, Kälte verbreitenden Berührungen und hinterlassen eine marodierte Siedlung zurück, als ob sie von einer Lawine erschlagen wurde.</German>

		<English>I was invited to attend the initiation rites of the Ecclesiastics in Balderham. Ordinarily I would have feared some attempt at propaganda or persuasion, but in all things the Empyrean is open. The Vicar and one Ecclesiastic walked from the temple, at the heart of the city, while I followed behind a respectful distance, a welcome observer but not participant. We went not to the manor house of the local lord, nor the poor beggars in their slums, nor to some sacred altar from which to pray. The Vicar led us to the dungeon, and the Ecclesiastic aspirant showed the same surprised a felt.[PARAGRAPH:1]The guards let us pass, and downwards we walked, through the squalor that inevitably collected in such a place, even a relatively enlightened realm such as this. Men moved forward to watch us as we passed. Some hurled taunts or mockery, while some hurled more vile substances, the excrement occasionally landing on the vicars robes. [PARAGRAPH:1]The young man flinched, though his mentor did not. "Why have we come to such a dark place, Father?" asked the Ecclesiastic. "Why do we go anywhere?" was the reply. "To bring light into the darkness." This was some sort of code or mantra, for they both spoke it together. They stopped at one cell, a ragged man shuffled up to the bars, blinking in the light of our torch. "This is the darkest corner of our realm, dear child, not for the fact that we descend deep into this hole, but for the depravity of those who were brought here. This man has... his hands are stained with the blood of man. But he has requested to hear of the light. If you can bring him from the darkness, you will be ready for your vows. Lugus will show you the way." The Vicar passed the torch to his charge, and turned to leave. The man behind the bars sank to his knees and cried, "Teach me, lord, please!"[PARAGRAPH:1]The boy knelt to pray for wisdom, and I turned to leave as well, though I caught the eye to the imprisoned man and grew to doubt success of the young man's mission in this place.[PARAGRAPH:2]From chapter 3 of Reflections on the State Cults, by Elder Methyl of the Luonnotar.</English>

		<German>Ich wurde eingeladen, dem Aufnahmeritus der Geistlichen beizuwohnen. Normalerweise hätte ich Propaganda oder Bekehrungsversuche erwartet, aber alles in allem missioniert das Empyrion nicht aktiv. Der Vikar und ein junger Anwärter auf das Amt des Geistlichen verließen den Tempel im Herzen der Stadt, und ich folgte ihnen mit angemessenem Abstand  ein willkommener Beobachter, aber unbeteiligt. Unser Ziel war weder das Herrenhaus des Fürsten der Stadt, noch das Armenviertel, noch ein geweihter Altar, an dem Gebete gesprochen wurden. Der Vikar führte uns zu einem Verließ, und der Anwärter wirkte genau so überrascht wie ich.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Wachen ließen uns passieren, und so schritten wir durch den Schmutz, der sich sogar in einem recht hellen Reich wie diesem sammelte. Männer beobachteten uns, als wir an ihnen vorbeigingen. Einige spotteten und höhnten, andere spuckten auf und trafen die Robe des Vikars. [PARAGRAPH:1]Der junge Mann zuckte zusammen, doch seinen Mentor kümmerte es nicht. "Warum gehen wir an einen so finsteren Ort, Pater? " fragte der Anwärter. "Warum gehen wir überhaupt an einen Ort?" lautete die Antwort. "Um Licht in die Dunkelheit zu bringen." sagten beide gleichzeitig, als wäre es eine Art Schwur. Sie hielten vor einer Zelle an, ein heruntergekommener Mann zog sich an den Gittern hoch und blinzelte in die Flamme unserer Fackel. "Das ist die dunkelste Ecke unseres Reiches, mein Sohn, nicht nur weil er so tief unter der Erde liegt, sondern weil hier Verdorbenen hierher gebracht werden. Dieser Mann hat... seine Hände sind mit Menschenblut befleckt. Aber er hat gebeten, über das Licht unterrichtet zu werden. Wenn du ihn aus der Dunkelheit führen kannst, bis du bereit für deine Weihe. Lugus wird dir den Weg weisen." Der Vikar gab dem Anwärter die Fackel, und machte anstalten, zu gehen. Der Gefangene sank hinter den Gittern auf seine Knie und rief, "Helft mir, Herr, bitte!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Der junge Mann kniete ebenfalls nieder und bat um Weisheit, und ich machte mich auch auf, zu gehen. Dabei warf ich noch einen Blick auf den gefangenen und in mir wuchsen die Zweifel am Erfolg des jungen Mannes.[PARAGRAPH:2] - Auszug aus Kapitel 3 der "Reflektionen über Staatsreligionen", verfasst von Ältester Methyl der Luonnatar.</German>

		<German>Ein Druide stand umgeben von seinen Schülern - gleich einer von Setzlingen umringten Eiche. Sie befanden sich inmitten eines Kreises aus Rosenblütenblättern, welche in von Priestern des Laubes gesegnetem Quellwasser getaucht wurden. Auf diese Weise geschützt konnten Sie den Wald ungestört beobachten. In diesem Fall wurde ihre Aufmerksamkeit auf einen alten, verletzten Wolf gelenkt, der scheinbar von seinem Rudel ausgestoßen wurde. Nachdem die Schüler einige Monate mit den Feinheiten der Natur verwoben waren, weckte der Wolf ihr Mitleid. Kurz darauf tappte der Wolf in die Falle einer Pumamutter, die ihre Jungen trainierte. Als der Wolf fiel, zuckten einige der Anwärter zusammen.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Versteht ihr es immer noch nicht?", tadelte der Druide, "Warum haltet ihr zu dem Wolf und nicht zu den Pumas?" Jeder gab bei dem Versuch ihren Instinkt zu rechtfertigen eine andere Antwort. "Der Wolf war geschwächt - das war unfair." "Der Wolf ist ein erhabeneres Tier." "Da wo vorher zwei am Leben waren ist es nun nur noch einer." [PARAGRAPH:1] "Vertraut der Weisheit mit der die Welt geschaffen wurde", erklärte der Druide, "Wir sind nicht dazu da, über die Natur zu richten, sondern zu lernen sie zu verstehen, aus ihrer Mitte heraus. Die Natur bevorzugt nicht die Schwachen, daher ist es auch nicht unsere Aufgabe, die Hilflosen zu beschützen. Sie hält nicht ein Leben für wertvoller als ein Anderes - sie lässt alle wetteifern. Und wenn am Ende eine Pflanze, ein Wolf, ein Elf oder ein Mensch obsiegt - dann soll es so sein. Außerdem bevorzugt die Natur keineswegs das Leben vor dem Tode. Jedes Lebewesen erhält beides genau einmal und wird jedes im Rahmen seiner Fähigkeiten ausführen. Eure Pflicht ist nicht das Leben um jeden Preis zu erhalten, meine Schösslinge, sondern die Entfaltungsmöglichkeit des Wettstreites zu erweitern. Verbreitet die Samen grüner Pflanzen, so dass sie wachsen und auch eingehen können und gebt ihnen die Essenz des gesamten Lebensgespinstes." [PARAGRAPH:1]Ihren Unterricht vollendet folgten die Schüler dem Druiden zurück durch den Wald. Uralte Bäume öffneten ihm den Weg wie Vorhänge im Winde.

He is abducted and taken to temple, usually on the night of the full moon. The hands and feet are bound. Sleep is induced. Some sects use various herbal concoctions; this one simply strangled the man until he passed out. He is laid in a shallow pool, submerged partially in sea water.[PARAGRAPH:1]All night the Cultists gather around, listening for anything he might say in this sleep. This becomes the zealots new name. It is etched onto a clay jar, which is filled with sea water. I observed the names on some of these. "The Leviathan Trembles But Does Not Awaken," read one. "Pour the Blood of the Slaves Into the Styx," another. The victim tonight seemed to hear nothing, for he was silent as he slept, nearly until dawn. Should this be the case, the victim is drowned and serves in the undead army of the Overlords. Fortunately for this man, or perhaps not, he at last called out screaming, "The distant one has watching eyes!"[PARAGRAPH:1]The Cultists nodded to each other and pulled the man from the water. When he saw them holding him, he cringed. They spoke not to him, but dragged him to the back of the temple. I was unable to follow, but observed the Zealot days later in sea colored robes. He had bloodshot eyes, and moved through the crowd in the town marketplace engaged in a constant dialogue with himself.[PARAGRAPH:2]From chapter 7 of Reflections on the State Cults, by Elder Methyl of the Luonnotar.</English>

		<German>Bisher konnte ich noch nicht feststellen, nach welchen Kriterien die Okkultisten ihre Fanatiker auswählen. Manchmal ist es ein Landstreicher, manchmal aber auch der Sohn oder die Tochter eines Adligen, und jeder dazwischen kann es genauso gut sein. Er wird entführt und zum Tempel gebracht, normalerweise in einer Vollmondnacht. Hände und Füße werden gefesselt, Schlaf wird herbeigeführt. Einige Sekten nutzen diverse Kräutertränke, in diesem Fall wurde der Mann einfach bis zur Bewusstlosigkeit gewürgt. Danach hat man ihn in ein flaches Becken gelegt und teilweise in Meerwasser eingetaucht.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die ganze Nacht sammeln sich die Okkultisten und horchen auf alles, was er im Schlaf sagen möge. So erhält ein Fanatiker auch seinen neuen Namen. Dieser wird dann in einen mit Meerwasser gefüllten Tonkrug eingeritzt. Ich beobachtete die Namen auf einigen dieser Krüge. "Der Gigant Bebt Aber Erwacht Nicht" war einer. "Schütte Blut Von Sklaven In Den Fluss Styx", ein anderer. In dieser Nacht schien das Opfer nichts zu hören, denn er schlief schweigend fast bis zum Morgengrauen. Sollte es dabei bleiben wird das Opfer ertränkt und dient dann in den untoten Legionen der Schatten der Tiefe. Zu seinem Glück, oder vielleicht auch nicht, schrie er letztendlich: "der Entfernte hat wachsame Augen!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Okkultisten nickten sich gegenseitig zu und zogen den Mann aus dem Wasser. Als er sah, wie sie ihn festhielten, zuckte er zusammen. Sie redeten nicht mit ihm, sondern schleiften ihn zurück in den Tempel. Mir war es nicht möglich, ihnen zu folgen, Tage später sah ich den Fanatiker aber in einer meeresfarbenen Robe. Er hatte blutunterlaufene Augen und lief durch eine Menschenmenge auf dem örtlichen Marktplatz, während er in ständigen Selbstgesprächen vertieft war.

		<English>The old Stonewarden was awakened abruptly by a knock on the temple door. He shook the sleep out of his eyes and opened the door, revealing a young man. "Temple services start at evening, my boy," he said.[PARAGRAPH:1]The newcomer mustered his courage. "I want to become a thane, sir."[PARAGRAPH:1]The Stonewarden smiled at the earnestness of his visitor, recalling a time long, long ago when he had made a similar calling. "What time does the smith wake in the morning to light his furnace?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sir? I don't know, I don't want to be a smith, I want to serve Kilmorph!"[PARAGRAPH:1]"How does the merchant keep all his camels moving at the same pace? How does the King decide a man's punishment? How does the miner know where to strike for ore? When must the baker remove his sweet bread to keep it from burning? What does the soldier do to keep his courage up before battle?" The boy stared back at the Stonewarden, who chuckled at last. "Kilmorph does not need service in the temple, youngling, but amongst her people. Work side by side with the smith, to learn his struggles and dreams. Travel with the merchant, and guide him through his temptations. Be beside the soldier as he dies, and the king as he orders the death of a guilty man. We of Kilmorph can mold the community together as the potter shapes the clay, for they will heed your advice only when they know you were once one of them."[PARAGRAPH:1]"How will I know when I am done?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"You will know. Kilmorph will draw you back to me, and I will be ready to teach you how to draw on her power. A Stonewarden is able to move mountains-only when his people share his faith. So go, draw the people to together and to Kilmorph, and when you return the earth itself will do your bidding." The old man watched as his charge left hesitantly, then shuffled back and resumed his nap.[PARAGRAPH:2]From chapter 4 of Reflections on the State Cults, by Elder Methyl of the Luonnotar.</English>

		<German>Der alte Edelsteinwächter wurde plötzlich durch ein Klopfen an der Tempeltür geweckt. Er rieb sich den Schlaf aus den Augen und öffnete die Tür, in der ein junger Mann stand. "Die Tempeldienste beginnen erst am Abend, mein Junge", sagte er. [PARAGRAPH:1]Der Ankömmling nahm seinen Mut zusammen. "Ich möchte ein Lehnsmann werden, Herr" [PARAGRAPH:1]Der Edelsteinwächter musste lächeln, als er die Ernsthaftigkeit im Gesicht seines Besuchers sah. Dies erinnerte ihn daran, wie er selbst vor langer Zeit eine ähnliche Anfrage gestellt hatte. "Zu welcher Zeit erwacht der Schmied am Morgen, um den Schmelzofen anzuzünden?", fragte er. [PARAGRAPH:1] "Herr? Ich ...ich weiß nicht, ich möchte kein Schmied werden. Ich möchte Kilmorph dienen!" [PARAGRAPH:1] "Wie bringt der Händler all seine Kamele dazu, sich in der gleichen Geschwindigkeit zu bewegen? Wie entscheidet der König über die Strafe eines Untertanen? Woher weiß der Bergbauer, an welcher Stelle er nach Erz graben muss? Was tut der Soldat, um seinen Mut vor einer Schlacht zu behalten?" Der junge Mann erwiderte den Blick des Edelsteinwächters, der leise anfing zu Lachen. "Kilmorph benötigt keine Dienste im Tempel, Junge, sondern inmitten seines Volkes. Arbeite Seite an Seite mit dem Schmied, um seine Probleme und seine Träume kennen zu lernen. Reise mit dem Händler und leite ihm den Weg durch seine Versuchungen. Stehe dem Soldaten bei wenn er stirbt und sei neben dem König, wenn er den Tod eines schuldigen Mannes befiehlt. Wir Diener von Kilmorph können die Gemeinde so zusammenwachsen lassen, wie ein Töpfer seinen Ton formt. Daher werden Sie deinem Rat nur dann folgen, wenn Sie wissen, dass Du einst einer von ihnen warst." [PARAGRAPH:1]"Woher werde ich wissen, wenn ich fertig bin?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Du wirst es wissen. Kilmorph wird Dich wieder zu mir führen, und ich werde bereit sein Dir beizubringen, wie Du ihre Macht aufnehmen kannst. Ein Edelsteinwächter kann Berge versetzen - aber nur wenn seine Gemeinde seinen Glauben teilt. Nun geh, führe die Menschen zusammen und zu Kilmorph. Und wenn Du zurückkommst folgt selbst die Erde deinem Gebot." Der alte Mann beobachtete, wie der Anwärter zögernd fort ging. Danach schlurfte er zurück und setze sein Nickerchen fort.[PARAGRAPH:2] - Auszug aus Kapitel 4 der "Reflektionen über Staatsreligionen", verfasst von Ältester Methyl der Luonnatar.</German>

		<German>Alle Geweihten teilen die selben zwei Grundfunktionen: sie verfügen über die seltene "Heilung"-Beförderung, die die Heilung jeder von ihnen begleiteten Einheit beschleunigt, doch vielleicht noch wichtiger ist ihre Fähigkeit, ihre Religion in den eigenen und, falls offene Grenzen bestehen, fremden Städten zu verbreiten. Die Chance auf Erfolg ist dabei um so höher, je weniger Religionen bereits in der Stadt anwesend sind.</German>

It was not the temple that he went to, with its genial looking librarians and philosophical debates, but to an abandoned building some blocks away. The hooded young man opened the door without knocking. Inside was lit only by candles, each giving a different colored glow.[PARAGRAPH:1]Five gnarled old fingers wrapped around his wrist like a vise. Instinct made him struggle, but other Ritualists soon had hold of his shoulders and left arm. "Why have you come?" hissed the Ritualist holding his wrist. The other observed silently.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You told me this was the place, to become one of you."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Not good enough. It must be of your will. Why have you come?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The Savant to be answered again, "I have come to bargain. I offer myself."[PARAGRAPH:1]The Ritualist nodded, and pulled out a knife. Then he slashed the newcomer's palm, and watched as a thin line of blood appeared, soon forming a small pool in this hand. This he spilled into a small, fragrant pile of desiccated herbs. The Savant was released, and he quickly clasped his hands together to staunch the bleeding. Each Ritualist picked up a candle, and together they lit the reagents stained with blood.[PARAGRAPH:1]A small fire appeared, with an overwhelming stench of burning flesh. A deep voice echoed throughout the house. "What can I give you?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The Savant peered into the flames before answering. "I have been ignored, mistreated, and scorned. Give me power to destroy my enemies!"[PARAGRAPH:1]"And what do you offer?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Everything. My life, my wealth, my family, my honor. My soul."[PARAGRAPH:1]"It is done.

Rather, his skin wrinkled and aged before my eyes, the mark traveling up his arms and soon covering his whole body. Then he was released, and he collapsed to the floor. He was still for several minutes, and I thought I heard sobbing.[PARAGRAPH:1]But no, it was laughter. His eyes burned with dark fire. "I feel... so powerful. At last..." was the last thing I heard. He continued laughing as he was roughly stripped and dressed in the robes of a Savant.[PARAGRAPH:2]From chapter 9 of Reflections on the State Cults, by Elder Methyl of the Luonnotar.</English>

		<German>Sich verstohlen umschauend näherte er sich im Schutze der Dunkelheit dem Ritualisten. Es war nicht der Tempel, den er sonst aufsuchte mit seinen großartigen Bibliotheken und philosophischen Debatten, sondern ein verlassenen Gebäude einige Häuserblöcke entfernt. Der verhüllte junge Mann öffnete die Tür ohne anzuklopfen. Das Innere wurde lediglich von Kerzen beleuchtet, jede gab ein andersfarbiges Glimmen ab.[PARAGRAPH:1]Fünf knorrige Finger umschlossen sein Handgelenk wie ein Schraubstock. Instinktiv setzte er sich zur Wehr, doch schon bald hielten andere Ritualisten seine Schulter und seinen linken Arm. "Warum kamst Du hierher?" fauchte der Ritualist, der sein Handgelenk hielt. Die Anderen schauten schweigend zu.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ihr sagtet mir dies wäre der Ort, an dem ich einer von Euch werden könnte."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Das reicht nicht. Es muss Dein eigener Wille sein. Warum kamst Du hierher?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Der werdende Gelehrte versuchte es anders, "Ich kam um zu verhandeln. Ich biete mich selbst an."[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Ritualist nickte und zog ein Messer. Er schlitze die Handfläche des Neulings auf und beobachtete, wie sich ein dünner Blutrinnsal bildete, der kurz darauf eine kleine Lache in seiner Hand bildete. Diese goss er über einen wohlriechenden aber verdörrten Stapel aus Kräutern. Der Anwärter wurde losgelassen und presste seine Hände fest zusammen, um die Blutung zu stillen. Jeder Ritualist nahm eine Kerze zur Hand und gemeinsam entzündeten sie die blutgetränkten Kräuter.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ein kleines Feuer entstand, welches überwältigend nach brennendem Fleisch stank. Eine tiefe Stimme hallte durch das Haus. "Was kann ich Dir geben?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Bevor er antwortete, starrte der neue Gelehrte in die Flammen. "Ich wurde ignoriert, schlecht behandelt und verachtet. Gib mir die Macht, meine Feinde zu vernichten!"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Und was bietest Du?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Alles! Mein Leben, mein Vermögen, meine Familie, meine Ehre. Sogar meine Seele."[PARAGRAPH:1]"So sei es. Du stehst in meiner Gunst und bist aus freiem Willen in meine Dienste getreten. Lasst alle wissen, dass wieder jemand meinem Pfad folgt!" Die Stimme verblasste.[PARAGRAPH:1]Erneut wurde die Hand des Gelehrten von einem Ritualisten ergriffen. Diesmal wurde sie ins Feuer gehalten, was ihn aber nicht verbrannte. Stattdessen runzelte und alterte die Haut der Hand vor seinen Augen. Dieses Mal wanderte es seinen Arm entlang und bedeckte schon bald seinen gesamten Körper. Erneut wurde er losgelassen und diesmal brach er zusammen. Einige Minuten verharrte er und ich meinte, ihn schluchzen zu hören.[PARAGRAPH:1]Aber nein, es war Lachen. Seine Augen glühten wie dunkle Flammen. "Ich fühle mich... so stark. Endlich..." waren die letzten Worte, die ich ihn sagen hörte. Er lachte weiter, während er grob ausgezogen und mit den Roben eines Gelehrten bekleidet wurde.

He was still for several minutes, and I thought I heard sobbing.[PARAGRAPH:1]But no, it was laughter. His eyes burned with dark fire. "I feel... so powerful. At last..." was the last thing I heard. He continued laughing as he was roughly stripped and dressed in the robes of a Savant.[PARAGRAPH:2]From chapter 9 of Reflections on the State Cults, by Elder Methyl of the Luonnotar.</Italian>
		<Spanish>He came to the Ritualists under the cover of darkness, looking furtively around. It was not the temple that he went to, with its genial looking librarians and philosophical debates, but to an abandoned building some blocks away. The hooded young man opened the door without knocking. Inside was lit only by candles, each giving a different colored glow.[PARAGRAPH:1]Five gnarled old fingers wrapped around his wrist like a vise. Instinct made him struggle, but other Ritualists soon had hold of his shoulders and left arm. "Why have you come?" hissed the Ritualist holding his wrist. The other observed silently.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You told me this was the place, to become one of you."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Not good enough. It must be of your will. Why have you come?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The Savant to be answered again, "I have come to bargain. I offer myself."[PARAGRAPH:1]The Ritualist nodded, and pulled out a knife. Then he slashed the newcomer's palm, and watched as a thin line of blood appeared, soon forming a small pool in this hand. This he spilled into a small, fragrant pile of desiccated herbs. The Savant was released, and he quickly clasped his hands together to staunch the bleeding. Each Ritualist picked up a candle, and together they lit the reagents stained with blood.[PARAGRAPH:1]A small fire appeared, with an overwhelming stench of burning flesh. A deep voice echoed throughout the house. "What can I give you?"[PARAGRAPH:1]The Savant peered into the flames before answering. "I have been ignored, mistreated, and scorned. Give me power to destroy my enemies!"[PARAGRAPH:1]"And what do you offer?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Everything. My life, my wealth, my family, my honor. My soul."[PARAGRAPH:1]"It is done. You have favor with Me, and your service has been entered into of your own accord. Let all see another choose my path!" The voice faded.[PARAGRAPH:1]Again the Savant's hand was grabbed by one of the Ritualists. This was held into the fire, which did not burn him.

		<English>The aspiring acolyte was taken to the roof of the basilica or temple, alone with the ranking Confessor. It was a ritual, but one the acolyte had never before observed, and so also a test. Below them lies the city, with its teeming inhabitants. Merchants, soldiers, farmers, laborers, nobles, each on his own task.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Look out, my son," commands the confessor, "and tell me what you see."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Order," replies the young acolyte calmly.[PARAGRAPH:1]The confessor smiles. "How do you see order here? Each man follows his own will."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Order is brought by the law. As we follow the code of Junil, we are able to cooperate with one another, bringing about the ultimate expression of order, civilization. Each man's works contribute to the greater good without him knowing it, so long as those who harbor ill will are constrained by the law."[PARAGRAPH:1]"What is the greatest temptation of the faithful of Junil?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Mercy."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Why?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"The children of mercy are redemption and injustice. To show mercy to the murderer is to show contempt for the slain, and to grant mercy to the thief is to impoverish his victims. The redemption of a foe is the greatest achievement, but by forgiveness without contrition one is only allowing future suffering. The brother who grants mercy to all sees compassion as his strength; in truth pride is his weakness and the seeds of future misery are sown in the community. Thus mercy must remain the discretion of the gods."[PARAGRAPH:1]"And so what is your greatest calling?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Obedience. Unquestioning Obedience." This exchange complete, the acolyte will be bathed and blessed, a full member of the Order.[PARAGRAPH:2]From chapter 2 of Reflections on the State Cults, by Elder Methyl of the Luonnotar.</English>

		<German>Der angehende Akolyt wurde alleine von einem Priester auf das Dach des Tempels geführt. Es war ein Ritual, aber eines, das dem Akolyten nicht bekannt war, aber auch ein Test. Unter ihnen lag die Stadt mit ihren emsigen Bewohnern. Händler, Soldaten, Bauern, Arbeiter, Adelige, alle gingen ihrer Beschäftigung nach.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sieh hin, mein Sohn," befahl der Priester, "und sage mir, was du siehst."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ordnung," antwortete der junge Akolyt ruhig.[PARAGRAPH:1]Der Priester lächelte. "Wie erkennst du hier Ordnung? Ein jeder folgt seinem eigenen Weg."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ordnung erfolgt durch das Gesetz. Da wir dem Kodex von Junil folgen, sind wir in der Lage, miteinander zusammenzuarbeiten. Zivilisation ist der höchste Ausdruck von Ordnung. Jedermann arbeitet für ein höheres Gut ohne es zu kennen, bis auf jene, die dagegen handeln und dafür vom Gesetz gestraft werden."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Worin besteht die größte Versuchung an einen Gläubigen von Junil?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Gnade."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Warum?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Die Kinder der Gnade sind Erlösung und Ungerechtigkeit. Gnade für einen Mörder heißt Geringschätzung des Getöteten, Gnade für den Dieb bedeutet Verarmung für seine Opfer. Die Erlösung ist der Feind der größten Entwicklung, aber auf Vergebung ohne Reue folgt nur zukünftiges Leiden. Jener Bruder, der allen Gnade zu teil werden läßt, sieht Mitleid als seine Stärke. In Wahrheit ist Stolz seine Schwäche und die Samen zukünftigen Unglücks werden in die Gemeinschaft gesät. Denn Gnade muß den Göttern vorbehalten sein."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Und worin siehst du deine größte Herausforderung?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Gehorsam. Unbedingter Gehorsam." Die Befragung war zu Ende, der Akolyt wurde gesalbt und gesegnet und war ab nun Vollmitglied des Ordens.[PARAGRAPH:1] - Auszug aus Kapitel 2 der "Reflektionen über Staatsreligionen", verfasst von Ältester Methyl der Luonnatar.</German>

Bestehend aus wirbelndem Rauch haben sie normalerweise eine menschliche Grösse und Form aber sind bekannt Scherze mit Reisenden zu treiben, in dem sie sich in Flaschen und Lampen verstecken. Ihre ätherische Natur erlaubt ihnen freien Zugang zum Mana, doch viele Dschinns plagen sich nicht mit der für einen nützlichen Zauber benötigten Übung. Selbst wenn sie die Fähigkeiten haben die ihren Meistern fehlen, werden sie oft Antworten auf Rätsel verlangen, bevor sie Kommandos ausführen.
