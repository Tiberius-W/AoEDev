		<English>[TAB]The Amurites have no ancient history, no glorious empire in the Age of Magic to harken back to or trace their lineage from. In terms of civilizations, the Amurites are newcomers on the world stage. Nevertheless, they are a force to be reckoned with, feared by some, and respected by all. Part of that respect stems from the tremendous magical power the Amurite armies command, but no small part of it stems from the incredible story of their genesis.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Amurites call themselves the Children of Kylorin. According to their own legends, the arrival of the archmage Kylorin saved the Amurite people from obscurity, or possibly extinction, during the Age of Ice. Not even the Amurites know exactly why Kylorin picked these people as his chosen folk, but they maintain that it was because of a particular strength of character.[PARAGRAPH:1]Whatever the reason, when Kylorin appeared he changed the fortunes of the tiny, struggling clan that had been the Amurites. For years he lived in their midst, taking new wives as his old ones died of old age or in childbirth, leading the Amurites to a level of organization and advancement unrivalled by any other nation in the Age of Ice. Generations came and went, but Kylorin remained a constant, working towards some arcane goal with the Amurites as his willing and joyous tools. Whether through magic or sheer force of will, he remained young throughout.[PARAGRAPH:1]Until, one day, Kylorin strode out of his home. His face had aged many years, terrible purpose shone in his once soft and kindly eyes, and a magnificent blade hung faintly glowing by his side. With no farewells and no apologies, he went forth into the icy wastes and never came back. Soon after, the Thaw began.[PARAGRAPH:1]He had, however, left behind a powerful gift: his children. Through the years there had been quite a few, and they all carried latent magical abilities. Though the advancement made during the guardianship of the immortal wizard started leaking away during the Thaw, Kylorin's powers remained. Throughout the years, the children of Kylorin intermarried with the rest of the Amurites, and the abilities spread, making the Amurites the civilization that is most magnificently in touch with the magical currents of Erebus.[PARAGRAPH:1]This link has affected every aspect of Amurite life. They run their nation like a great magical school, training as many of their young as possible in, at the very least, basic magic skills. Their schools are so famous, they even attract those with magical abilities from other corners of the globe to join their ranks. The archmages and headmasters of the schools and universities act like an aristocracy in a nation that does not really have one, wielding great political power beyond the walls of their institutions.[PARAGRAPH:1]As with any large collection of scholars, the Amurites are mired in scholarly bureaucracy, the most insipid form of administrative quagmire known to man. The archmages, like professors, are frequently involved in petty squabbles over obscure matters that develop into personal feuds. Positions and knowledge are jealously guarded and hard to obtain; potential rivals are stonewalled at every turn. It is easy to become a mage in the service of the Amurites, but it takes a shrewd, powerful and unscrupulous practitioner of magic to rise to the apex of magical power.[PARAGRAPH:1]Above all, the Amurites have come to worship magic for its own sake. Their fascination with all aspects of magic is so deep that they do not feel hindered by petty alignments and concepts of "good" and "evil." Any avenue of magic can be explored, but some branches, like necromancy, are governed by strict laws and regulations, in order to prevent abuse and disasters. Justice for a mage who ignores these laws and starts dabbling in the regulated branches without obtaining the necessary permission is merciless, final, and in keeping with their fascination with the uses of magic, rather spectacular. No possibility is left for a repeat offense.[PARAGRAPH:1]Since the Amurites do not feel themselves confined by the alignments most nations follow, they are treated with a healthy amount of distrust by good and evil civilizations. Evil civilizations dislike the regulation of the dark and chaotic spheres, good civilizations are worried that they are not forbidden entirely. While not specifically hated by any, they have trouble making truly close allies. However, they don't feel they need any. As long as they are left in peace to conduct their magical experiments, they are happy, and wise rulers respect that. Those few who have crossed the Amurites and felt the fire of their arcane might have no desire to repeat the experience. Many have not been left the option.</English>
		<French>Les Amurites n'ont pas d'histoire ancestrale, pas de glorieux empire de l'Âge de la Magie auquel s'identifier ou s'affilier. En termes de civilisation, les Amurites sont des nouveaux venus sur la scène du monde. Néanmoins, ils sont une force à reconnaitre, craints par certains, et respectés par tous. Une partie de ce respect provient du formidable pouvoir magique que les armées amurites possèdent, mais dont aucune petite partie ne vient de leur incroyable genèse.[PARAGRAPH:1]Les Amurites se nomment eux-mêmes les Enfants de Kylorin. Selon leurs propres légendes, l'arrivée de l'archimage Kylorin sauva le peuple amurite de l'obscurité, ou d'une possible extinction, durant l'Âge de Glace. Même les Amurites ne savent pas exactement pourquoi Kylorin choisit ces gens comme son peuple élu, mais ils maintiennent que ce fut grâce à une force de caractère particulière.[PARAGRAPH:1]Qu'importe les raisons, lorsque Kylorin apparut il changea le destin de ce petit clan s'en sortant difficilement qu'étaient les Amurites. Durant des années il vécu en leur sein, prenant de nouvelles femmes lorsque les vielles décédaient de vieillesse ou en couche, conduisant les Amurites vers un niveau d'organisation et d'avancement incomparable avec toute autre nation de l'Âge de Glace. Les générations vinrent et furent, mais Kylorin resta constant, travaillant sur un projet arcanique avec les Amurites comme cobayes volontaires et réjouis. Que ce soit par la magie ou une volonté d'airain, il resta jeune.[PARAGRAPH:1]jusqu'à ce qu'un jour Kylorin se précipite hors de sa maison. Son visage avait pris de nombreuses années,  une intention terrible reluisant dans ses yeux doux et enfantins et une magnifique lame pendant à son côté. Sans adieux ni excuses, il s'en alla dans les étendues glacées et ne revint jamais. Peu de temps après, le Dégel commença.[PARAGRAPH:1]Mais il laissa derrière lui un puissant cadeau : ses enfants. À travers les ans ils furent relativement nombreux, et tous possédaient un potentiel magique latent. Bien que les progrès accomplis durant le règne du mage immortel commençaient à s'estomper durant le Dégel, la puissance de Kylorin subsistait. Au fil des ans, les enfants de Kylorin se marièrent avec le reste des Amurites, et les capacités se répandirent, faisant des Amurites la civilisation la plus magnifiquement en phase avec les courants magiques d'Erebus.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ce lien affecta bien des aspects de la vie amurite. Ils dirigeaient leur nation comme une grande école de magie, instruisant le plus de jeunes possible dans, au minimum, les compétences magiques basiques. Leurs écoles sont si célèbres qu'ils attirent dans leurs rangs tous ceux avec des capacités magiques des quatre coins du globe. Les Archimages et les Doyens des Écoles et des Universités agissent comme une aristocratie dans une nation qui n'en a pas vraiment, maniant un grand pouvoir politique derrière les murs de leurs institutions.[PARAGRAPH:1]Comme tout grand groupe d'érudits, les Amurites sont embourbés dans une bureaucratie scolaire, le plus insipide des bourbiers administratifs que connaisse l'Homme. Les Archimages, comme professeurs, sont fréquemment impliqués dans de mesquines disputes pour d'obscures raisons qui développent des dissensions personnelles. Les postes et les connaissances sont jalousement gardés et difficiles à obtenir : les rivaux potentiels sont entravés chaque fois que c'est possible. Il est facile de devenir un mage au service des Amurites, mais cela demande l'aide d'un praticien perspicace, puissant et sans scrupules pour atteindre l'apex de la puissance magique.[PARAGRAPH:1]Par dessus tout, les Amurites en sont venus à vénérer la magie pour son propre intérêt. Leur fascination avec tous les aspects de la magie est si profonde qu'ils ne se sentent pas entravés par d'insignifiants alignements ou des concepts de "bien" et de "mal". Toute voie de la magie peut être explorée, mais certaines branches, comme la nécromancie, sont gouvernées par des lois et des réglementations strictes, afin de prévenir les abus et les désastres. La justice pour un mage qui ignore ces lois et commence à barboter dans les branches réglementées sans obtenir la permission nécessaire, est impitoyable, définitive, et restant dans leur fascination des usages de la magie, plutôt spectaculaire. Aucune possibilité de récidive n'est laissée.[PARAGRAPH:1]Parce que les Amurites ne se sentent pas confinés par les alignements que la plupart des nations suivent, ils sont considérés avec une prudente défiance par les civilisations bonnes et mauvaises. Les civilisations du mal détestent la réglementation des sphères sombres et chaotiques, les civilisations du bien inquiétes qu'elles ne soient pas entièrement interdites. Bien qu'ils ne soient réellement haïs par aucun, ils ont du mal à trouver des alliés véritablement proches. De toute façon, ils n'en éprouvent pas le besoin. Aussi longtemps qu'ils restent en paix pour mener leurs expériences magiques, ils sont heureux, et les sages dirigeants respectent cela. Les rares qui ont croisé les Amurites et senti le feu de leurs arcanes n'ont pas le désir de répéter cette expérience. Beaucoup n'ont d'ailleurs jamais eu cette possibilité.</French>
		<German>[TAB]Die gemeinsame Geschichte der Amuriten ist vergleichsweise kurz, es gab kein prächtiges Reich im Zeitalter der Magie, auf das sie zurückblicken oder von dem sie ihre Herkunft ableiten könnten. Im Hinblick auf andere Zivilisationen sind die Amuriten Neulinge auf der Bühne der Welt. Trotzdem sind sie eine ernstzunehmende Macht, die von manchen gefürchtet und von allen respektiert wird. Ein Teil dieses Respekts rührt von der gewaltigen magischen Kraft her, über die die Armeen der Amuriten verfügen, aber ein nicht geringer Teil davon ist auch auf die unglaubliche Geschichte ihrer Entstehung zurückzuführen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Amuriten nennen sich selbst die "Kinder von Kylorin". In ihren Legenden heißt es, dass die Ankunft des Erzmagiers Kylorin das Volk der Amuriten vor dem Vergessen oder gar dem Aussterben während des Zeitalters des Eises bewahrte. Nicht einmal die Amuriten selbst wissen genau, weshalb Kylorin ausgerechnet diese Menschen als sein auserwähltes Volk aussuchte, sie behaupten jedoch, dass es an ihrer Charakterstärke gelägen habe.[PARAGRAPH:1]Aus welchem Grund auch immer, als Kylorin erschien, änderte er das Schicksal des kleinen, ums Überleben kämpfenden Klans, der die Amuriten einst gewesen waren. Für viele Jahre lebte er mitten unter ihnen, nahm sich neue Gemahlinen, wenn eine seiner Frauen an Altersschwäche oder bei der Geburt eines Kindes starb, und führte die Amuriten zu einem Grad der Organisation und des Fortschritts, den keine andere Nation während des Zeitalters des Eises erreichte. Generationen kamen und gingen, aber Kylorin blieb eine feste Größe, während er mit den Amuriten als willige und freudige Werkzeuge auf ein geheimnisvolles Ziel hinarbeitete. Entweder durch Magie oder bloße Willenskraft blieb er die ganze Zeit jung.[PARAGRAPH:1]Bis Kylorin eines Tages seine Heimat verließ. Sein Gesicht war viele Jahre gealtert, schreckliche Entschlossenheit glänzte in seinen einst freundlichen und gütigen Augen und eine prächtige Klinge hing schwach glühend an seiner Seite. Ohne Umschweife und ohne Abschiedsworte schritt er vorwärts in die gefrorene Einöde und kam nie zurück. Kurze Zeit später begann das Große Tauen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Allerdings hatte er ein wertvolles Geschenk zurückgelassen: seine Nachkommen. Während all der Jahre waren sie sehr zahlreich geworden und alle besaßen verborgene magische Fähigkeiten. Obwohl der Fortschritt, der unter dem Schutz des unsterblichen Zauberers erreicht wurde, nun während des Großen Tauens langsam dahinschmolz, blieb Kylorins Macht erhalten. In den folgenden Jahren vermischten sich seine Kinder mit dem Rest der Amuriten und ihre Fähigkeiten verteilten sich unter ihnen, wodurch die Amuriten zu der Zivilisation wurden, die die beste Verbindung zu den magischen Strömen von Erebus herstellen kann.[PARAGRAPH:1]Diese Verbindung hat das Leben der Amuriten in jeder Hinsicht beeinflusst. Sie führen ihr Reich wie eine große magische Schule und unterrichten so viele ihrer Kinder wie möglich mindestens in den Grundlagen der Magie. Ihre Ausbildungsstätten sind so berühmt, dass sogar die magisch Begabtenen aus anderen Winkeln der Welt in ihre Klassen strömen. Die Erzmagier und Leiter der Schulen und Universitäten verhalten sich wie Aristokraten in einer Nation, die eigentlich keine Aristokratie kennt, und besitzen über die Grenzen ihrer Institute hinaus eine große politische Macht.[PARAGRAPH:1]Wie bei jeder Ansammlung von Gelehrten ersticken die Amuriten fast in akademischer Bürokratie, die geistloseste Form des administrativen Sumpfes, die die Menschheit kennt. Die Erzmagier sind wie Professoren immer wieder in kleinlichen Streitereien über unbedeutende Angelegenheiten verstrickt, die nicht selten in persönliche Fehden ausarten. Posten und Wissen werden eifersüchtig gehütet und nur schwer zu erringen; mögliche Rivalen werden immer wieder abgeblockt. Es ist einfach, als Magier in die Dienste der Amuriten aufgenommen zu werden, aber es bedarf eines gerissenen, mächtigen und skrupellosen Anwenders der Magie, um in die Höhen der magischen Macht aufzusteigen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Die Amuriten beten die Magie vor allem um ihrer selbst willen an. Ihre Faszination für alle Aspekte der Magie ist so stark, dass sie sich nicht an kleinliche Gesinnungen und die Konzepte von "Gut" und "Böse" gebunden fühlen. Jeder Weg der Magie kann erforscht werden, aber einige Zweige wie die Nekromantie werden durch strenge Gesetze und Regulierungen beschränkt, um Missbrauch und Unfälle zu vermeiden. Die Bestrafung für einen Zauberer, der diese Gesetze ignoriert und sich ohne die nötige Genehmigung in den regulierten Zweigen der Magie versucht, ist gnadenlos, endgültig und, in Einklang mit ihrer Faszination für die Anwendungen der Magie, auch ziemlich spektakulär. Die Möglichkeit eines erneuten Verstoßes wird gar nicht erst zugelassen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Da sich die Amuriten nicht durch die Gesinnungen beschränken lassen, denen sich die meisten Nationen anschließen, werden sie sowohl von guten als auch von bösen Zivilisationen mit einer gesunden Portion Misstrauen beäugt. Den bösen Zivilisationen missfallen die Vorschriften für die dunklen und chaotischen Sphären der Magie, während die guten Zivilisationen beunruhigt sind, dass diese nicht vollkommen verboten sind. Zwar werden sie von niemandem wirklich gehasst, trotzdem haben sie Probleme, wirklich enge Verbündete zu finden. Allerdings haben sie auch nicht das Gefühl, diese unbedingt nötig zu haben. Solange sie in Frieden gelasssen werden, um ihre magischen Experimente durchführen zu können, sind sie zufrieden und weise Anführer respektieren das. Jene wenigen, die sich mit den Amuritern angelegt und das Feuer ihrer magischen Macht verspürt haben, haben kein Verlangen danach diese Erfahrung zu wiederholen. Viele erhielten diese Möglichkeit gar nicht.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]Gli Amurite non hanno una storia antica e nessun glorioso impero dell'Era della Magia da ricostruire o da cui possono dire di discendere. In termini di civiltà, gli Amurite sono arrivati da poco sulla scena mondiale. Nonostante ciò, non sono da sottovalutare, temuti da alcuni e rispettati da tutti. Parte di questo rispetto deriva dall'enorme potere magico che gli eserciti Amurite possiedono, l'altra parte deriva dall'incredibile storia delle loro origini.[PARAGRAPH:1]Gli Amurite chiamano se stessi Figli di Kylorin. Secondo le loro leggende l'arrivo dell'arcimago Kylorin salvò gli Amurite dall'oscurità, e la probabile estinzione, durante l'Era del Ghiaccio. Neppure gli Amurite sanno esattamente perché Kylorin scelse quelle persone come suo popolo prediletto, ma sono convinti che fosse per via di una particolare forza di carattere.[PARAGRAPH:1]Qualunque fosse la ragione, quando Kylorin arrivò cambiò le sorti dei piccoli clan in difficoltà che erano gli Amurite. Per anni visse in mezzo a loro, prendendo nuove mogli quando quelle precedenti morivano di vecchiaia o di parto, portando gli Amurite a un livello di organizzazione e sviluppo irraggiungibili dalle altre civiltà nell'Era del Ghiaccio. Le generazioni passavano, ma Kylorin rimaneva una costante, mentre lavorava verso qualche arcano obiettivo con gli Amurite come suoi strumenti volenterosi e gioiosi. Che fosse attraverso la magia o pura forza di volontà, lui rimase sempre giovane.[PARAGRAPH:1]Fino a quando, un giorno, Kylorin uscì da casa sua. Il suo volto invecchiato di molti anni, con una terribile risolutezza che brillava nei suoi occhi, un tempo dolci e gentili, e una magnifica spada, che emanava una flebile luce, appesa al fianco. Senza addii e senza scuse, si diresse verso le lande ghiacciate senza far mai più ritorno. Poco dopo, il Disgelo iniziò.[PARAGRAPH:1]Aveva, però, lasciato dietro di se un potente dono: i suoi figli. Nel corso degli anni ce ne furono parecchi, e tutti loro avevano capacità magiche latenti. Sebbene lo sviluppo ottenuto durante la tutela dello stregone immortale iniziò a venir meno durante il Disgelo, i poteri di Kylorin rimaserò. Nel corso degli anni, i figli di Kylorin si imparentarono con il resto degli Amurite, e le capacità magiche si diffusero, rendendo gli Amurite la civiltà più in sintonia di tutte con le correnti magiche di Erebus.[PARAGRAPH:1]Questo legame ha influenzato ogni aspetto della vita degli Amurite. Gestiscono la loro nazione come fosse una grande scuola di magia, istruendo quanti più giovani riescono nelle, come minimo, abilità magiche di base. Le loro scuole sono cosi famose, che attirano coloro con capacità magiche persino dagli altri angoli del mondo per unirsi ai loro ranghi. Gli arcimaghi e dirigenti delle scuole e università agiscono come un'aristocrazia in una nazione in cui non c'è ne veramente una, esercitando un grande potere politico oltre le mura delle loro istituzioni.[PARAGRAPH:1]Come con qualsiasi gruppo di studiosi, gli Amurite sono impantanati nella burocrazia accademica, la forma più insulsa dei pantani amministrativi conosciuta all'uomo. Gli arcimaghi, come i professori, sono frequentemente coinvolti in piccoli litigi riguardo materie oscure che degenerano in faide personali. Cariche e conoscenze sono gelosamente custodite e difficili da ottenere; i potenziali rivali sono ostacolati ad ogni opportunità. È facile diventare un mago al servizio egli Amurites, ma bisogna essere utilizzatori della maglia scaltri, potenti e senza scrupoli per salire all'apice del potere magico.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sopra di tutto, gli Amurite hanno iniziato a venerare la magia fine a se stessa. Il loro interesse per tutti gli aspetti della magia e cosi profondo che non si sentono ostacolati da insignificanti allineamenti e concetti come "buono" e "malvagio". Ogni via della magia può essere esplorata, ma alcuni rami, come la necromanzia, sono regolamentati da leggi e regole severe, in maniera da prevenire abusi e disastri. La punizione per un mago che ignora queste leggi e inizia a dilettarsi nei rami regolamentati senza aver ottenuto le autorizzazioni necessarie è spietata, inappellabile, e in linea con questo loro interesse per l'uso della magia, parecchio spettacolare. Non viene lasciato spazio alla recidività.[PARAGRAPH:1]Siccome gli Amurites non si sentono limitati dagli allineamenti che la maggior parte delle nazioni seguono, vengono trattati con una sana dose di diffidenza da parte delle civiltà sia "buone" che "cattive". Le civilità malvagie disprezzano le regolamentazioni delle sfere oscure e caotiche, le civiltà buone sono preoccupate dal fatto che non sono proibite interamente. Sebbene non siano odiati specificatamente da qualcuno, hanno difficolta ad avere alleati fidati. Comunque, loro non ne sentono il bisogno. Fino a quando verranno lasciati in pace a condurre i loro esperimenti magici, loro sono felici, e i sovrani saggi rispettano ciò. I pochi che hanno intralciato gli Amurites e provato sulla pelle la loro potenza arcana non hanno alcuna intenzione di ripetere l'esperienza. A molti non è stata lasciata questa opzione.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[TAB]Los Amurites no tienen una historia antigua, ni un glorioso imperio de la Edad de la Magia desde el que remontarse ni una línea de sangre que seguir. En términos de civilización, los Amurites son nuevos en el escenario mundial. Sin embargo, son una fuerza a tener en cuenta, temidos por algunos, y respetados por todos. Parte de ese respeto proviene del tremendo poder mágico de los ejércitos Amurites, pero tampoco es pequeña la parte que proviene de la increible historia de su génesis.[PARAGRAPH:1]Los Amurites se llaman a sí mismos los hijos de Kylorin. Acorde a sus propias leyendas, la llegada del archimago Kylorin salvó al pueblo Amurite de la oscuridad, y posiblemente de la extinción, durante la Edad de Hielo. Ni siquiera los Amurites saben exactamente porqué Kylorin optó por esta gente como sus hermanos elegidos, pero mantienen que fue por una particular fuerza de carácter.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sea cual sea la razón, cuando Kylorin apareció, cambió la fortuna del pequeño y afanado clan que era el de los Amurites. Durante años vivió entre ellos, tomando nuevas esposas cuando sus antiguas morían de vejez o dando a luz, llevando a los Amurites hacia un nivel de organización y desarrollo sin posible rivalidad de otra civilización en la Edad de Hielo. Generaciones vienieron y se fueront, pero Kylorin permaneció constante, trabajando por un objetivo arcano con los Amurites como sus herramientas deseosas y entusiasmadas. Ya sea por la magia o por pura fuerza de voluntad, él permaneció jóven a lo largo del tiempo.[PARAGRAPH:1]Hasta que, un día, Kylorin salió de su casa a zancadas. Su cara había envejecido muchos años, con un terrible propósito brillando en sus una vez suaves y joviales ojos, y colgada a su lado una magnífica espada brillando tenuemente. Sin despedidas ni disculpas, se fue decidido hacia las extensiones de hielo y nunca volvió. Poco después, comenzó el Deshielo.[PARAGRAPH:1]Había, sin embargo, dejado atrás un poderoso don: sus hijos.  Con los años han habido unos pocos, y todos ellos llevaban habilidades mágicas latentes. Aunque los avances hechos durante la vigía del hechicero inmortal empezaron a desvanecerse durante el Deshielo, los poderes de Kylorin permanecieron. A lo largo de los años, los hijos de Kylorin se entremezclaron con el resto de los Amurites, y las habilidades se propagaron, convirtiendo a los Amurites en la civilización más enormemente innata a la magia de Erebus.[PARAGRAPH:1]Esta línea ha afectado a cada aspecto de la vida Amurite. Dirigieron a su nación como una gran escuela de magia, entrenando a tantos jóvenes como fue posible hasta en las más básicas habilidades mágicas. Sus escuelas con tan famosas que incluso atraen a aquellos con habilidades mágicas desde otros rincones del globo para unirse a sus filas. Los Archimagos y Profesores de las Escualas y las Universidades actúan como una aristocracia en una nación que siquiera tiene una, manejando un gran poder político más allá de los muros de sus instituciones.[PARAGRAPH:1]Como una gran colección de escolares, los Amurites están atrapados en burocracia escolar, la forma más insípida de atolladero administrativo conocido por el hombre. Los Archimagos, como profesores, se envuelven frecuentemente en nimias disputas acerca de materias obscuras que terminan en feudos personales. Las posiciones y el conocimiento están celosamente guardados y difíciles de obtener; los rivales potenciales son desbancados a la mínima oportunidad. Es fácil convertirse en mago al servicio de los Amurites, pero requiere una práctica sagaz, potente y escrupulosa de magia para alcanzar la cúspide del poder mágico.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sobretodo, los Amurites han llegado a adorar la magia para su beneficio. Su fascinación por todos los aspectos de la magia es tan profunda que no se sienten atados por meros alineamientos y conceptos del "bien" y del "mal". Cualquier vía de la magia puede ser explorada, pero algunas ramas, como la nigromancia, son gobernadas por estrictas leyes y regulaciones, con el objeto de prevenir abusos y desastres. La justicia para un mago que ignora estas leyes y empieza a aficionarse a las ramas reguladas sin obtener el permiso necesario es implacable, definitiva, y en consonancia con su fascinación en los usos de la magia, también espectacular. No hay posibilidad para una ofensa repetida.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ya que los Amurites no se sienten confinados por los alineamientos que siguen la mayoría de las civilizaciones, son tratados con una saludable cantidad de desconfianza por las civilizaciones buenas y malvadas. Las malvadas discrepan en las regulaciones de las esferas oscuras y caóticas, y a las buenas les preocupa que no las hayan abolido por completo. Aunque no son odiados de manera específica por ninguna, tienen problemas a la hora de hacer verdaderos aliados. Sin embargo, no sienten la necesidad de ninguno. Siempre y cuando sean dejados en paz para conducir sus experimentos mágicos, serán felices, y los dirigentes sabios lo respetan. Aquellos que se interpusieron con los Amurites y sintieron el fuego de su poder arcano no sienten el deseo de repetir la experiencia. Algunos no llegaron a tener opción.</Spanish>

		<English>Strategy:

1) The Amurites excel at making the most of magic. Most units they create start with at least some spells in their toolbelt and can use them to devastating effect.

2) With their [LINK=BUILDING_CAVE_OF_ANCESTORS]Cave of Ancestors[\LINK] and [LINK=BUILDING_WIZARDS_HALL]Wizards Hall[\LINK], they are able to give their adepts extra starting experience for every mana resource they have access to and a chance for free spell promotions for any unit created in that city, provided they have the mana for that spell type.

3) The Amurite hero, [LINK=UNIT_GOVANNON]Govannon[\LINK], is able to teach every T1 spell they know to any units on the same tile.

4) The Amurite world spell, [LINK=SPELL_ARCANE_LACUNA]Arcane Lacuna[\LINK], is an extremely powerful tool available at Arcane Lore that shuts off all other players' spellcasting for around 20 turns and grants all your arcane units a boost of experience.

5) Key units of the Amurites include: their Champion replacement the [LINK=UNIT_SPELLSWORD]SpellSword[\LINK] (available with arcane lore), their Longbow replacement, the [LINK=UNIT_FIREBOW]Firebow[\LINK], who can launch arrows and fireballs in equal measure, and finally their Archmage replacement, the [LINK=UNIT_BATTLEMAGE]Battlemage[\LINK], who is able to wade into battle with metal weapon promotions.

6) Another key unit is their Fort Commander, the [LINK=UNIT_TOWER_MAGE]Tower Mage[\LINK]. With access to Channeling II without needing to research any tech, they can use spells like Fire II - [LINK=SPELL_FIREBALL]Fireball[\LINK] to support a larger area than other forts. They can also use abilities like Metamagic I - [LINK=SPELL_FLOATING_EYE]Floating Eye[\LINK] to reveal large parts of the map. Be aware that they lack other Fort Commanders' bonuses versus melee and mounted units!

7) If you are playing one of the Emergent leaders-[LINK=LEADER_KAHD]Kahd[\LINK], [LINK=LEADER_NAXUS]Naxus[\LINK], [LINK=LEADER_LORELEI]Lorelei[\LINK], or [LINK=LEADER_TYA]Tya[\LINK]-you may wish to inspect their leader traits to see how they change the faction's abilities and units.</English>

		<German>Strategie: Die besten Magier der Welt kommen von den Amuritern.

Technology was fascinating stuff, although Dain had never really had the time to learn anything beyond the basic tricks of how it functioned.[PARAGRAPH:1]Although he was greatly impressed by the men who could use mechanics to do such amazing things, he did not see the point. Why build these elaborate things to work your way around the laws of nature when it was so much easier to simply manipulate the laws themselves?[PARAGRAPH:1]He did realize, however, that magic and its practitioners were something of a rare commodity, making these toys and parlor tricks necessary. Magic could solve everything, but it was often easier to do without. Just press a button, or pull a lever, and it happened. No need for great feats of concentration, time-consuming runes or incantations.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dain remembered the time he had spent as a siege-mage-as human artillery, he corrected himself-in the wars. It had been sheer misery. He remembered the smell of blood, and sweat, of soiled garments and fear. The wails of the wounded, the clamor of battle all too close, and the cold, squalid, wet camps where the Amurite mages, weak as they were in hand-to-hand combat, huddled, waiting to be made use of where no device man's ingenuity would suffice. Above all, Dain remembered the unease, the overhanging feeling that they would never get out of the whole mess alive.[PARAGRAPH:1]Still, Dain would not have things differently. Advanced war magic with extremely well-trained mages wielding it meant the Amurites had the luxury of foregoing cumbersome and time-consuming heavy siege engines. It provided them their edge in wars and allowed them to survive and prevail in fights with much more powerful foes. Sometimes, their magic was all that was keeping them alive.[PARAGRAPH:1]You couldn't expect to go anywhere in the Amurite magical hierarchy if you did not have the courage to spend time in the wars. It was a form of... job requirement. And so, Dain had fought, killed, suffered and survived, survived the wars, and survived his colleagues. He had laboriously struggled to the top, and now, at the end of it all, he sat playing with the bits of a clockwork astronomical device. The dwarves were exceptionally good at making these knick-knacks, Dain knew. The Khazad powered their mines with them, the Luchuirp combined them with magic, to give them life, of a sort.[PARAGRAPH:1]Could this mesmerizing object, this soul-less, functional bit of cunningly-fashioned metal, bound by laws stricter than any of man's imagining, constitute a threat to him and his people? Even the most lowly Amurite was, to some extent, above the law![PARAGRAPH:1]He shook his head. He was becoming distracted and distant. He had become so used to losing his concentration like this that he was no longer sure it whether it had started as an affectation to lull his opponents or a handy personality trait that he had deftly exploited. Looking around the scantly-furnished room, he realized that the sun was a lot lower than it should have been.[PARAGRAPH:1]Feeling a pang of regret at dismantling the time-piece, he swept from his chamber. That, at least, was one thing at which cogs and gears would always best him. Keeping time.</English>
		<French>Il jouait avec les pièces d'un mécanisme d'horlogerie, les mélangeant sur le plan de travail, soulevant une roue dentée et la placant sur une aiguille, puis lui donnant une pichenette pour al faire tourner. La technologie était quelque chose de fascinant, même si Dain n'avait jamais vraiment eu le temps d'en apprendre autre chose que les bases.[PARAGRAPH:1]Même s'il était réellement impressionné par les hommes capables de manipuler des mécanismes pour réaliser de telles choses, il n'en voyait pas l'intérêt.Pourquoi construire ces choses compliquées pour fonctionner selon les lois de la nature quand il est tellement plus simple de manipuler ces lois elles-mêmes ?[PARAGRAPH:1]Il se rendait toutefois compte que la magie et ses utilisateurs étaient quelque chose de rare, rendant ces jouets et bibelots de salon nécessaires. La magie pouvait tout résoudre, mais il était souvent plus facile de s'en passer. Vous n'avez qu'à pousser sur un bouton, tirer sur un levier et ça se produisait. Pas besoin de réaliser des prodiges de concentration, de runes ou d'incantations chronophages.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dain se souvenait du temps où il était un mage de siège (enfin, une artillerie humaine plutôt) lors des guerres. C'était un tempsde misère pure. Il se souvenait de l'odeur du sang, de la sueur, des habits souillés et de la peur. Les gémissements des blessés, les clameurs descombats bien trop proches, et les froids, sordides et humides camps où les mages amurites, faibles qu'ils étaient au corps à corps, s'entassaient, attendant d'être utilisés lorsqu'aucun engin ingénieux ne pouvait suffire. Par-dessus tout, Dain se souvenait du malaise, l'épée de Damocles de la sensation qu'ils ne se sortiraient jamais de cette pagaille vivants.[PARAGRAPH:1]Et pourtant, Dain ne voudrait pas faire les choses autrement. La magie de guerre avancée portée par des mages extrêmement bien entrainés signifiait que les Amurites possédaient les avantages de ces lourdes machines de guerres encombrantes et longues à mettre en place. Elle leur fournissait un avantage guerrier et leur permettait de survivre et dominer face à des adversaires bien plus puissants. Parfois, leur magie était la seule chose qui les maintenait en vie.[PARAGRAPH:1]Il était impensable de s'élever dans la hiérarchie magique amurite sans avoir le courage de passer du temps en guerre. C'était une sorte de... d'entretien d'embauche. Et Dain avait combattu, tué, souffert et survécu, survécu aux guerres et à ses collègues. Il s'était laborieusement hissé jusqu'au sommet, et maintenant, au final, il se trouvait assis en train de jouer avec le mécanisme d'un outil astronomique. Les nains excellaient à fabriquer ces bibelots, Dain le savait. Les Khazads aliementaient leurs mines avec, les Luchuirps les combinaient à l'aide de la magie pour leur donner vie d'une certaien manière.[PARAGRAPH:1]Se pouvait-il que cet objet hypnotique, ce morceau de métal sans âme, cette bribe de métal fonctionnel astucieusement travaillé, lié par des lois plus strictes que tout ce qu'on pourrait imaginer, représente une menace pour lui et son peuple ? Même le plus insignifiant des Amurites était, d'une certaine manière, au-dessus des loi ![PARAGRAPH:1]Il secoua la tête. Il devenait distant et distrait. Il s'était tellement habitué à perdre ainsi sa concentration qu'il n'était plus sûr de savoir si ça avait commencé comme une comédie pour tromper ses ennemis ou comme un trait de caractère utile qu'il avait adroitement exploité. Balayant du regard la pièce trop peu meublée, il réalisa que le soleil était bien plus bas que prévu.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ressantant des regrets à avoir démantelé la pièce d'horlogerie, il sorti de sa chambre. C'était au mois une chose pour laquelle les roues et dents d'engrenages étaient meilleures que lui. Surveiller le temps.</French>
		<German>[TAB]Er spielte mit den Teilen des Uhrwerks, verteilte sie auf der Arbeitsfläche, nahm ein Zahnrad und steckte es auf eine Nadel, und gab ihm einen kleinen Stoß, um es drehen zu lassen. Technologie war eine fantastische Sache, obwohl Dain nie wirklich Zeit gehabt hatte, mehr als die Grundsätze zu lernen, nach denen sie funktionierte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Obwohl er sehr beeindruckt von den Menschen war, die Mechanik benutzen konnten, um so faszinierende Dinge zu tun, verstand er nicht, warum. Warum sollte man solche komplizierten Sachen bauen, um die Gesetze der Natur zu überlisten, wenn es so viel einfacher war, die Gesetze selbst zu beeinflussen?[PARAGRAPH:1]Er verstand natürlich, dass Magie und ihre Anwender eine seltene Ware waren, was diese Spielzeuge und Zaubertricks notwendig machte. Magie konnte alle Probleme lösen, aber es war meist einfacher, ohne sie auszukommen. Man drückte einfach nur einen Knopf, oder zog einen Hebel, und es geschah. Ohne große Aufwendungen an Konzentration, zeitraubenden Runen oder Anrufungen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dain erinnerte sich an die Zeit, in der er als Belagerungsmagier - als menschliche Artillerie, korrigierte er sich selbst - in den Kriegen gedient hatte. Es war grauenhaft gewesen. Er erinnerte sich an den Geruch von Blut und Schweiß, von besudelter Kleidung und Angst. Die Klagen der Verwundeten, das zu nahe Kampfgeschrei, und die kalten, schmutzigen, nassen Lager, wo die Magier der Amuriter, die für den Nahkampf zu schwach waren, durcheinander liefen, und darauf warteten, gebraucht zu werden, wo keine Erfindung des menschlichen Geistes von Nutzen sein konnte. Am stärksten erinnerte sich Dain an das Unbehagen, das immer vorhandene Gefühl, dass sie aus diesem Durcheinander nie lebend entkommen würden. [PARAGRAPH:1]Und trotzdem hätte es Dain nicht anders gewollt. Fortgeschrittene Kriegsmagie mit hervorragend ausgebildeten Magiern, die sie wirkten, versicherte den Amuritern den Luxus, lästige und zeitraubende schwere Belagerungsgeräte zu vermeiden. Sie lieferte ihnen ihre Stärke im Krieg, und ermöglichte ihnen, in Kämpfen gegen viel stärkere Feinde, zu überleben und zu siegen. Manchmal war ihre Magie das einzige, das sie am Leben hielt. [PARAGRAPH:1]Man konnte nicht erwarten, auch nur ein bisschen in der Magier-Hierarchie der Amuriter aufzusteigen, wenn man nicht den Mut hatte, eine Zeit lang in den Kriegen zu dienen. Es war eine Art von... Berufsvoraussetzung. Und so hatte Dain gekämpft, getötet, gelitten, und überlebt, die Kriege und seine Kollegen. Er hatte sich mühevoll zur Spitze emporgearbeitet, und nun, am Ende, saß er hier, und spielte mit den Teilen einer mechanischen, astronomischen Erfindung. Die Zwerge waren besonders gut darin, solche Spielereien zu machen, das wusste Dain. Die Khazad betrieben mit ihnen ihre Minen, und die Luichurp kombinierten sie mit Magie, um ihnen Leben einer bestimmten Art einzuhauchen. [PARAGRAPH:1]Konnte dieses hypnotisierende Objekt, dieses seelenlose, funktionelle Stück aus findig verarbeitetem Metall, von Gesetzen beherrscht werden, die strenger waren, als sie sich ein Mensch ausdenken könnte, eine Drohung für ihn und sein Volk darstellen? Selbst die niedrigsten Amuriter befanden sich, bis zu einem gewissen Punkt, über dem Gesetz! [PARAGRAPH:1]Er schüttelte seinen Kopf. Er war zu abgelenkt, und zu abwesend. Er hatte sich schon so daran gewöhnt, auf diese Weise seine Konzentration zu verlieren, dass er nicht mehr lange sicher war, ob das als eine Eigenschaft, seine Feinde in Sicherheit zu wiegen, oder als eine praktische persönliche Eigenschaft, die er weitgehend ausgenutzt hatte, begonnen hatte. Als er sich in dem notdürftig möbliertem Zimmer umsah, merkte er, dass die Sonne um einiges niedriger stand, als sie hätte stehen sollen. [PARAGRAPH:1]Er fühlte einen Stich von Bedauern, als er den Zeitmess-Teil zerlegte, und eilte aus seiner Kammer. Zumindest das war etwas, worin ihn Zahnräder und Federn immer übertreffen würden: Pünktlichkeit.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]Giocherellava con i pezzi di un meccanismo ad orologeria, trascinandoli sul tavolo, sollevando una ruota dentata e montandoci sopra un perno, per poi darli un colpetto facendola girare. La tecnologia era una cosa affascinante, sebbene Dain non ha mai avuto veramente il tempo per imparare qualcosa oltre alle basi del suo funzionamento.[PARAGRAPH:1]Benché fosse molto impressionato dagli uomini che usavano la meccanica per fare cose cosi incredibili, non ne vedeva il senso. Perché costruire queste cose complicate per aggirare le leggi della natura quando è molto più semplice manipolare le leggi stesse?[PARAGRAPH:1]Si rendeva conto, però, che la magia e coloro che la praticano erano una sorta di merce rara, rendendo questi giocattoli e trucchi da salotto necessari. La magia può risolvere tutto, ma spesso era più facile farne a meno. Basta premere un pulsante, o tirare una leva, e succedeva. Non c'è bisogno di grandi imprese di concentrazione, rune che prendono tempo o incantesimi.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dain ricordò il periodo che ha passato come mago da assedio, come artiglieria umana, si corresse, in guerra. Era stata pura tristezza. Ricordò l'odore del sangue, del sudore, di indumenti sporchi e della paura. I lamenti dei feriti, i rumori della battaglia troppo vicini, e i freddi, squallidi e umidi campi dove i maghi Amurite, deboli nel combattimento corpo a corpo, si ammucchiavano, in attesa di essere usati dove nessuno strumento dell'ingegno umano sarebbe bastato. Soprattutto, Dain ricordò il disagio, la costante sensazione che non sarebberò usciti vivi da tutto quello.[PARAGRAPH:1]Eppure, Dain non vorrebbe fossero diverse. La magia della guerra avanzata insieme a maghi estremamente ben addestrati che la padroneggiano significa che gli Amurites non hanno bisogno di ingombranti e lente macchine d'assedio. Ciò gli forniva un vantaggio in guerra e gli permise di sopravvivere e prevalere in scontri contro avversari molto più forti. A volte, la loro magia era ciò che li teneva in vita.[PARAGRAPH:1]Non potevi aspettarti di andare molto avanti nella gerarchia magica degli Amurite se non hai il coraggio di passare del tempo in guerra. Era una sorta di... requisito per il lavoro. E cosi, Dain ha combattuto, ucciso, sofferto e sopravvissé, sopravissé alle guerre, e sopravvisse ai suoi colleghi. Aveva faticosamente lottato per raggiungere la cima, e ora, alla fine di tutto, era seduto a giocare con i pezzi di un meccanismo ad orologeria astronomico. I nani erano incredibilmente bravi a creare questi gingilli, Dain sapeva. I Khazad meccanizavano le loro miiere con essi, i Luchuirp li univano alla magia, per dargli una sorta di vita.[PARAGRAPH:1]Questo affascinante oggetto senza anima, fatto da pezzi di metallo intelligentemente lavorati, e legato da leggi più severe di quanto mai immaginato da un'uomo, poteva costituire una minaccia per lui e la sua gente? Persino l'Amurite più umile era, in una certa misura, al di sopra di quella legge![PARAGRAPH:1]Scosse la testa. Stava diventando distratto e distante. Si era cosi abiutuato a perdere la concentrazione come adesso che non era più sicuro che fosse iniziato tutto come un'ostentazione per far rilassare l'avversario o un pratico tratto della sua personalità che aveva abilmente sfruttato. Guardandosi intorno nella stanza scarsamente arredata, si accorse che il sole era molto più in basso di quanto avrebbe dovuto essere.[PARAGRAPH:1]Provando un pò di rammarico per l'aver smontato il segna tempo, uscì rapidamente dalla sua stanza. Quello, almeno, era una cosa su cui gli ingranaggi lo avrebberò sempre battuto. Tener conto del tempo.</Italian>

		<English>When an Amurite comes of age, they usually choose a sphere of magic that matches their intent. A battlemage, for instance, often chooses Fire magic, for its potential for destruction. However, for the inhabitants of the Iltanie Islands, water reigns supreme. These islanders follow the path of the Hydromancer, with most aspiring to follow in the footsteps of Lorelei Coral, the greatest Hydromancer of the Age.[PARAGRAPH:2]"The Elves have no navy to speak of, the problem is their Lanun mercenaries" said Admiral Akurl, addressing the war council.

"Then I will destroy the fleet myself"[NEWLINE]Akurl felt like laughing, but one look at the woman caused him to change his mind. "Maybe you can"[NEWLINE]Late during the night, a storm blew up out of nowhere. Rain sleeted down, waves tall as hills flipped ships, yet strangely, there was little wind, no lightning, and some of the few surviving Lanun claimed they could see the stars clearly.

		<Italian>Quando un Amurite diventa maggiorenne, di solito scelgono una sfera di magia che coincide con le loro intenzioni. Un mago da battaglia, per esempio, spesso sceglie la magia del Fuoco, per il suo potenziale distruttivo. Invece, per gli abitanti delle Isole Iltanie, l'acqua regna suprema. Questi isolani seguono la via dell'Idromante, con la maggior parte degli aspiranti che le orme Lorelei Coral, la più grande Idromante di quest'Era.[PARAGRAPH:2]"Gli Elfi non hanno una marina militare, il problema sono i loro mercenari Lanun" disse l'Ammiraglio Akurl, parlando al consiglio di guerra. "Se i vascelli Lanun possono essere gestiti, le navi elfiche non saranno un problema per i nostri Cavalieri del Vento."[NEWLINE]"E riguardo la flotta Jotnar?" chiese un generale in fondo alla stanza.[NEWLINE]"Troppo lontana per essere una minaccia" rispose l'ammiraglio, scuotendo la testa. "Nessuno dei nostri maghi è abbastanza potente da attaccare le navi direttamente, hanno qualche dispositivo di smorzamento magico Mechanos."[NEWLINE]"Cosa succede se attacchiamo l'acqua?" chiese una leggera voce femminile dalla folla.[NEWLINE]Akurl aggrotto le sopraciglia, qualcosa di quella voce lo innervosiva. "Capisco la tua logica, ma nessuno dei nostri maghi è abbastanza potente per fare ciò."[NEWLINE]Un esile ragazza vestita con una veste uscì dalla folla. Sorrise lievemente. "Allora distruggerò la flotta da sola"[NEWLINE]Ad Akurl venne da ridere, ma dando un'occhiata alla ragazza cambiò idea. "Forse tu puoi"[NEWLINE]Più tardi durante la notte, una tempesta comparì dal nulla. La pioggia cadeva forte, le onde, alte quanto delle colline, ribaltarono le navi, eppure stranamente, non c'era quasi vento, ne fulmini, e alcuni dei pochi sopravvisuti Lanun sostennerò che potevano vedere le stelle in cielo distintamente. Poco dopo, Lorelei Coral fu nominata menbro del consiglio degli Arcimaghi con la personale raccomandazione si della Regina Valledia e di Caswallen Dain.</Italian>

		<English>[PARAGRAPH] I was lost in darkness, numb to the touch of the rough stone floor I was pressed against. The final skeleton drew closer but his rattling bones dimmed in my ears. All that remained was the burning pain of my body pushed past its limits. I struggled to breathe, but the curse held me tight against the ground. I willed myself alive. Demanded that my hollow body move. My hands scraped across the floor for my staff, and I realized again that it was too far away. There was a time before I was born when I was not alive, would it be the same after my death? Was life only a short breath between twin eternities? There was no magic left in me, my mastery of entropy and dimensions was lost, a brilliant book with the last page turned. My energy had been spent defeating the golem, the blinding aurealis, and the rest of the skeletons. Powerful spells of unmaking and the between. Now I have only enough energy for adepts tricks, to sense the world through the dominions I had mastered. Dark winds whispered to me. Told me of the skeleton's weaknesses, showed me his brittle bones, his clumsy gait and the predictable swing of his pitted sword. He was a collection of vulnerabilities, but he would still kill me. If only I had my spellstaff. I spent months binding my spirit to it, investing my energy in the smooth wood so that in times like these I could draw it out. I could see it laying discarded on the floor, its dim blue glow lighting the chamber. I tried to reach it, but my body refused to move. I had rushed through the door to escape the skeleton, missed the rune, and now it bound me to the ground as if chains weighed at each part of me. Darkness returned and I was grateful I wouldn't bear timid, struggling witness to my own murder. I dreamed I was again a girl running among the flowers of Litha temple. I could feel the grass under my bare feet and smell the wild mix of flowers that bloomed in the eternal summer of the garden. The touch of smooth mahogany drew me back, the touch of my staff cupped inside my hand. The skeleton was so close his wobbling knees were all I could see, his sword was raised to strike. Though my body ignored my demands my will responded and I drew upon the staff's power. As a thing alive it reached out of me and swallowed the skeleton. His legs became brittle and splintered, dropping him to the ground. Rust consumed the pitted sword. The skeleton writhed in confusion, caught in the grip of entropy. His bones thinned, his back arched as if in some silent howl, and he fell to dust. I slipped back into unconsciousness. [PARAGRAPH:3] I dreamed of the past few weeks. Of my days in Cevedes preparing for this trial. Most suspect a mage spends this time in deep study, perusing ancient tomes or practicing spells. But the days before a trial are too late for the intense study sorcery requires. Instead we spend them in simple comfort, without casting, building our strength. I spent my days at Epona's Rest, the well appointed inn closest to the Cave of Ancestors and a frequent home to mages preparing for the trial. There are only a few mages per year that take the trial, no circle requires it, and each is a treated as a hero. Citizens visited the inn to wish me well, Stonewardens, Foxmen and Saperes come to offer blessings and advice. Drinks were bought for me and songs played in my honor. My nights were spent in my room, which overlooked both the entrance to the Cave and the obsidian archway that was the exit for those that survived it. Garath Per'un, a talented bard with boyish blond curls and a crocked smile, shared my room and we spend many nights entwined upon my bed. If I could not have the thrill of magic, than the throes of passion would suffice, and Garath brought them easily. We opened the windows and lay naked and breathless, allowing the warm summer night air to cover us with the sounds and smells of the city. The wind woke me. But unlike my dreams, this air was heavy with the odor of ruin and decay. The rune's curse had worn off and though I was sore, I could raise my arms and legs again. My staff still glowed, though it was faint, I had used much of its energy destroying the skeleton. In its pale blue light I could see that the ground was stained with blood. Others had fallen here, but there were no bodies. Another rune provided the answer to the missing bodies, a necromantic mark on the ceiling. I was unfamiliar with the symbols, but I suspect they raise any killed in this room as a skeleton. I didn't need to look at the rune on the door to know that it was a pull of the earth rune, a common trap I had been a fool to fall for. The cave continued on. Gradually sloping down as it had since I entered. I had passed through a few rooms like that of the skeletons, but I could only see rough tunnel ahead. I swore, startled, when I noticed the pale shimmer of a young boy standing in one of the tunnels shadowed recesses. The alcove had been empty when I examined it seconds before. He was a ghost, like a form lit only by a candle surrounded by a world in daylight. He wasn't threatening or sad, he simply watched me. His eyes were wide, his hands nervously straightened the folds of his loose white nightshirt that faded to nothingness at the edges. "Who are you?" I asked, lowering the tip of the staff toward him both to guard against any sudden movement and to drive the shadows out of the recess. He appeared to be alone. "A boy. " he said. His voice was thin and distant, like the wind through trees. "Are you here to attack me?" I said. He held his hands up. His lips quivered and his eyes grew wider. I felt guilty for scaring him, but I had to assume that everything in the cave was a threat. "No, I am with you. I'm just a boy. " he said. "You are a ghost. Did you die in this cave?" [PARAGRAPH:3]3 "I don't know. I don't think so. " he said. His eyes welled up with tears. I lowered my staff. Was I going to fall into another trap? But I didn't want him to cry. He was, at most, six years old. Thin, but healthy for a floating spirit. "I gave you back your staff. I didn't want the clicking man to get you. " he said. I looked at where my staff had been lying and remembered the feeling of the warm wood sliding into the palm of my hand. "Thank you, I think you saved me. " He smiled, his hands stopped wringing his shirt. "Are you here to help mages taking the trial?" I asked. He shrugged. "Have you ever helped anyone else?" I asked. "I don't think so. I don't remember anyone else. " he said. I watched him while I walked down the tunnel. He floated behind me, seemingly content. "What's your name?" I asked. He shrugged again. Noticing my skeptical look he added, "I don't know. " "I need something to call you. " He didn't suggest anything. "How about Willim?" I asked. He smiled again, but said nothing. The tunnel opened to a larger chamber. The rough stone floor gave way to green lichen so thick it almost appeared to be a layer of grass. There was a pool at the center of the chamber, the water was a deep blue and perfectly still. The tunnel continued on the far side of the chamber and the chambers ceiling was lost in darkness. For the first time I noticed how thirsty I was, and though I wasn't fool enough to drink from the pool, I was tempted. My first step on the slick lichen caused me stumble, but I caught myself and continued carefully across it. "Do you know anything about this room?" I asked. Willim looked around, studying the ground, the pool and the darkness above. "The pool is dangerous, many people have died in it. No one has died in the rest of the room. " Great, I'm traveling with a six year old necromancer. As I neared the pool a chirping echoed through the chamber. It was like a high pitched bullfrog. Soon hundreds more echoed back. It was impossible to tell which direction the sound was coming from. I hurried across the chamber, as quickly as I could without falling. Then came the sound of insect wings, an angry buzzing that reverberated through the chamber, and a fat swarm dropped out of the darkness above me. Each of the bugs was nearly the size of a chicken's egg, with a smooth black and yellow carapace, sharp mandibles curved like a Malakim scimitar and six hooked claws. [PARAGRAPH:3] The buzzing was maddening, and they flew into my hair where I could feel them crawling and searching for flesh. Others landed on my face and arms where they bit through my robes and into my back, chest and legs. I couldn't see beyond the swarming mass of black and yellow. I slipped again, coming down hard at the pools edge. I waved the bugs away from my face but dozens of stings on my arms and body made them feel like I was on fire. I cried out as one found the back of my neck. I was tempted again by the pool, the promised relief from the bugs and the burning. I slid but stopped myself at the pools edge. I held myself there, staring into the depths where the green lichen disappeared into the blue. Barely visible within the pools depths I could see two milky eyes looking up at me, waiting. Taking a breath I scrambled up along the side of the pool. I swung my staff as much to hit the swarm as to shake off those biting my arms. The far tunnel blurred as tears from pain, frustration and panic filled my eyes. I had so little energy left, but I ignored the bites, ignored the buzzing, ignored the kaleidoscope of yellow and black around me and focused as far into the tunnel as I could see. In that instant the bugs covered me like a blanket of swarming carapaces and thin wings, and I teleported into the tunnel. The bugs collapsed to the floor, for a confused minute the buzzing faded. A bug dropped and fell into the pool. It was quickly pulled beneath by a hooked tendril. I ran down the tunnel away from the chamber. I was bleeding from dozens of bites on my arms, neck and face. The swarm gave chase, its buzzing was even louder in the smaller tunnel. The slick floor gave way to smooth, dry stone, the humidity to a dry warmth. I could see the red glow of a furnace ahead. Willim floated after me, the bugs passed harmlessly through him. He looked behind us, eyes wide at the approaching swarm and equally afraid of the wall of fire that blocked our path. I looked again through the entropic eye. The fire was weak, a thin wall easily put out by a basic water spell. But this was one trap I needed. "Is it safe on the other side?" I panted. Willim rushed ahead, a pale blur up into the fire. He came quickly back. "Yes. " he said. It was all I had time to hear, I jumped through the fire. Through the flash of heat there was a damp, choking darkness. At first I thought it was a sewer, it was the only thing I could imagine that would smell this bad and my legs sunk nearly to my waist in thick sludge. But there was writhing within the sludge, something licked my ankle. I knew of them from my studies, Lemures. The wall of flame still burned behind me, and I backed up to it in disgust. Lemures are the least of demons, those souls with so little conviction that they spent eternity in pools of their own excrement, releasing and consuming their own waste until they become soft, bloated bags of demonic flesh. [PARAGRAPH:3] A ripple broke the sludge's thick skin, something moved underneath. Willim walked through the fire behind me. "There is a horrible creature ahead. A demon of sadness and misery. " he said. There was a tunnel entrance on the opposite side of the bowl shaped room. Black, greasy walls sloped down into the sludge as if carved out by an underground river. "Is there anything in the sludge except for the Lemures?" I asked. Willim looked confused. "The demons in the sludge, they are lethargy spirits, unable to act. Is there anything more dangerous in the sludge?" "These are the souls of those that have given up. Mages to tired or afraid to continue. But no, there is nothing here except for them. " he said. I started through the pool. I stepped on something thick and eely, it recoiled from my touch and set off a series of ripples and wet shrieks that echoed around the small room. I continued across, staff held above the surface. Though I was willing to risk my legs to the creatures touch, I wouldn't risk the staff. "What are the symbols on your hands?" William asked. A large mass moved in the sludge and I stopped, waiting to see if it was a single large body moving toward me or several smaller Lemures jostling for position. In front of me the sludge was just watery enough that I could see a withered human arm curled up against a bloated form below the surface. "They are tattoos. " I said working around the body floating in front of me. "The one of my left is the starry eye, the symbol for dimensional magic. On my left I have the immundus, the symbol for entropic magic. " The conversation helped me ignore my disgusting task. Willim simply floated above the sludge, as calm here as he was in the skeletons chamber. "How did you learn about the spirits in these rooms?" I asked. "The fire and bugs aren't very real to me. They look like shadows. Other things are more real. The screams of those that died in the pool, the spirits of those trapped here. " Willim trailed off, staring into the sludge. I called for him to begin following me again. "But you can touch some things. " I said. "You gave me my staff. " "Yes, the shadows are real, they are just very. . . " his brow furrowed as he searched for the right word. "Faint?" I offered. He nodded. The floor began rising as I got close to the edge of the pool. I was glad to be out of it, though the bottom half of my carnelian robes were now stained brown. Fetid orange masses thick with purple veins [PARAGRAPH:3] clung to me, and I scraped them off with my staff. I was thankful my stomach was empty as I suppressed the urge to vomit. I almost preferred the comfort of the pool chamber and the biting swarm. For the first time the rough stone floor of the cave was replaced by terra cotta tiles. They were cracked and ancient near the edge of the sludge, with numerous gaps. As I walked the condition improved until they were uniform and undamaged. The walls gradually became more even, and I wondered if the trial was over. Willim grew more apprehensive as we walked and was wringing his hands in his nightshirt again. The tunnel opened into a ballroom decorated with mosaics so faded it was impossible to tell what they had once been. A elegant windowed double door was on the opposite wall. A balcony was barely visible through the doors thick and rippled glass panes. From the ballroom four smaller archways opened up to comfortable rooms. A bedroom, a study, a small sitting room and a dining room. I crossed to the windowed doorway and after checking to make sure there were no runes or obvious signs of a trap I turned the handle, it was locked. "Can you look on the other side?" I asked. Willim nodded, then stopped confused as his ghostly hand was blocked by the door. "I can't. " Willim said, his thin voice was higher than usual. I concentrated on the lock. Adepts assume that the dimension sphere was all about teleportation, as that was its most useful feat. But it is the magic of the between, of relationships, and of binding. Through the starry eye, as my mentor Boann referred to this minor feat, I could see the relationships between objects. Staring at the lock I saw a vision, a brass key with a long crenelated blade and odd triangular teeth. "We need a key. " I said. I considered teleporting to the other side of the door. I could see enough of the balcony to appear there, but I didn't want to leave Willim behind. I was also worried that a spell that powerful would leave me empty and defenseless to whatever awaited me in the far room. "Can you pass through the wall beside the door?" I asked. He ran his hands along the faded mosaics beside the door. "No. " The same was true when he tried to pass through the floor. "Let's search the side rooms for the key. " I said. As I turned back I noticed the wet trail I had left across the ball room. My robes were still soiled by the sludge, and beneath my legs were a greasy brown. A few bugs had bitten shallow wounds on my legs, and they were already inflamed and oozing a thick white puss. "Has anyone died in here?" I asked. "I don't think so, but this is a very sad place. " William said. I walked toward the bedroom, then peeked inside. It was well appointed but empty. Like the ballroom it had once been elegant. A layer of dust covered the white and green bedspread, and a dresser had a sheet over its tall mirror as if it was in storage. A women's hairbrush sat on the otherwise bare dresser. [PARAGRAPH:3] The next archway opened to a small sitting room. A pair of frayed, but comfortable looking chairs sat facing a matching sofa. In the blue light of my staff I could see a figure sleeping on the sofa. I slipped into the room, careful to keep a chair between myself and the figure. As I got closer I could hear his horse breaths. He wore an open blue jacket with tarnished gold buttons. Beneath his jacket a once white shirt was now yellowed. His considerable jowls hung over a thick neck and his graying hair was pulled back in a simple knot. His reminded me of a goat, except that a goat would be more threatening. His skin was loose and flaccid, his skinny legs supported a round pear shaped body. He wasn't a fit man grown lax in his later years, but a man that had never been fit. And on a chain around his neck hung a brass key with a crenelated blade and odd triangular teeth. I closed my eyes and focused. When I opened them I could see through the entropic eye. Despite his pathetic appearance there was little weakness in sleeping demon, for now I knew he was no man. Haligfyr, the holy fire that once lit the temples of Bhall, would destroy him. Powerful spells of sanctuary or binding could restrain him. But there was nothing I could do except run from him. He snorted, nearly choking on his own tongue, then rolled clumsily onto his side and began coughing. Willim fled the room, peeking back nervously into the archway, keeping me in sight but hiding from the coughing demon. With a face red from the force of his coughs the demon finally noticed me. He went quiet, looking nervously around to see if there was anyone else in the small sitting room. "Do you have anything to drink?" he asked as he buttoned up his blue coat. The buttons strained against his wide stomach. "No. " I said. "Then why are you sneaking about my sitting room?" He tried to straighten his hair but only managed to mess it up further. He gave up in frustration. "I'm traveling through this cave. I need to get through the windowed door. " It seemed wrong to be honest with him, but I couldn't think of a lie that would help. "Oh. " he said. He considered as if trying to remember something, then looked up suddenly. "Do you want the key?" "Yes. " I said. He took the chain off and held it out to me. He stood there, arm out toward me, hand up with the brass key and coils of the chain sitting in the palm of his hand. He yawned as he waited for me to take it. "It can't be that easy. You're simply going to give me the key?" I asked. "I'm probably supposed to stop you. Transform into some giant tusked worm and then fight to the death. But I simply haven't got it in me. " "You're afraid?" I said. He smiled. "No. Your spell staff is dim, you might have enough energy for one more spell. And I assume it wasn't like this when you entered the trial. So you have used it. You wouldn't have done that if you have any energy left yourself. You are nearly dead. I could fight you, I could kill you. But why? I would rather return to my nap. " [PARAGRAPH:3]8 Tired of holding out his arm the demon walked out into the ballroom. I followed, my staff between us. He walked to the windowed door and put the key into the keyhole. "Who are you?" I asked. He considered before answering, "Accidia. " Then he stepped away from the door, leaving the key unturned in the lock. "Who are you?" he asked. Again I couldn't think of a reason to lie, "Tya Kiri, student of Litha temple. " I stepped toward the door, Accidia yawned again. Just before I touched the key Accidia added, "You are going to die in the next room. It is the worst of the challenges and those few that survive it go in ready and uninjured. " "I can't go back. Once the trial is started the only way out is at the other end. " "True, true. " Accidia said. "But why go on at all? You could sleep here. I have a bedroom, you wouldn't hunger or feel pain. Your boy could stay with you. If you go on further he will die with you. You are so very weak. " I hadn't seen Willim since I came out of the sitting room. "Willim will remain with or without me. " I said. I turned the key and opened the door, quick to find a point to teleport to if Accidia attacked. But he simply stood and watched me. The balcony was made of the same faded brown stone of the ballroom. A mosaic covered the floor, that of a great black crow with wings unfurled. Beyond the balcony there was only darkness. I stepped out onto the balcony and Accidia followed. "The key, please. " he asked. I handed it back to him then walked to the edge of the balcony. There was a chaotic wind in the emptiness, fierce then suddenly calm in no predictable order, as if angry spirits were trapped in the air. Far below the balcony was a distant maze. Most of it was shrouded in the same darkness as the ceiling and walls of this great chamber, if they existed at all, but creatures wandered through the maze, tormented spirits burning with a purple fire. Some were slow, a creature with a hundred arms dragging itself along. Others moved with purpose, a floating eye burning everything before it, a horned figure leading a pack of demonic hounds. If there was an exit to the maze it was lost in the darkness. "That is the trials last, and most difficult challenge. " Accidia said. "Those demons hunt endlessly for the few mortals willing to enter their lair. " I looked back into the ballroom, there was no sign of Willim. The balcony door was still open, so I hoped that Willim had slipped out, even if I couldn't see him. "Is there a way down?" I asked. "The most promising use magic. " Accidia said, a thin smile momentarily breaking his otherwise impassive face. "A simple task for air, earth or creation mages. A bit more difficult for body or force mages. " [PARAGRAPH:3] A costly spell for dimension mages though. If there was enough energy in my staff I could teleport to any area of the maze I could see. Unfortunately those were only the places that had demons roaming in them. I could throw my staff into the maze and, if it didn't break, it would light up an area. But without my staff I wouldn't be able to teleport to it. "Come rest, dream eternal and you will never know the touch of death. " Accidia said. There was the white glow of candlelight within the maze. Unlike the fiery purple of the demons this figure was small and pale. There were no demons around him and he waved his arms at me. It was Willim. How odd that in this moment, as I stood on the balcony with the demon Accidia, looking down into the infernal maze that I was likely to die in, that I would feel joy. And at the sight of a ghost. But I forced myself to be skeptical. This could be another trap. I looked through the starry eye and examined Willim, what was it that bound him to me? What was our relationship? Then I leaped from the balcony. Accidia returned to the ballroom, locking the door behind him. Maybe he would try harder to stop the next mage that passed through. Maybe he would turn into a giant tusked worm. Even considering the thought tired him, and he shambled back to the sitting room for another nap before he committed himself to anything. I fell through darkness. Teleportation takes more energy the farther you travel. The best way to reduce its cost was to get as close to the point I wanted to teleport to on my own, so I leaped into the emptiness above the maze. I hadn't expected the winds that buffeted me about. One knocked me aside, nearly into the obsidian wall beneath the balcony, and I twisted to keep Willim in sight and my staff securely in hand. My eyes were fixed on Willim, both to provide a target for my spell and because of what my divination spell had revealed. Willim's crooked smile, as he happily waved to me, was gone, replaced by a look of horror. My stomach tightened as I considered the fractions of seconds I had left before I released the spell. Then I was gone. The wind that raged around me was lost, the ground was firmly beneath my feet. I righted myself with my spell and was no longer bound by inertia of my fall. I always did have a flair for dimensional magic. But my spellstaff was dark, the spell had used the last of its magic. "I. . . I thought you fell. " Willim said. "I'm okay. But I have no magic left. We have to escape from this maze without running into any of the demons. Do you know how to get out?" "No. " Willim said. "Then follow me. " William had been standing at a corner with identical hallways going forward and to the left into darkness. Everything was constructed of the same obsidian surface as the wall beneath the balcony. The obsidian was scarred and rough at some points and perfectly smooth at others. These smooth patches acted as black mirrors and reflected corrupted versions of anything before it, or endless inky blackness. As I walked by one I saw myself withered and alone, wearing a drab grey cloak. [PARAGRAPH:3] I walked ahead, assuming the mazes exit would either be in the middle or on the opposite side from the balcony. Both would be in front of me. We walked for hours, the hallway slowly curved and I ignored archways to the right and left. I began to wonder if I had been walking around the maze in circles. I stopped and looked around, but any light coming through the windowed balcony door was blocked by the balcony. There was no indication of direction or distance. Tired of walking straight I turned right at the next intersection. This opened immediately to another passage going right and left or I could continue straight. There was a set of obsidian stairs in the middle of the intersection leading up to just over my head. They didn't lead to anything but empty air. Down the right hallway a purple fire flared against the wall. Its source was out of sight, though it was coming closer. My eyes were adjusted to Willim's pale light but it only revealed a few meters. Now this entire area was cast in reflections of purple and black. Willim and I huddled behind the staircase, afraid to run to either hallway for fear the creature was come around the corner and see us. I could hear the flames and I prayed that whatever was coming would turn and go the other way down the hallway. The purple light faded briefly then went blindingly bright. The roaring flames grew even louder, and in the polished obsidian surface of the far wall I could see the reflection of a great eye spitting wild torrents of purple flame. Waves of purple flame surrounded us as the demon got closer, setting the ground on fire except for a small patch in the staircases shadow. It was so bright I couldn't see the maze walls. Noxious black smoke choked me, and I struggled not to cough. Willim was quivering next to me. I had only the dead spellstaff in my hand. The demon floated up above the staircase and the flames began to slip away as the demon peered down the tunnel before it. Then the demon slipped over the edge of the staircase into the air above us and I could see the cracked fissures that covered the bottom of the giant eye. I held my breath as it passed over us and floated down the hallway. I sat and watched the demon silhouetted by its purple light, urging myself to get up, to run. Finally my stubborn legs obeyed and I ran down the hallway the demon had come from. Willim ran after me. I turned the corner the demon had come from. I had hoped to see an opening to sunlight or elegant double doors, but it was another hallway leading into darkness. I needed to give my eyes time to adjust to Willim's faint light so I slowed to a walk with one hand against the left wall. We walked for a few minutes in silence until I finally spoke. "I checked the relationship between us. " I said, nearly as nervous as I had been when the demon passed over us. "I brought you into the cave with me, you aren't supposed to be here. " Willim didn't answer. He walked beside me with his hands at his side. He looked older then when I had first met him in the skeleton's chamber, perhaps as old as eight. He was just beginning to trade his face's baby fat for the angular curves of boyhood. "I'm pregnant. " I continued. "You will be. . . or you are my son. " He smiled, glancing at me as I struggled to keep my face impassive. "Yes. " he said, "I am with you. " [PARAGRAPH:3] "I wouldn't have entered the trial if I had known. " I said. We walked for hours through the maze. Willim asked about my home and I told him stories of Litha temple, the rosering, the cliffs and beaches of Arune. I told him about my instructor Boann and the bard Garath Per'un, Willim's father. Without any stories of his own Willim was eager to hear all of mine and laughed and asked questions as I told them. We were so absorbed in talking that we nearly ran into the obsidian wall at yet another dead end. We turned and walked back to the last intersection. We both stopped when we heard the plodding footfalls of something huge. I huddled against the wall and signaled for Willim to hide beside me. The thumps stopped and we heard a great intake of breath, like the air being drawn into a massive bellows, followed by an exhale and then a return to silence. There was one step, more noticeable by the vibration in the floor than for its sound, and a giant head loomed into view. The head was dominated by its mouth, which was easily large enough to swallow a barrel whole. A flat nose sat atop it and small black eyes that looked comically undersized compared to the rest of the heads. What was most alarming was the placement of the head, the creature was over twice my height. My brief hope that the head floated on its own, or was attached to some frail thin body were quickly crushed. The giant, which I recognized as a Caducus, stepped into our hallway. His fat naked torso was a cage of flesh, built to contain anyone he swallowed. He would hold them trapped and helpless within his empty torso until he traveled back to hell, where he would barter with the flesh merchants of Dis, the warlords of the Bellobellum, or offer them to Camulos in tribute. He smiled when he saw me. "Run!" I shouted, and I was up and charging toward the Caducus. The only way out of this hallway was by him and I ran toward his left side, switching to his right side at the last moment in the hope that he would be unable to turn in time. He was faster than I expected and his reach made it nearly impossible to stay away from his thick hands. He reached for me and I struck his fingers with my spellstaff. The Caducus roared in pain and gave up his grab for a punch. The blow struck me in the chest and sent me into the hallway wall. Hitting the wall hurt almost as much as the punch and I fell on the ground dizzy from pain. "Run!" This time it was Willim screaming. My vision cleared as I took in the scene before me. The Caducus was holding Willim over his mouth, as I screamed he pushed Willim nearly halfway down his throat and swallowed. I felt a chill go through my body as Willim fell into the Caducus's wide stomach. I charged the Caducus with my spellstaff ready for another strike. But the Caducus was too fast and it caught my waist in one giant hand. It slammed me into a wall, hoping to quiet me long enough to swallow. The blow stunned me, but I regained my focus as he lifted me over his head and I swung my staff, striking the giant's ear. [PARAGRAPH:3] The Caducus roared and his grip loosened enough that I slipped out of his hand and onto his wide shoulders. The Caducus ripped the staff easily from my hands, and I fell against his wide head where one tiny black eye glared at me. The Caducus stumbled back against the maze wall as he tried to grab me. Standing on the creatures shoulder I could see the top of the wall and I leaped for it. The sharp edge of the obsidian wall cut across my stomach and I pulled myself up and rolled onto the top of the wall in blinding pain. But there was no time to rest, the Caducus's giant hands came over the top of the wall and he began to pull himself up after me. I looked for anything to use as a weapon, there was nothing. The darkness of the maze was broken by a small sliver of light in a grove two hallways over. A obsidian archway stood alone, but through it I could see the city of Cevedes. I knew the other side of that portal, it sat above the entrance to the Cave of Ancestors, it was the exit for the trial. The Caducus pulled himself up on the maze wall. Through the gaping holes on his torso I could see Willim, who was still too large to pass through them. Willim was yelling for me, but I couldn't hear what he was saying. A spasm of pain flashed through me, like a hand had reached into my intestines and squeezed. I stumbled toward the Caducus, unwilling to leave Willim, but unable to do anything to stop the giant. My decisions didn't matter as the Caducus was on me. He grabbed my leg and pulled me against him. I kicked helplessly. Held up against his body I reached through one of the gaping holes in his torso. I could see Willim, and feel him as he placed his hands in mine. "You can see the way out. " he said. His hands were so tiny in mine, he seemed to be growing younger. "Yes," I cried "but I can't get there. " "Use magic. " he said. A lucky kick cracked the Caducus's knee. He grabbed my throat with his other hand and squeezed. I looked for Willim through a haze of pain. "The spellstaff is your life. " Willim said, his words growing distant. "Just as I am, use me to cast your spell. " Tears blurred my vision, Willim let go of my hand I lost sight of him as the Caducus shook me again. Satisfied that I was no longer struggling the Caducus held me up to his mouth. I looked around and saw the distant portal light. I searched myself for the life inside me and found it faint and weak. Just as the Caducus stuffed me into his mouth I focused and disappeared. I could hear the Caducus scream as I stumbled through the portal and out onto the ridge overlooking Cevedes. I collapsed there my trial completed, and cried as I felt the life inside me grow cold and still. </English>
		<French>[PARAGRAPH] I was lost in darkness, numb to the touch of the rough stone floor I was pressed against. The final skeleton drew closer but his rattling bones dimmed in my ears. All that remained was the burning pain of my body pushed past its limits. I struggled to breathe, but the curse held me tight against the ground. I willed myself alive. Demanded that my hollow body move. My hands scraped across the floor for my staff, and I realized again that it was too far away. There was a time before I was born when I was not alive, would it be the same after my death? Was life only a short breath between twin eternities? There was no magic left in me, my mastery of entropy and dimensions was lost, a brilliant book with the last page turned. My energy had been spent defeating the golem, the blinding aurealis, and the rest of the skeletons. Powerful spells of unmaking and the between. Now I have only enough energy for adepts tricks, to sense the world through the dominions I had mastered. Dark winds whispered to me. Told me of the skeleton's weaknesses, showed me his brittle bones, his clumsy gait and the predictable swing of his pitted sword. He was a collection of vulnerabilities, but he would still kill me. If only I had my spellstaff. I spent months binding my spirit to it, investing my energy in the smooth wood so that in times like these I could draw it out. I could see it laying discarded on the floor, its dim blue glow lighting the chamber. I tried to reach it, but my body refused to move. I had rushed through the door to escape the skeleton, missed the rune, and now it bound me to the ground as if chains weighed at each part of me. Darkness returned and I was grateful I wouldn't bear timid, struggling witness to my own murder. I dreamed I was again a girl running among the flowers of Litha temple. I could feel the grass under my bare feet and smell the wild mix of flowers that bloomed in the eternal summer of the garden. The touch of smooth mahogany drew me back, the touch of my staff cupped inside my hand. The skeleton was so close his wobbling knees were all I could see, his sword was raised to strike. Though my body ignored my demands my will responded and I drew upon the staff's power. As a thing alive it reached out of me and swallowed the skeleton. His legs became brittle and splintered, dropping him to the ground. Rust consumed the pitted sword. The skeleton writhed in confusion, caught in the grip of entropy. His bones thinned, his back arched as if in some silent howl, and he fell to dust. I slipped back into unconsciousness. [PARAGRAPH:3] I dreamed of the past few weeks. Of my days in Cevedes preparing for this trial. Most suspect a mage spends this time in deep study, perusing ancient tomes or practicing spells. But the days before a trial are too late for the intense study sorcery requires. Instead we spend them in simple comfort, without casting, building our strength. I spent my days at Epona's Rest, the well appointed inn closest to the Cave of Ancestors and a frequent home to mages preparing for the trial. There are only a few mages per year that take the trial, no circle requires it, and each is a treated as a hero. Citizens visited the inn to wish me well, Stonewardens, Foxmen and Saperes come to offer blessings and advice. Drinks were bought for me and songs played in my honor. My nights were spent in my room, which overlooked both the entrance to the Cave and the obsidian archway that was the exit for those that survived it. Garath Per'un, a talented bard with boyish blond curls and a crocked smile, shared my room and we spend many nights entwined upon my bed. If I could not have the thrill of magic, than the throes of passion would suffice, and Garath brought them easily. We opened the windows and lay naked and breathless, allowing the warm summer night air to cover us with the sounds and smells of the city. The wind woke me. But unlike my dreams, this air was heavy with the odor of ruin and decay. The rune's curse had worn off and though I was sore, I could raise my arms and legs again. My staff still glowed, though it was faint, I had used much of its energy destroying the skeleton. In its pale blue light I could see that the ground was stained with blood. Others had fallen here, but there were no bodies. Another rune provided the answer to the missing bodies, a necromantic mark on the ceiling. I was unfamiliar with the symbols, but I suspect they raise any killed in this room as a skeleton. I didn't need to look at the rune on the door to know that it was a pull of the earth rune, a common trap I had been a fool to fall for. The cave continued on. Gradually sloping down as it had since I entered. I had passed through a few rooms like that of the skeletons, but I could only see rough tunnel ahead. I swore, startled, when I noticed the pale shimmer of a young boy standing in one of the tunnels shadowed recesses. The alcove had been empty when I examined it seconds before. He was a ghost, like a form lit only by a candle surrounded by a world in daylight. He wasn't threatening or sad, he simply watched me. His eyes were wide, his hands nervously straightened the folds of his loose white nightshirt that faded to nothingness at the edges. "Who are you?" I asked, lowering the tip of the staff toward him both to guard against any sudden movement and to drive the shadows out of the recess. He appeared to be alone. "A boy. " he said. His voice was thin and distant, like the wind through trees. "Are you here to attack me?" I said. He held his hands up. His lips quivered and his eyes grew wider. I felt guilty for scaring him, but I had to assume that everything in the cave was a threat. "No, I am with you. I'm just a boy. " he said. "You are a ghost. Did you die in this cave?" [PARAGRAPH:3]3 "I don't know. I don't think so. " he said. His eyes welled up with tears. I lowered my staff. Was I going to fall into another trap? But I didn't want him to cry. He was, at most, six years old. Thin, but healthy for a floating spirit. "I gave you back your staff. I didn't want the clicking man to get you. " he said. I looked at where my staff had been lying and remembered the feeling of the warm wood sliding into the palm of my hand. "Thank you, I think you saved me. " He smiled, his hands stopped wringing his shirt. "Are you here to help mages taking the trial?" I asked. He shrugged. "Have you ever helped anyone else?" I asked. "I don't think so. I don't remember anyone else. " he said. I watched him while I walked down the tunnel. He floated behind me, seemingly content. "What's your name?" I asked. He shrugged again. Noticing my skeptical look he added, "I don't know. " "I need something to call you. " He didn't suggest anything. "How about Willim?" I asked. He smiled again, but said nothing. The tunnel opened to a larger chamber. The rough stone floor gave way to green lichen so thick it almost appeared to be a layer of grass. There was a pool at the center of the chamber, the water was a deep blue and perfectly still. The tunnel continued on the far side of the chamber and the chambers ceiling was lost in darkness. For the first time I noticed how thirsty I was, and though I wasn't fool enough to drink from the pool, I was tempted. My first step on the slick lichen caused me stumble, but I caught myself and continued carefully across it. "Do you know anything about this room?" I asked. Willim looked around, studying the ground, the pool and the darkness above. "The pool is dangerous, many people have died in it. No one has died in the rest of the room. " Great, I'm traveling with a six year old necromancer. As I neared the pool a chirping echoed through the chamber. It was like a high pitched bullfrog. Soon hundreds more echoed back. It was impossible to tell which direction the sound was coming from. I hurried across the chamber, as quickly as I could without falling. Then came the sound of insect wings, an angry buzzing that reverberated through the chamber, and a fat swarm dropped out of the darkness above me. Each of the bugs was nearly the size of a chicken's egg, with a smooth black and yellow carapace, sharp mandibles curved like a Malakim scimitar and six hooked claws. [PARAGRAPH:3] The buzzing was maddening, and they flew into my hair where I could feel them crawling and searching for flesh. Others landed on my face and arms where they bit through my robes and into my back, chest and legs. I couldn't see beyond the swarming mass of black and yellow. I slipped again, coming down hard at the pools edge. I waved the bugs away from my face but dozens of stings on my arms and body made them feel like I was on fire. I cried out as one found the back of my neck. I was tempted again by the pool, the promised relief from the bugs and the burning. I slid but stopped myself at the pools edge. I held myself there, staring into the depths where the green lichen disappeared into the blue. Barely visible within the pools depths I could see two milky eyes looking up at me, waiting. Taking a breath I scrambled up along the side of the pool. I swung my staff as much to hit the swarm as to shake off those biting my arms. The far tunnel blurred as tears from pain, frustration and panic filled my eyes. I had so little energy left, but I ignored the bites, ignored the buzzing, ignored the kaleidoscope of yellow and black around me and focused as far into the tunnel as I could see. In that instant the bugs covered me like a blanket of swarming carapaces and thin wings, and I teleported into the tunnel. The bugs collapsed to the floor, for a confused minute the buzzing faded. A bug dropped and fell into the pool. It was quickly pulled beneath by a hooked tendril. I ran down the tunnel away from the chamber. I was bleeding from dozens of bites on my arms, neck and face. The swarm gave chase, its buzzing was even louder in the smaller tunnel. The slick floor gave way to smooth, dry stone, the humidity to a dry warmth. I could see the red glow of a furnace ahead. Willim floated after me, the bugs passed harmlessly through him. He looked behind us, eyes wide at the approaching swarm and equally afraid of the wall of fire that blocked our path. I looked again through the entropic eye. The fire was weak, a thin wall easily put out by a basic water spell. But this was one trap I needed. "Is it safe on the other side?" I panted. Willim rushed ahead, a pale blur up into the fire. He came quickly back. "Yes. " he said. It was all I had time to hear, I jumped through the fire. Through the flash of heat there was a damp, choking darkness. At first I thought it was a sewer, it was the only thing I could imagine that would smell this bad and my legs sunk nearly to my waist in thick sludge. But there was writhing within the sludge, something licked my ankle. I knew of them from my studies, Lemures. The wall of flame still burned behind me, and I backed up to it in disgust. Lemures are the least of demons, those souls with so little conviction that they spent eternity in pools of their own excrement, releasing and consuming their own waste until they become soft, bloated bags of demonic flesh. [PARAGRAPH:3] A ripple broke the sludge's thick skin, something moved underneath. Willim walked through the fire behind me. "There is a horrible creature ahead. A demon of sadness and misery. " he said. There was a tunnel entrance on the opposite side of the bowl shaped room. Black, greasy walls sloped down into the sludge as if carved out by an underground river. "Is there anything in the sludge except for the Lemures?" I asked. Willim looked confused. "The demons in the sludge, they are lethargy spirits, unable to act. Is there anything more dangerous in the sludge?" "These are the souls of those that have given up. Mages to tired or afraid to continue. But no, there is nothing here except for them. " he said. I started through the pool. I stepped on something thick and eely, it recoiled from my touch and set off a series of ripples and wet shrieks that echoed around the small room. I continued across, staff held above the surface. Though I was willing to risk my legs to the creatures touch, I wouldn't risk the staff. "What are the symbols on your hands?" William asked. A large mass moved in the sludge and I stopped, waiting to see if it was a single large body moving toward me or several smaller Lemures jostling for position. In front of me the sludge was just watery enough that I could see a withered human arm curled up against a bloated form below the surface. "They are tattoos. " I said working around the body floating in front of me. "The one of my left is the starry eye, the symbol for dimensional magic. On my left I have the immundus, the symbol for entropic magic. " The conversation helped me ignore my disgusting task. Willim simply floated above the sludge, as calm here as he was in the skeletons chamber. "How did you learn about the spirits in these rooms?" I asked. "The fire and bugs aren't very real to me. They look like shadows. Other things are more real. The screams of those that died in the pool, the spirits of those trapped here. " Willim trailed off, staring into the sludge. I called for him to begin following me again. "But you can touch some things. " I said. "You gave me my staff. " "Yes, the shadows are real, they are just very. . . " his brow furrowed as he searched for the right word. "Faint?" I offered. He nodded. The floor began rising as I got close to the edge of the pool. I was glad to be out of it, though the bottom half of my carnelian robes were now stained brown. Fetid orange masses thick with purple veins [PARAGRAPH:3] clung to me, and I scraped them off with my staff. I was thankful my stomach was empty as I suppressed the urge to vomit. I almost preferred the comfort of the pool chamber and the biting swarm. For the first time the rough stone floor of the cave was replaced by terra cotta tiles. They were cracked and ancient near the edge of the sludge, with numerous gaps. As I walked the condition improved until they were uniform and undamaged. The walls gradually became more even, and I wondered if the trial was over. Willim grew more apprehensive as we walked and was wringing his hands in his nightshirt again. The tunnel opened into a ballroom decorated with mosaics so faded it was impossible to tell what they had once been. A elegant windowed double door was on the opposite wall. A balcony was barely visible through the doors thick and rippled glass panes. From the ballroom four smaller archways opened up to comfortable rooms. A bedroom, a study, a small sitting room and a dining room. I crossed to the windowed doorway and after checking to make sure there were no runes or obvious signs of a trap I turned the handle, it was locked. "Can you look on the other side?" I asked. Willim nodded, then stopped confused as his ghostly hand was blocked by the door. "I can't. " Willim said, his thin voice was higher than usual. I concentrated on the lock. Adepts assume that the dimension sphere was all about teleportation, as that was its most useful feat. But it is the magic of the between, of relationships, and of binding. Through the starry eye, as my mentor Boann referred to this minor feat, I could see the relationships between objects. Staring at the lock I saw a vision, a brass key with a long crenelated blade and odd triangular teeth. "We need a key. " I said. I considered teleporting to the other side of the door. I could see enough of the balcony to appear there, but I didn't want to leave Willim behind. I was also worried that a spell that powerful would leave me empty and defenseless to whatever awaited me in the far room. "Can you pass through the wall beside the door?" I asked. He ran his hands along the faded mosaics beside the door. "No. " The same was true when he tried to pass through the floor. "Let's search the side rooms for the key. " I said. As I turned back I noticed the wet trail I had left across the ball room. My robes were still soiled by the sludge, and beneath my legs were a greasy brown. A few bugs had bitten shallow wounds on my legs, and they were already inflamed and oozing a thick white puss. "Has anyone died in here?" I asked. "I don't think so, but this is a very sad place. " William said. I walked toward the bedroom, then peeked inside. It was well appointed but empty. Like the ballroom it had once been elegant. A layer of dust covered the white and green bedspread, and a dresser had a sheet over its tall mirror as if it was in storage. A women's hairbrush sat on the otherwise bare dresser. [PARAGRAPH:3] The next archway opened to a small sitting room. A pair of frayed, but comfortable looking chairs sat facing a matching sofa. In the blue light of my staff I could see a figure sleeping on the sofa. I slipped into the room, careful to keep a chair between myself and the figure. As I got closer I could hear his horse breaths. He wore an open blue jacket with tarnished gold buttons. Beneath his jacket a once white shirt was now yellowed. His considerable jowls hung over a thick neck and his graying hair was pulled back in a simple knot. His reminded me of a goat, except that a goat would be more threatening. His skin was loose and flaccid, his skinny legs supported a round pear shaped body. He wasn't a fit man grown lax in his later years, but a man that had never been fit. And on a chain around his neck hung a brass key with a crenelated blade and odd triangular teeth. I closed my eyes and focused. When I opened them I could see through the entropic eye. Despite his pathetic appearance there was little weakness in sleeping demon, for now I knew he was no man. Haligfyr, the holy fire that once lit the temples of Bhall, would destroy him. Powerful spells of sanctuary or binding could restrain him. But there was nothing I could do except run from him. He snorted, nearly choking on his own tongue, then rolled clumsily onto his side and began coughing. Willim fled the room, peeking back nervously into the archway, keeping me in sight but hiding from the coughing demon. With a face red from the force of his coughs the demon finally noticed me. He went quiet, looking nervously around to see if there was anyone else in the small sitting room. "Do you have anything to drink?" he asked as he buttoned up his blue coat. The buttons strained against his wide stomach. "No. " I said. "Then why are you sneaking about my sitting room?" He tried to straighten his hair but only managed to mess it up further. He gave up in frustration. "I'm traveling through this cave. I need to get through the windowed door. " It seemed wrong to be honest with him, but I couldn't think of a lie that would help. "Oh. " he said. He considered as if trying to remember something, then looked up suddenly. "Do you want the key?" "Yes. " I said. He took the chain off and held it out to me. He stood there, arm out toward me, hand up with the brass key and coils of the chain sitting in the palm of his hand. He yawned as he waited for me to take it. "It can't be that easy. You're simply going to give me the key?" I asked. "I'm probably supposed to stop you. Transform into some giant tusked worm and then fight to the death. But I simply haven't got it in me. " "You're afraid?" I said. He smiled. "No. Your spell staff is dim, you might have enough energy for one more spell. And I assume it wasn't like this when you entered the trial. So you have used it. You wouldn't have done that if you have any energy left yourself. You are nearly dead. I could fight you, I could kill you. But why? I would rather return to my nap. " [PARAGRAPH:3]8 Tired of holding out his arm the demon walked out into the ballroom. I followed, my staff between us. He walked to the windowed door and put the key into the keyhole. "Who are you?" I asked. He considered before answering, "Accidia. " Then he stepped away from the door, leaving the key unturned in the lock. "Who are you?" he asked. Again I couldn't think of a reason to lie, "Tya Kiri, student of Litha temple. " I stepped toward the door, Accidia yawned again. Just before I touched the key Accidia added, "You are going to die in the next room. It is the worst of the challenges and those few that survive it go in ready and uninjured. " "I can't go back. Once the trial is started the only way out is at the other end. " "True, true. " Accidia said. "But why go on at all? You could sleep here. I have a bedroom, you wouldn't hunger or feel pain. Your boy could stay with you. If you go on further he will die with you. You are so very weak. " I hadn't seen Willim since I came out of the sitting room. "Willim will remain with or without me. " I said. I turned the key and opened the door, quick to find a point to teleport to if Accidia attacked. But he simply stood and watched me. The balcony was made of the same faded brown stone of the ballroom. A mosaic covered the floor, that of a great black crow with wings unfurled. Beyond the balcony there was only darkness. I stepped out onto the balcony and Accidia followed. "The key, please. " he asked. I handed it back to him then walked to the edge of the balcony. There was a chaotic wind in the emptiness, fierce then suddenly calm in no predictable order, as if angry spirits were trapped in the air. Far below the balcony was a distant maze. Most of it was shrouded in the same darkness as the ceiling and walls of this great chamber, if they existed at all, but creatures wandered through the maze, tormented spirits burning with a purple fire. Some were slow, a creature with a hundred arms dragging itself along. Others moved with purpose, a floating eye burning everything before it, a horned figure leading a pack of demonic hounds. If there was an exit to the maze it was lost in the darkness. "That is the trials last, and most difficult challenge. " Accidia said. "Those demons hunt endlessly for the few mortals willing to enter their lair. " I looked back into the ballroom, there was no sign of Willim. The balcony door was still open, so I hoped that Willim had slipped out, even if I couldn't see him. "Is there a way down?" I asked. "The most promising use magic. " Accidia said, a thin smile momentarily breaking his otherwise impassive face. "A simple task for air, earth or creation mages. A bit more difficult for body or force mages. " [PARAGRAPH:3] A costly spell for dimension mages though. If there was enough energy in my staff I could teleport to any area of the maze I could see. Unfortunately those were only the places that had demons roaming in them. I could throw my staff into the maze and, if it didn't break, it would light up an area. But without my staff I wouldn't be able to teleport to it. "Come rest, dream eternal and you will never know the touch of death. " Accidia said. There was the white glow of candlelight within the maze. Unlike the fiery purple of the demons this figure was small and pale. There were no demons around him and he waved his arms at me. It was Willim. How odd that in this moment, as I stood on the balcony with the demon Accidia, looking down into the infernal maze that I was likely to die in, that I would feel joy. And at the sight of a ghost. But I forced myself to be skeptical. This could be another trap. I looked through the starry eye and examined Willim, what was it that bound him to me? What was our relationship? Then I leaped from the balcony. Accidia returned to the ballroom, locking the door behind him. Maybe he would try harder to stop the next mage that passed through. Maybe he would turn into a giant tusked worm. Even considering the thought tired him, and he shambled back to the sitting room for another nap before he committed himself to anything. I fell through darkness. Teleportation takes more energy the farther you travel. The best way to reduce its cost was to get as close to the point I wanted to teleport to on my own, so I leaped into the emptiness above the maze. I hadn't expected the winds that buffeted me about. One knocked me aside, nearly into the obsidian wall beneath the balcony, and I twisted to keep Willim in sight and my staff securely in hand. My eyes were fixed on Willim, both to provide a target for my spell and because of what my divination spell had revealed. Willim's crooked smile, as he happily waved to me, was gone, replaced by a look of horror. My stomach tightened as I considered the fractions of seconds I had left before I released the spell. Then I was gone. The wind that raged around me was lost, the ground was firmly beneath my feet. I righted myself with my spell and was no longer bound by inertia of my fall. I always did have a flair for dimensional magic. But my spellstaff was dark, the spell had used the last of its magic. "I. . . I thought you fell. " Willim said. "I'm okay. But I have no magic left. We have to escape from this maze without running into any of the demons. Do you know how to get out?" "No. " Willim said. "Then follow me. " William had been standing at a corner with identical hallways going forward and to the left into darkness. Everything was constructed of the same obsidian surface as the wall beneath the balcony. The obsidian was scarred and rough at some points and perfectly smooth at others. These smooth patches acted as black mirrors and reflected corrupted versions of anything before it, or endless inky blackness. As I walked by one I saw myself withered and alone, wearing a drab grey cloak. [PARAGRAPH:3] I walked ahead, assuming the mazes exit would either be in the middle or on the opposite side from the balcony. Both would be in front of me. We walked for hours, the hallway slowly curved and I ignored archways to the right and left. I began to wonder if I had been walking around the maze in circles. I stopped and looked around, but any light coming through the windowed balcony door was blocked by the balcony. There was no indication of direction or distance. Tired of walking straight I turned right at the next intersection. This opened immediately to another passage going right and left or I could continue straight. There was a set of obsidian stairs in the middle of the intersection leading up to just over my head. They didn't lead to anything but empty air. Down the right hallway a purple fire flared against the wall. Its source was out of sight, though it was coming closer. My eyes were adjusted to Willim's pale light but it only revealed a few meters. Now this entire area was cast in reflections of purple and black. Willim and I huddled behind the staircase, afraid to run to either hallway for fear the creature was come around the corner and see us. I could hear the flames and I prayed that whatever was coming would turn and go the other way down the hallway. The purple light faded briefly then went blindingly bright. The roaring flames grew even louder, and in the polished obsidian surface of the far wall I could see the reflection of a great eye spitting wild torrents of purple flame. Waves of purple flame surrounded us as the demon got closer, setting the ground on fire except for a small patch in the staircases shadow. It was so bright I couldn't see the maze walls. Noxious black smoke choked me, and I struggled not to cough. Willim was quivering next to me. I had only the dead spellstaff in my hand. The demon floated up above the staircase and the flames began to slip away as the demon peered down the tunnel before it. Then the demon slipped over the edge of the staircase into the air above us and I could see the cracked fissures that covered the bottom of the giant eye. I held my breath as it passed over us and floated down the hallway. I sat and watched the demon silhouetted by its purple light, urging myself to get up, to run. Finally my stubborn legs obeyed and I ran down the hallway the demon had come from. Willim ran after me. I turned the corner the demon had come from. I had hoped to see an opening to sunlight or elegant double doors, but it was another hallway leading into darkness. I needed to give my eyes time to adjust to Willim's faint light so I slowed to a walk with one hand against the left wall. We walked for a few minutes in silence until I finally spoke. "I checked the relationship between us. " I said, nearly as nervous as I had been when the demon passed over us. "I brought you into the cave with me, you aren't supposed to be here. " Willim didn't answer. He walked beside me with his hands at his side. He looked older then when I had first met him in the skeleton's chamber, perhaps as old as eight. He was just beginning to trade his face's baby fat for the angular curves of boyhood. "I'm pregnant. " I continued. "You will be. . . or you are my son. " He smiled, glancing at me as I struggled to keep my face impassive. "Yes. " he said, "I am with you. " [PARAGRAPH:3] "I wouldn't have entered the trial if I had known. " I said. We walked for hours through the maze. Willim asked about my home and I told him stories of Litha temple, the rosering, the cliffs and beaches of Arune. I told him about my instructor Boann and the bard Garath Per'un, Willim's father. Without any stories of his own Willim was eager to hear all of mine and laughed and asked questions as I told them. We were so absorbed in talking that we nearly ran into the obsidian wall at yet another dead end. We turned and walked back to the last intersection. We both stopped when we heard the plodding footfalls of something huge. I huddled against the wall and signaled for Willim to hide beside me. The thumps stopped and we heard a great intake of breath, like the air being drawn into a massive bellows, followed by an exhale and then a return to silence. There was one step, more noticeable by the vibration in the floor than for its sound, and a giant head loomed into view. The head was dominated by its mouth, which was easily large enough to swallow a barrel whole. A flat nose sat atop it and small black eyes that looked comically undersized compared to the rest of the heads. What was most alarming was the placement of the head, the creature was over twice my height. My brief hope that the head floated on its own, or was attached to some frail thin body were quickly crushed. The giant, which I recognized as a Caducus, stepped into our hallway. His fat naked torso was a cage of flesh, built to contain anyone he swallowed. He would hold them trapped and helpless within his empty torso until he traveled back to hell, where he would barter with the flesh merchants of Dis, the warlords of the Bellobellum, or offer them to Camulos in tribute. He smiled when he saw me. "Run!" I shouted, and I was up and charging toward the Caducus. The only way out of this hallway was by him and I ran toward his left side, switching to his right side at the last moment in the hope that he would be unable to turn in time. He was faster than I expected and his reach made it nearly impossible to stay away from his thick hands. He reached for me and I struck his fingers with my spellstaff. The Caducus roared in pain and gave up his grab for a punch. The blow struck me in the chest and sent me into the hallway wall. Hitting the wall hurt almost as much as the punch and I fell on the ground dizzy from pain. "Run!" This time it was Willim screaming. My vision cleared as I took in the scene before me. The Caducus was holding Willim over his mouth, as I screamed he pushed Willim nearly halfway down his throat and swallowed. I felt a chill go through my body as Willim fell into the Caducus's wide stomach. I charged the Caducus with my spellstaff ready for another strike. But the Caducus was too fast and it caught my waist in one giant hand. It slammed me into a wall, hoping to quiet me long enough to swallow. The blow stunned me, but I regained my focus as he lifted me over his head and I swung my staff, striking the giant's ear. [PARAGRAPH:3] The Caducus roared and his grip loosened enough that I slipped out of his hand and onto his wide shoulders. The Caducus ripped the staff easily from my hands, and I fell against his wide head where one tiny black eye glared at me. The Caducus stumbled back against the maze wall as he tried to grab me. Standing on the creatures shoulder I could see the top of the wall and I leaped for it. The sharp edge of the obsidian wall cut across my stomach and I pulled myself up and rolled onto the top of the wall in blinding pain. But there was no time to rest, the Caducus's giant hands came over the top of the wall and he began to pull himself up after me. I looked for anything to use as a weapon, there was nothing. The darkness of the maze was broken by a small sliver of light in a grove two hallways over. A obsidian archway stood alone, but through it I could see the city of Cevedes. I knew the other side of that portal, it sat above the entrance to the Cave of Ancestors, it was the exit for the trial. The Caducus pulled himself up on the maze wall. Through the gaping holes on his torso I could see Willim, who was still too large to pass through them. Willim was yelling for me, but I couldn't hear what he was saying. A spasm of pain flashed through me, like a hand had reached into my intestines and squeezed. I stumbled toward the Caducus, unwilling to leave Willim, but unable to do anything to stop the giant. My decisions didn't matter as the Caducus was on me. He grabbed my leg and pulled me against him. I kicked helplessly. Held up against his body I reached through one of the gaping holes in his torso. I could see Willim, and feel him as he placed his hands in mine. "You can see the way out. " he said. His hands were so tiny in mine, he seemed to be growing younger. "Yes," I cried "but I can't get there. " "Use magic. " he said. A lucky kick cracked the Caducus's knee. He grabbed my throat with his other hand and squeezed. I looked for Willim through a haze of pain. "The spellstaff is your life. " Willim said, his words growing distant. "Just as I am, use me to cast your spell. " Tears blurred my vision, Willim let go of my hand I lost sight of him as the Caducus shook me again. Satisfied that I was no longer struggling the Caducus held me up to his mouth. I looked around and saw the distant portal light. I searched myself for the life inside me and found it faint and weak. Just as the Caducus stuffed me into his mouth I focused and disappeared. I could hear the Caducus scream as I stumbled through the portal and out onto the ridge overlooking Cevedes. I collapsed there my trial completed, and cried as I felt the life inside me grow cold and still. </French>
		<German>[PARAGRAPH] I was lost in darkness, numb to the touch of the rough stone floor I was pressed against. The final skeleton drew closer but his rattling bones dimmed in my ears. All that remained was the burning pain of my body pushed past its limits. I struggled to breathe, but the curse held me tight against the ground. I willed myself alive. Demanded that my hollow body move. My hands scraped across the floor for my staff, and I realized again that it was too far away. There was a time before I was born when I was not alive, would it be the same after my death? Was life only a short breath between twin eternities? There was no magic left in me, my mastery of entropy and dimensions was lost, a brilliant book with the last page turned. My energy had been spent defeating the golem, the blinding aurealis, and the rest of the skeletons. Powerful spells of unmaking and the between. Now I have only enough energy for adepts tricks, to sense the world through the dominions I had mastered. Dark winds whispered to me. Told me of the skeleton's weaknesses, showed me his brittle bones, his clumsy gait and the predictable swing of his pitted sword. He was a collection of vulnerabilities, but he would still kill me. If only I had my spellstaff. I spent months binding my spirit to it, investing my energy in the smooth wood so that in times like these I could draw it out. I could see it laying discarded on the floor, its dim blue glow lighting the chamber. I tried to reach it, but my body refused to move. I had rushed through the door to escape the skeleton, missed the rune, and now it bound me to the ground as if chains weighed at each part of me. Darkness returned and I was grateful I wouldn't bear timid, struggling witness to my own murder. I dreamed I was again a girl running among the flowers of Litha temple. I could feel the grass under my bare feet and smell the wild mix of flowers that bloomed in the eternal summer of the garden. The touch of smooth mahogany drew me back, the touch of my staff cupped inside my hand. The skeleton was so close his wobbling knees were all I could see, his sword was raised to strike. Though my body ignored my demands my will responded and I drew upon the staff's power. As a thing alive it reached out of me and swallowed the skeleton. His legs became brittle and splintered, dropping him to the ground. Rust consumed the pitted sword. The skeleton writhed in confusion, caught in the grip of entropy. His bones thinned, his back arched as if in some silent howl, and he fell to dust. I slipped back into unconsciousness. [PARAGRAPH:3] I dreamed of the past few weeks. Of my days in Cevedes preparing for this trial. Most suspect a mage spends this time in deep study, perusing ancient tomes or practicing spells. But the days before a trial are too late for the intense study sorcery requires. Instead we spend them in simple comfort, without casting, building our strength. I spent my days at Epona's Rest, the well appointed inn closest to the Cave of Ancestors and a frequent home to mages preparing for the trial. There are only a few mages per year that take the trial, no circle requires it, and each is a treated as a hero. Citizens visited the inn to wish me well, Stonewardens, Foxmen and Saperes come to offer blessings and advice. Drinks were bought for me and songs played in my honor. My nights were spent in my room, which overlooked both the entrance to the Cave and the obsidian archway that was the exit for those that survived it. Garath Per'un, a talented bard with boyish blond curls and a crocked smile, shared my room and we spend many nights entwined upon my bed. If I could not have the thrill of magic, than the throes of passion would suffice, and Garath brought them easily. We opened the windows and lay naked and breathless, allowing the warm summer night air to cover us with the sounds and smells of the city. The wind woke me. But unlike my dreams, this air was heavy with the odor of ruin and decay. The rune's curse had worn off and though I was sore, I could raise my arms and legs again. My staff still glowed, though it was faint, I had used much of its energy destroying the skeleton. In its pale blue light I could see that the ground was stained with blood. Others had fallen here, but there were no bodies. Another rune provided the answer to the missing bodies, a necromantic mark on the ceiling. I was unfamiliar with the symbols, but I suspect they raise any killed in this room as a skeleton. I didn't need to look at the rune on the door to know that it was a pull of the earth rune, a common trap I had been a fool to fall for. The cave continued on. Gradually sloping down as it had since I entered. I had passed through a few rooms like that of the skeletons, but I could only see rough tunnel ahead. I swore, startled, when I noticed the pale shimmer of a young boy standing in one of the tunnels shadowed recesses. The alcove had been empty when I examined it seconds before. He was a ghost, like a form lit only by a candle surrounded by a world in daylight. He wasn't threatening or sad, he simply watched me. His eyes were wide, his hands nervously straightened the folds of his loose white nightshirt that faded to nothingness at the edges. "Who are you?" I asked, lowering the tip of the staff toward him both to guard against any sudden movement and to drive the shadows out of the recess. He appeared to be alone. "A boy. " he said. His voice was thin and distant, like the wind through trees. "Are you here to attack me?" I said. He held his hands up. His lips quivered and his eyes grew wider. I felt guilty for scaring him, but I had to assume that everything in the cave was a threat. "No, I am with you. I'm just a boy. " he said. "You are a ghost. Did you die in this cave?" [PARAGRAPH:3]3 "I don't know. I don't think so. " he said. His eyes welled up with tears. I lowered my staff. Was I going to fall into another trap? But I didn't want him to cry. He was, at most, six years old. Thin, but healthy for a floating spirit. "I gave you back your staff. I didn't want the clicking man to get you. " he said. I looked at where my staff had been lying and remembered the feeling of the warm wood sliding into the palm of my hand. "Thank you, I think you saved me. " He smiled, his hands stopped wringing his shirt. "Are you here to help mages taking the trial?" I asked. He shrugged. "Have you ever helped anyone else?" I asked. "I don't think so. I don't remember anyone else. " he said. I watched him while I walked down the tunnel. He floated behind me, seemingly content. "What's your name?" I asked. He shrugged again. Noticing my skeptical look he added, "I don't know. " "I need something to call you. " He didn't suggest anything. "How about Willim?" I asked. He smiled again, but said nothing. The tunnel opened to a larger chamber. The rough stone floor gave way to green lichen so thick it almost appeared to be a layer of grass. There was a pool at the center of the chamber, the water was a deep blue and perfectly still. The tunnel continued on the far side of the chamber and the chambers ceiling was lost in darkness. For the first time I noticed how thirsty I was, and though I wasn't fool enough to drink from the pool, I was tempted. My first step on the slick lichen caused me stumble, but I caught myself and continued carefully across it. "Do you know anything about this room?" I asked. Willim looked around, studying the ground, the pool and the darkness above. "The pool is dangerous, many people have died in it. No one has died in the rest of the room. " Great, I'm traveling with a six year old necromancer. As I neared the pool a chirping echoed through the chamber. It was like a high pitched bullfrog. Soon hundreds more echoed back. It was impossible to tell which direction the sound was coming from. I hurried across the chamber, as quickly as I could without falling. Then came the sound of insect wings, an angry buzzing that reverberated through the chamber, and a fat swarm dropped out of the darkness above me. Each of the bugs was nearly the size of a chicken's egg, with a smooth black and yellow carapace, sharp mandibles curved like a Malakim scimitar and six hooked claws. [PARAGRAPH:3] The buzzing was maddening, and they flew into my hair where I could feel them crawling and searching for flesh. Others landed on my face and arms where they bit through my robes and into my back, chest and legs. I couldn't see beyond the swarming mass of black and yellow. I slipped again, coming down hard at the pools edge. I waved the bugs away from my face but dozens of stings on my arms and body made them feel like I was on fire. I cried out as one found the back of my neck. I was tempted again by the pool, the promised relief from the bugs and the burning. I slid but stopped myself at the pools edge. I held myself there, staring into the depths where the green lichen disappeared into the blue. Barely visible within the pools depths I could see two milky eyes looking up at me, waiting. Taking a breath I scrambled up along the side of the pool. I swung my staff as much to hit the swarm as to shake off those biting my arms. The far tunnel blurred as tears from pain, frustration and panic filled my eyes. I had so little energy left, but I ignored the bites, ignored the buzzing, ignored the kaleidoscope of yellow and black around me and focused as far into the tunnel as I could see. In that instant the bugs covered me like a blanket of swarming carapaces and thin wings, and I teleported into the tunnel. The bugs collapsed to the floor, for a confused minute the buzzing faded. A bug dropped and fell into the pool. It was quickly pulled beneath by a hooked tendril. I ran down the tunnel away from the chamber. I was bleeding from dozens of bites on my arms, neck and face. The swarm gave chase, its buzzing was even louder in the smaller tunnel. The slick floor gave way to smooth, dry stone, the humidity to a dry warmth. I could see the red glow of a furnace ahead. Willim floated after me, the bugs passed harmlessly through him. He looked behind us, eyes wide at the approaching swarm and equally afraid of the wall of fire that blocked our path. I looked again through the entropic eye. The fire was weak, a thin wall easily put out by a basic water spell. But this was one trap I needed. "Is it safe on the other side?" I panted. Willim rushed ahead, a pale blur up into the fire. He came quickly back. "Yes. " he said. It was all I had time to hear, I jumped through the fire. Through the flash of heat there was a damp, choking darkness. At first I thought it was a sewer, it was the only thing I could imagine that would smell this bad and my legs sunk nearly to my waist in thick sludge. But there was writhing within the sludge, something licked my ankle. I knew of them from my studies, Lemures. The wall of flame still burned behind me, and I backed up to it in disgust. Lemures are the least of demons, those souls with so little conviction that they spent eternity in pools of their own excrement, releasing and consuming their own waste until they become soft, bloated bags of demonic flesh. [PARAGRAPH:3] A ripple broke the sludge's thick skin, something moved underneath. Willim walked through the fire behind me. "There is a horrible creature ahead. A demon of sadness and misery. " he said. There was a tunnel entrance on the opposite side of the bowl shaped room. Black, greasy walls sloped down into the sludge as if carved out by an underground river. "Is there anything in the sludge except for the Lemures?" I asked. Willim looked confused. "The demons in the sludge, they are lethargy spirits, unable to act. Is there anything more dangerous in the sludge?" "These are the souls of those that have given up. Mages to tired or afraid to continue. But no, there is nothing here except for them. " he said. I started through the pool. I stepped on something thick and eely, it recoiled from my touch and set off a series of ripples and wet shrieks that echoed around the small room. I continued across, staff held above the surface. Though I was willing to risk my legs to the creatures touch, I wouldn't risk the staff. "What are the symbols on your hands?" William asked. A large mass moved in the sludge and I stopped, waiting to see if it was a single large body moving toward me or several smaller Lemures jostling for position. In front of me the sludge was just watery enough that I could see a withered human arm curled up against a bloated form below the surface. "They are tattoos. " I said working around the body floating in front of me. "The one of my left is the starry eye, the symbol for dimensional magic. On my left I have the immundus, the symbol for entropic magic. " The conversation helped me ignore my disgusting task. Willim simply floated above the sludge, as calm here as he was in the skeletons chamber. "How did you learn about the spirits in these rooms?" I asked. "The fire and bugs aren't very real to me. They look like shadows. Other things are more real. The screams of those that died in the pool, the spirits of those trapped here. " Willim trailed off, staring into the sludge. I called for him to begin following me again. "But you can touch some things. " I said. "You gave me my staff. " "Yes, the shadows are real, they are just very. . . " his brow furrowed as he searched for the right word. "Faint?" I offered. He nodded. The floor began rising as I got close to the edge of the pool. I was glad to be out of it, though the bottom half of my carnelian robes were now stained brown. Fetid orange masses thick with purple veins [PARAGRAPH:3] clung to me, and I scraped them off with my staff. I was thankful my stomach was empty as I suppressed the urge to vomit. I almost preferred the comfort of the pool chamber and the biting swarm. For the first time the rough stone floor of the cave was replaced by terra cotta tiles. They were cracked and ancient near the edge of the sludge, with numerous gaps. As I walked the condition improved until they were uniform and undamaged. The walls gradually became more even, and I wondered if the trial was over. Willim grew more apprehensive as we walked and was wringing his hands in his nightshirt again. The tunnel opened into a ballroom decorated with mosaics so faded it was impossible to tell what they had once been. A elegant windowed double door was on the opposite wall. A balcony was barely visible through the doors thick and rippled glass panes. From the ballroom four smaller archways opened up to comfortable rooms. A bedroom, a study, a small sitting room and a dining room. I crossed to the windowed doorway and after checking to make sure there were no runes or obvious signs of a trap I turned the handle, it was locked. "Can you look on the other side?" I asked. Willim nodded, then stopped confused as his ghostly hand was blocked by the door. "I can't. " Willim said, his thin voice was higher than usual. I concentrated on the lock. Adepts assume that the dimension sphere was all about teleportation, as that was its most useful feat. But it is the magic of the between, of relationships, and of binding. Through the starry eye, as my mentor Boann referred to this minor feat, I could see the relationships between objects. Staring at the lock I saw a vision, a brass key with a long crenelated blade and odd triangular teeth. "We need a key. " I said. I considered teleporting to the other side of the door. I could see enough of the balcony to appear there, but I didn't want to leave Willim behind. I was also worried that a spell that powerful would leave me empty and defenseless to whatever awaited me in the far room. "Can you pass through the wall beside the door?" I asked. He ran his hands along the faded mosaics beside the door. "No. " The same was true when he tried to pass through the floor. "Let's search the side rooms for the key. " I said. As I turned back I noticed the wet trail I had left across the ball room. My robes were still soiled by the sludge, and beneath my legs were a greasy brown. A few bugs had bitten shallow wounds on my legs, and they were already inflamed and oozing a thick white puss. "Has anyone died in here?" I asked. "I don't think so, but this is a very sad place. " William said. I walked toward the bedroom, then peeked inside. It was well appointed but empty. Like the ballroom it had once been elegant. A layer of dust covered the white and green bedspread, and a dresser had a sheet over its tall mirror as if it was in storage. A women's hairbrush sat on the otherwise bare dresser. [PARAGRAPH:3] The next archway opened to a small sitting room. A pair of frayed, but comfortable looking chairs sat facing a matching sofa. In the blue light of my staff I could see a figure sleeping on the sofa. I slipped into the room, careful to keep a chair between myself and the figure. As I got closer I could hear his horse breaths. He wore an open blue jacket with tarnished gold buttons. Beneath his jacket a once white shirt was now yellowed. His considerable jowls hung over a thick neck and his graying hair was pulled back in a simple knot. His reminded me of a goat, except that a goat would be more threatening. His skin was loose and flaccid, his skinny legs supported a round pear shaped body. He wasn't a fit man grown lax in his later years, but a man that had never been fit. And on a chain around his neck hung a brass key with a crenelated blade and odd triangular teeth. I closed my eyes and focused. When I opened them I could see through the entropic eye. Despite his pathetic appearance there was little weakness in sleeping demon, for now I knew he was no man. Haligfyr, the holy fire that once lit the temples of Bhall, would destroy him. Powerful spells of sanctuary or binding could restrain him. But there was nothing I could do except run from him. He snorted, nearly choking on his own tongue, then rolled clumsily onto his side and began coughing. Willim fled the room, peeking back nervously into the archway, keeping me in sight but hiding from the coughing demon. With a face red from the force of his coughs the demon finally noticed me. He went quiet, looking nervously around to see if there was anyone else in the small sitting room. "Do you have anything to drink?" he asked as he buttoned up his blue coat. The buttons strained against his wide stomach. "No. " I said. "Then why are you sneaking about my sitting room?" He tried to straighten his hair but only managed to mess it up further. He gave up in frustration. "I'm traveling through this cave. I need to get through the windowed door. " It seemed wrong to be honest with him, but I couldn't think of a lie that would help. "Oh. " he said. He considered as if trying to remember something, then looked up suddenly. "Do you want the key?" "Yes. " I said. He took the chain off and held it out to me. He stood there, arm out toward me, hand up with the brass key and coils of the chain sitting in the palm of his hand. He yawned as he waited for me to take it. "It can't be that easy. You're simply going to give me the key?" I asked. "I'm probably supposed to stop you. Transform into some giant tusked worm and then fight to the death. But I simply haven't got it in me. " "You're afraid?" I said. He smiled. "No. Your spell staff is dim, you might have enough energy for one more spell. And I assume it wasn't like this when you entered the trial. So you have used it. You wouldn't have done that if you have any energy left yourself. You are nearly dead. I could fight you, I could kill you. But why? I would rather return to my nap. " [PARAGRAPH:3]8 Tired of holding out his arm the demon walked out into the ballroom. I followed, my staff between us. He walked to the windowed door and put the key into the keyhole. "Who are you?" I asked. He considered before answering, "Accidia. " Then he stepped away from the door, leaving the key unturned in the lock. "Who are you?" he asked. Again I couldn't think of a reason to lie, "Tya Kiri, student of Litha temple. " I stepped toward the door, Accidia yawned again. Just before I touched the key Accidia added, "You are going to die in the next room. It is the worst of the challenges and those few that survive it go in ready and uninjured. " "I can't go back. Once the trial is started the only way out is at the other end. " "True, true. " Accidia said. "But why go on at all? You could sleep here. I have a bedroom, you wouldn't hunger or feel pain. Your boy could stay with you. If you go on further he will die with you. You are so very weak. " I hadn't seen Willim since I came out of the sitting room. "Willim will remain with or without me. " I said. I turned the key and opened the door, quick to find a point to teleport to if Accidia attacked. But he simply stood and watched me. The balcony was made of the same faded brown stone of the ballroom. A mosaic covered the floor, that of a great black crow with wings unfurled. Beyond the balcony there was only darkness. I stepped out onto the balcony and Accidia followed. "The key, please. " he asked. I handed it back to him then walked to the edge of the balcony. There was a chaotic wind in the emptiness, fierce then suddenly calm in no predictable order, as if angry spirits were trapped in the air. Far below the balcony was a distant maze. Most of it was shrouded in the same darkness as the ceiling and walls of this great chamber, if they existed at all, but creatures wandered through the maze, tormented spirits burning with a purple fire. Some were slow, a creature with a hundred arms dragging itself along. Others moved with purpose, a floating eye burning everything before it, a horned figure leading a pack of demonic hounds. If there was an exit to the maze it was lost in the darkness. "That is the trials last, and most difficult challenge. " Accidia said. "Those demons hunt endlessly for the few mortals willing to enter their lair. " I looked back into the ballroom, there was no sign of Willim. The balcony door was still open, so I hoped that Willim had slipped out, even if I couldn't see him. "Is there a way down?" I asked. "The most promising use magic. " Accidia said, a thin smile momentarily breaking his otherwise impassive face. "A simple task for air, earth or creation mages. A bit more difficult for body or force mages. " [PARAGRAPH:3] A costly spell for dimension mages though. If there was enough energy in my staff I could teleport to any area of the maze I could see. Unfortunately those were only the places that had demons roaming in them. I could throw my staff into the maze and, if it didn't break, it would light up an area. But without my staff I wouldn't be able to teleport to it. "Come rest, dream eternal and you will never know the touch of death. " Accidia said. There was the white glow of candlelight within the maze. Unlike the fiery purple of the demons this figure was small and pale. There were no demons around him and he waved his arms at me. It was Willim. How odd that in this moment, as I stood on the balcony with the demon Accidia, looking down into the infernal maze that I was likely to die in, that I would feel joy. And at the sight of a ghost. But I forced myself to be skeptical. This could be another trap. I looked through the starry eye and examined Willim, what was it that bound him to me? What was our relationship? Then I leaped from the balcony. Accidia returned to the ballroom, locking the door behind him. Maybe he would try harder to stop the next mage that passed through. Maybe he would turn into a giant tusked worm. Even considering the thought tired him, and he shambled back to the sitting room for another nap before he committed himself to anything. I fell through darkness. Teleportation takes more energy the farther you travel. The best way to reduce its cost was to get as close to the point I wanted to teleport to on my own, so I leaped into the emptiness above the maze. I hadn't expected the winds that buffeted me about. One knocked me aside, nearly into the obsidian wall beneath the balcony, and I twisted to keep Willim in sight and my staff securely in hand. My eyes were fixed on Willim, both to provide a target for my spell and because of what my divination spell had revealed. Willim's crooked smile, as he happily waved to me, was gone, replaced by a look of horror. My stomach tightened as I considered the fractions of seconds I had left before I released the spell. Then I was gone. The wind that raged around me was lost, the ground was firmly beneath my feet. I righted myself with my spell and was no longer bound by inertia of my fall. I always did have a flair for dimensional magic. But my spellstaff was dark, the spell had used the last of its magic. "I. . . I thought you fell. " Willim said. "I'm okay. But I have no magic left. We have to escape from this maze without running into any of the demons. Do you know how to get out?" "No. " Willim said. "Then follow me. " William had been standing at a corner with identical hallways going forward and to the left into darkness. Everything was constructed of the same obsidian surface as the wall beneath the balcony. The obsidian was scarred and rough at some points and perfectly smooth at others. These smooth patches acted as black mirrors and reflected corrupted versions of anything before it, or endless inky blackness. As I walked by one I saw myself withered and alone, wearing a drab grey cloak. [PARAGRAPH:3] I walked ahead, assuming the mazes exit would either be in the middle or on the opposite side from the balcony. Both would be in front of me. We walked for hours, the hallway slowly curved and I ignored archways to the right and left. I began to wonder if I had been walking around the maze in circles. I stopped and looked around, but any light coming through the windowed balcony door was blocked by the balcony. There was no indication of direction or distance. Tired of walking straight I turned right at the next intersection. This opened immediately to another passage going right and left or I could continue straight. There was a set of obsidian stairs in the middle of the intersection leading up to just over my head. They didn't lead to anything but empty air. Down the right hallway a purple fire flared against the wall. Its source was out of sight, though it was coming closer. My eyes were adjusted to Willim's pale light but it only revealed a few meters. Now this entire area was cast in reflections of purple and black. Willim and I huddled behind the staircase, afraid to run to either hallway for fear the creature was come around the corner and see us. I could hear the flames and I prayed that whatever was coming would turn and go the other way down the hallway. The purple light faded briefly then went blindingly bright. The roaring flames grew even louder, and in the polished obsidian surface of the far wall I could see the reflection of a great eye spitting wild torrents of purple flame. Waves of purple flame surrounded us as the demon got closer, setting the ground on fire except for a small patch in the staircases shadow. It was so bright I couldn't see the maze walls. Noxious black smoke choked me, and I struggled not to cough. Willim was quivering next to me. I had only the dead spellstaff in my hand. The demon floated up above the staircase and the flames began to slip away as the demon peered down the tunnel before it. Then the demon slipped over the edge of the staircase into the air above us and I could see the cracked fissures that covered the bottom of the giant eye. I held my breath as it passed over us and floated down the hallway. I sat and watched the demon silhouetted by its purple light, urging myself to get up, to run. Finally my stubborn legs obeyed and I ran down the hallway the demon had come from. Willim ran after me. I turned the corner the demon had come from. I had hoped to see an opening to sunlight or elegant double doors, but it was another hallway leading into darkness. I needed to give my eyes time to adjust to Willim's faint light so I slowed to a walk with one hand against the left wall. We walked for a few minutes in silence until I finally spoke. "I checked the relationship between us. " I said, nearly as nervous as I had been when the demon passed over us. "I brought you into the cave with me, you aren't supposed to be here. " Willim didn't answer. He walked beside me with his hands at his side. He looked older then when I had first met him in the skeleton's chamber, perhaps as old as eight. He was just beginning to trade his face's baby fat for the angular curves of boyhood. "I'm pregnant. " I continued. "You will be. . . or you are my son. " He smiled, glancing at me as I struggled to keep my face impassive. "Yes. " he said, "I am with you. " [PARAGRAPH:3] "I wouldn't have entered the trial if I had known. " I said. We walked for hours through the maze. Willim asked about my home and I told him stories of Litha temple, the rosering, the cliffs and beaches of Arune. I told him about my instructor Boann and the bard Garath Per'un, Willim's father. Without any stories of his own Willim was eager to hear all of mine and laughed and asked questions as I told them. We were so absorbed in talking that we nearly ran into the obsidian wall at yet another dead end. We turned and walked back to the last intersection. We both stopped when we heard the plodding footfalls of something huge. I huddled against the wall and signaled for Willim to hide beside me. The thumps stopped and we heard a great intake of breath, like the air being drawn into a massive bellows, followed by an exhale and then a return to silence. There was one step, more noticeable by the vibration in the floor than for its sound, and a giant head loomed into view. The head was dominated by its mouth, which was easily large enough to swallow a barrel whole. A flat nose sat atop it and small black eyes that looked comically undersized compared to the rest of the heads. What was most alarming was the placement of the head, the creature was over twice my height. My brief hope that the head floated on its own, or was attached to some frail thin body were quickly crushed. The giant, which I recognized as a Caducus, stepped into our hallway. His fat naked torso was a cage of flesh, built to contain anyone he swallowed. He would hold them trapped and helpless within his empty torso until he traveled back to hell, where he would barter with the flesh merchants of Dis, the warlords of the Bellobellum, or offer them to Camulos in tribute. He smiled when he saw me. "Run!" I shouted, and I was up and charging toward the Caducus. The only way out of this hallway was by him and I ran toward his left side, switching to his right side at the last moment in the hope that he would be unable to turn in time. He was faster than I expected and his reach made it nearly impossible to stay away from his thick hands. He reached for me and I struck his fingers with my spellstaff. The Caducus roared in pain and gave up his grab for a punch. The blow struck me in the chest and sent me into the hallway wall. Hitting the wall hurt almost as much as the punch and I fell on the ground dizzy from pain. "Run!" This time it was Willim screaming. My vision cleared as I took in the scene before me. The Caducus was holding Willim over his mouth, as I screamed he pushed Willim nearly halfway down his throat and swallowed. I felt a chill go through my body as Willim fell into the Caducus's wide stomach. I charged the Caducus with my spellstaff ready for another strike. But the Caducus was too fast and it caught my waist in one giant hand. It slammed me into a wall, hoping to quiet me long enough to swallow. The blow stunned me, but I regained my focus as he lifted me over his head and I swung my staff, striking the giant's ear. [PARAGRAPH:3] The Caducus roared and his grip loosened enough that I slipped out of his hand and onto his wide shoulders. The Caducus ripped the staff easily from my hands, and I fell against his wide head where one tiny black eye glared at me. The Caducus stumbled back against the maze wall as he tried to grab me. Standing on the creatures shoulder I could see the top of the wall and I leaped for it. The sharp edge of the obsidian wall cut across my stomach and I pulled myself up and rolled onto the top of the wall in blinding pain. But there was no time to rest, the Caducus's giant hands came over the top of the wall and he began to pull himself up after me. I looked for anything to use as a weapon, there was nothing. The darkness of the maze was broken by a small sliver of light in a grove two hallways over. A obsidian archway stood alone, but through it I could see the city of Cevedes. I knew the other side of that portal, it sat above the entrance to the Cave of Ancestors, it was the exit for the trial. The Caducus pulled himself up on the maze wall. Through the gaping holes on his torso I could see Willim, who was still too large to pass through them. Willim was yelling for me, but I couldn't hear what he was saying. A spasm of pain flashed through me, like a hand had reached into my intestines and squeezed. I stumbled toward the Caducus, unwilling to leave Willim, but unable to do anything to stop the giant. My decisions didn't matter as the Caducus was on me. He grabbed my leg and pulled me against him. I kicked helplessly. Held up against his body I reached through one of the gaping holes in his torso. I could see Willim, and feel him as he placed his hands in mine. "You can see the way out. " he said. His hands were so tiny in mine, he seemed to be growing younger. "Yes," I cried "but I can't get there. " "Use magic. " he said. A lucky kick cracked the Caducus's knee. He grabbed my throat with his other hand and squeezed. I looked for Willim through a haze of pain. "The spellstaff is your life. " Willim said, his words growing distant. "Just as I am, use me to cast your spell. " Tears blurred my vision, Willim let go of my hand I lost sight of him as the Caducus shook me again. Satisfied that I was no longer struggling the Caducus held me up to his mouth. I looked around and saw the distant portal light. I searched myself for the life inside me and found it faint and weak. Just as the Caducus stuffed me into his mouth I focused and disappeared. I could hear the Caducus scream as I stumbled through the portal and out onto the ridge overlooking Cevedes. I collapsed there my trial completed, and cried as I felt the life inside me grow cold and still. </German>
		<Italian>[PARAGRAPH] I was lost in darkness, numb to the touch of the rough stone floor I was pressed against. The final skeleton drew closer but his rattling bones dimmed in my ears. All that remained was the burning pain of my body pushed past its limits. I struggled to breathe, but the curse held me tight against the ground. I willed myself alive. Demanded that my hollow body move. My hands scraped across the floor for my staff, and I realized again that it was too far away. There was a time before I was born when I was not alive, would it be the same after my death? Was life only a short breath between twin eternities? There was no magic left in me, my mastery of entropy and dimensions was lost, a brilliant book with the last page turned. My energy had been spent defeating the golem, the blinding aurealis, and the rest of the skeletons. Powerful spells of unmaking and the between. Now I have only enough energy for adepts tricks, to sense the world through the dominions I had mastered. Dark winds whispered to me. Told me of the skeleton's weaknesses, showed me his brittle bones, his clumsy gait and the predictable swing of his pitted sword. He was a collection of vulnerabilities, but he would still kill me. If only I had my spellstaff. I spent months binding my spirit to it, investing my energy in the smooth wood so that in times like these I could draw it out. I could see it laying discarded on the floor, its dim blue glow lighting the chamber. I tried to reach it, but my body refused to move. I had rushed through the door to escape the skeleton, missed the rune, and now it bound me to the ground as if chains weighed at each part of me. Darkness returned and I was grateful I wouldn't bear timid, struggling witness to my own murder. I dreamed I was again a girl running among the flowers of Litha temple. I could feel the grass under my bare feet and smell the wild mix of flowers that bloomed in the eternal summer of the garden. The touch of smooth mahogany drew me back, the touch of my staff cupped inside my hand. The skeleton was so close his wobbling knees were all I could see, his sword was raised to strike. Though my body ignored my demands my will responded and I drew upon the staff's power. As a thing alive it reached out of me and swallowed the skeleton. His legs became brittle and splintered, dropping him to the ground. Rust consumed the pitted sword. The skeleton writhed in confusion, caught in the grip of entropy. His bones thinned, his back arched as if in some silent howl, and he fell to dust. I slipped back into unconsciousness. [PARAGRAPH:3] I dreamed of the past few weeks. Of my days in Cevedes preparing for this trial. Most suspect a mage spends this time in deep study, perusing ancient tomes or practicing spells. But the days before a trial are too late for the intense study sorcery requires. Instead we spend them in simple comfort, without casting, building our strength. I spent my days at Epona's Rest, the well appointed inn closest to the Cave of Ancestors and a frequent home to mages preparing for the trial. There are only a few mages per year that take the trial, no circle requires it, and each is a treated as a hero. Citizens visited the inn to wish me well, Stonewardens, Foxmen and Saperes come to offer blessings and advice. Drinks were bought for me and songs played in my honor. My nights were spent in my room, which overlooked both the entrance to the Cave and the obsidian archway that was the exit for those that survived it. Garath Per'un, a talented bard with boyish blond curls and a crocked smile, shared my room and we spend many nights entwined upon my bed. If I could not have the thrill of magic, than the throes of passion would suffice, and Garath brought them easily. We opened the windows and lay naked and breathless, allowing the warm summer night air to cover us with the sounds and smells of the city. The wind woke me. But unlike my dreams, this air was heavy with the odor of ruin and decay. The rune's curse had worn off and though I was sore, I could raise my arms and legs again. My staff still glowed, though it was faint, I had used much of its energy destroying the skeleton. In its pale blue light I could see that the ground was stained with blood. Others had fallen here, but there were no bodies. Another rune provided the answer to the missing bodies, a necromantic mark on the ceiling. I was unfamiliar with the symbols, but I suspect they raise any killed in this room as a skeleton. I didn't need to look at the rune on the door to know that it was a pull of the earth rune, a common trap I had been a fool to fall for. The cave continued on. Gradually sloping down as it had since I entered. I had passed through a few rooms like that of the skeletons, but I could only see rough tunnel ahead. I swore, startled, when I noticed the pale shimmer of a young boy standing in one of the tunnels shadowed recesses. The alcove had been empty when I examined it seconds before. He was a ghost, like a form lit only by a candle surrounded by a world in daylight. He wasn't threatening or sad, he simply watched me. His eyes were wide, his hands nervously straightened the folds of his loose white nightshirt that faded to nothingness at the edges. "Who are you?" I asked, lowering the tip of the staff toward him both to guard against any sudden movement and to drive the shadows out of the recess. He appeared to be alone. "A boy. " he said. His voice was thin and distant, like the wind through trees. "Are you here to attack me?" I said. He held his hands up. His lips quivered and his eyes grew wider. I felt guilty for scaring him, but I had to assume that everything in the cave was a threat. "No, I am with you. I'm just a boy. " he said. "You are a ghost. Did you die in this cave?" [PARAGRAPH:3]3 "I don't know. I don't think so. " he said. His eyes welled up with tears. I lowered my staff. Was I going to fall into another trap? But I didn't want him to cry. He was, at most, six years old. Thin, but healthy for a floating spirit. "I gave you back your staff. I didn't want the clicking man to get you. " he said. I looked at where my staff had been lying and remembered the feeling of the warm wood sliding into the palm of my hand. "Thank you, I think you saved me. " He smiled, his hands stopped wringing his shirt. "Are you here to help mages taking the trial?" I asked. He shrugged. "Have you ever helped anyone else?" I asked. "I don't think so. I don't remember anyone else. " he said. I watched him while I walked down the tunnel. He floated behind me, seemingly content. "What's your name?" I asked. He shrugged again. Noticing my skeptical look he added, "I don't know. " "I need something to call you. " He didn't suggest anything. "How about Willim?" I asked. He smiled again, but said nothing. The tunnel opened to a larger chamber. The rough stone floor gave way to green lichen so thick it almost appeared to be a layer of grass. There was a pool at the center of the chamber, the water was a deep blue and perfectly still. The tunnel continued on the far side of the chamber and the chambers ceiling was lost in darkness. For the first time I noticed how thirsty I was, and though I wasn't fool enough to drink from the pool, I was tempted. My first step on the slick lichen caused me stumble, but I caught myself and continued carefully across it. "Do you know anything about this room?" I asked. Willim looked around, studying the ground, the pool and the darkness above. "The pool is dangerous, many people have died in it. No one has died in the rest of the room. " Great, I'm traveling with a six year old necromancer. As I neared the pool a chirping echoed through the chamber. It was like a high pitched bullfrog. Soon hundreds more echoed back. It was impossible to tell which direction the sound was coming from. I hurried across the chamber, as quickly as I could without falling. Then came the sound of insect wings, an angry buzzing that reverberated through the chamber, and a fat swarm dropped out of the darkness above me. Each of the bugs was nearly the size of a chicken's egg, with a smooth black and yellow carapace, sharp mandibles curved like a Malakim scimitar and six hooked claws. [PARAGRAPH:3] The buzzing was maddening, and they flew into my hair where I could feel them crawling and searching for flesh. Others landed on my face and arms where they bit through my robes and into my back, chest and legs. I couldn't see beyond the swarming mass of black and yellow. I slipped again, coming down hard at the pools edge. I waved the bugs away from my face but dozens of stings on my arms and body made them feel like I was on fire. I cried out as one found the back of my neck. I was tempted again by the pool, the promised relief from the bugs and the burning. I slid but stopped myself at the pools edge. I held myself there, staring into the depths where the green lichen disappeared into the blue. Barely visible within the pools depths I could see two milky eyes looking up at me, waiting. Taking a breath I scrambled up along the side of the pool. I swung my staff as much to hit the swarm as to shake off those biting my arms. The far tunnel blurred as tears from pain, frustration and panic filled my eyes. I had so little energy left, but I ignored the bites, ignored the buzzing, ignored the kaleidoscope of yellow and black around me and focused as far into the tunnel as I could see. In that instant the bugs covered me like a blanket of swarming carapaces and thin wings, and I teleported into the tunnel. The bugs collapsed to the floor, for a confused minute the buzzing faded. A bug dropped and fell into the pool. It was quickly pulled beneath by a hooked tendril. I ran down the tunnel away from the chamber. I was bleeding from dozens of bites on my arms, neck and face. The swarm gave chase, its buzzing was even louder in the smaller tunnel. The slick floor gave way to smooth, dry stone, the humidity to a dry warmth. I could see the red glow of a furnace ahead. Willim floated after me, the bugs passed harmlessly through him. He looked behind us, eyes wide at the approaching swarm and equally afraid of the wall of fire that blocked our path. I looked again through the entropic eye. The fire was weak, a thin wall easily put out by a basic water spell. But this was one trap I needed. "Is it safe on the other side?" I panted. Willim rushed ahead, a pale blur up into the fire. He came quickly back. "Yes. " he said. It was all I had time to hear, I jumped through the fire. Through the flash of heat there was a damp, choking darkness. At first I thought it was a sewer, it was the only thing I could imagine that would smell this bad and my legs sunk nearly to my waist in thick sludge. But there was writhing within the sludge, something licked my ankle. I knew of them from my studies, Lemures. The wall of flame still burned behind me, and I backed up to it in disgust. Lemures are the least of demons, those souls with so little conviction that they spent eternity in pools of their own excrement, releasing and consuming their own waste until they become soft, bloated bags of demonic flesh. [PARAGRAPH:3] A ripple broke the sludge's thick skin, something moved underneath. Willim walked through the fire behind me. "There is a horrible creature ahead. A demon of sadness and misery. " he said. There was a tunnel entrance on the opposite side of the bowl shaped room. Black, greasy walls sloped down into the sludge as if carved out by an underground river. "Is there anything in the sludge except for the Lemures?" I asked. Willim looked confused. "The demons in the sludge, they are lethargy spirits, unable to act. Is there anything more dangerous in the sludge?" "These are the souls of those that have given up. Mages to tired or afraid to continue. But no, there is nothing here except for them. " he said. I started through the pool. I stepped on something thick and eely, it recoiled from my touch and set off a series of ripples and wet shrieks that echoed around the small room. I continued across, staff held above the surface. Though I was willing to risk my legs to the creatures touch, I wouldn't risk the staff. "What are the symbols on your hands?" William asked. A large mass moved in the sludge and I stopped, waiting to see if it was a single large body moving toward me or several smaller Lemures jostling for position. In front of me the sludge was just watery enough that I could see a withered human arm curled up against a bloated form below the surface. "They are tattoos. " I said working around the body floating in front of me. "The one of my left is the starry eye, the symbol for dimensional magic. On my left I have the immundus, the symbol for entropic magic. " The conversation helped me ignore my disgusting task. Willim simply floated above the sludge, as calm here as he was in the skeletons chamber. "How did you learn about the spirits in these rooms?" I asked. "The fire and bugs aren't very real to me. They look like shadows. Other things are more real. The screams of those that died in the pool, the spirits of those trapped here. " Willim trailed off, staring into the sludge. I called for him to begin following me again. "But you can touch some things. " I said. "You gave me my staff. " "Yes, the shadows are real, they are just very. . . " his brow furrowed as he searched for the right word. "Faint?" I offered. He nodded. The floor began rising as I got close to the edge of the pool. I was glad to be out of it, though the bottom half of my carnelian robes were now stained brown. Fetid orange masses thick with purple veins [PARAGRAPH:3] clung to me, and I scraped them off with my staff. I was thankful my stomach was empty as I suppressed the urge to vomit. I almost preferred the comfort of the pool chamber and the biting swarm. For the first time the rough stone floor of the cave was replaced by terra cotta tiles. They were cracked and ancient near the edge of the sludge, with numerous gaps. As I walked the condition improved until they were uniform and undamaged. The walls gradually became more even, and I wondered if the trial was over. Willim grew more apprehensive as we walked and was wringing his hands in his nightshirt again. The tunnel opened into a ballroom decorated with mosaics so faded it was impossible to tell what they had once been. A elegant windowed double door was on the opposite wall. A balcony was barely visible through the doors thick and rippled glass panes. From the ballroom four smaller archways opened up to comfortable rooms. A bedroom, a study, a small sitting room and a dining room. I crossed to the windowed doorway and after checking to make sure there were no runes or obvious signs of a trap I turned the handle, it was locked. "Can you look on the other side?" I asked. Willim nodded, then stopped confused as his ghostly hand was blocked by the door. "I can't. " Willim said, his thin voice was higher than usual. I concentrated on the lock. Adepts assume that the dimension sphere was all about teleportation, as that was its most useful feat. But it is the magic of the between, of relationships, and of binding. Through the starry eye, as my mentor Boann referred to this minor feat, I could see the relationships between objects. Staring at the lock I saw a vision, a brass key with a long crenelated blade and odd triangular teeth. "We need a key. " I said. I considered teleporting to the other side of the door. I could see enough of the balcony to appear there, but I didn't want to leave Willim behind. I was also worried that a spell that powerful would leave me empty and defenseless to whatever awaited me in the far room. "Can you pass through the wall beside the door?" I asked. He ran his hands along the faded mosaics beside the door. "No. " The same was true when he tried to pass through the floor. "Let's search the side rooms for the key. " I said. As I turned back I noticed the wet trail I had left across the ball room. My robes were still soiled by the sludge, and beneath my legs were a greasy brown. A few bugs had bitten shallow wounds on my legs, and they were already inflamed and oozing a thick white puss. "Has anyone died in here?" I asked. "I don't think so, but this is a very sad place. " William said. I walked toward the bedroom, then peeked inside. It was well appointed but empty. Like the ballroom it had once been elegant. A layer of dust covered the white and green bedspread, and a dresser had a sheet over its tall mirror as if it was in storage. A women's hairbrush sat on the otherwise bare dresser. [PARAGRAPH:3] The next archway opened to a small sitting room. A pair of frayed, but comfortable looking chairs sat facing a matching sofa. In the blue light of my staff I could see a figure sleeping on the sofa. I slipped into the room, careful to keep a chair between myself and the figure. As I got closer I could hear his horse breaths. He wore an open blue jacket with tarnished gold buttons. Beneath his jacket a once white shirt was now yellowed. His considerable jowls hung over a thick neck and his graying hair was pulled back in a simple knot. His reminded me of a goat, except that a goat would be more threatening. His skin was loose and flaccid, his skinny legs supported a round pear shaped body. He wasn't a fit man grown lax in his later years, but a man that had never been fit. And on a chain around his neck hung a brass key with a crenelated blade and odd triangular teeth. I closed my eyes and focused. When I opened them I could see through the entropic eye. Despite his pathetic appearance there was little weakness in sleeping demon, for now I knew he was no man. Haligfyr, the holy fire that once lit the temples of Bhall, would destroy him. Powerful spells of sanctuary or binding could restrain him. But there was nothing I could do except run from him. He snorted, nearly choking on his own tongue, then rolled clumsily onto his side and began coughing. Willim fled the room, peeking back nervously into the archway, keeping me in sight but hiding from the coughing demon. With a face red from the force of his coughs the demon finally noticed me. He went quiet, looking nervously around to see if there was anyone else in the small sitting room. "Do you have anything to drink?" he asked as he buttoned up his blue coat. The buttons strained against his wide stomach. "No. " I said. "Then why are you sneaking about my sitting room?" He tried to straighten his hair but only managed to mess it up further. He gave up in frustration. "I'm traveling through this cave. I need to get through the windowed door. " It seemed wrong to be honest with him, but I couldn't think of a lie that would help. "Oh. " he said. He considered as if trying to remember something, then looked up suddenly. "Do you want the key?" "Yes. " I said. He took the chain off and held it out to me. He stood there, arm out toward me, hand up with the brass key and coils of the chain sitting in the palm of his hand. He yawned as he waited for me to take it. "It can't be that easy. You're simply going to give me the key?" I asked. "I'm probably supposed to stop you. Transform into some giant tusked worm and then fight to the death. But I simply haven't got it in me. " "You're afraid?" I said. He smiled. "No. Your spell staff is dim, you might have enough energy for one more spell. And I assume it wasn't like this when you entered the trial. So you have used it. You wouldn't have done that if you have any energy left yourself. You are nearly dead. I could fight you, I could kill you. But why? I would rather return to my nap. " [PARAGRAPH:3]8 Tired of holding out his arm the demon walked out into the ballroom. I followed, my staff between us. He walked to the windowed door and put the key into the keyhole. "Who are you?" I asked. He considered before answering, "Accidia. " Then he stepped away from the door, leaving the key unturned in the lock. "Who are you?" he asked. Again I couldn't think of a reason to lie, "Tya Kiri, student of Litha temple. " I stepped toward the door, Accidia yawned again. Just before I touched the key Accidia added, "You are going to die in the next room. It is the worst of the challenges and those few that survive it go in ready and uninjured. " "I can't go back. Once the trial is started the only way out is at the other end. " "True, true. " Accidia said. "But why go on at all? You could sleep here. I have a bedroom, you wouldn't hunger or feel pain. Your boy could stay with you. If you go on further he will die with you. You are so very weak. " I hadn't seen Willim since I came out of the sitting room. "Willim will remain with or without me. " I said. I turned the key and opened the door, quick to find a point to teleport to if Accidia attacked. But he simply stood and watched me. The balcony was made of the same faded brown stone of the ballroom. A mosaic covered the floor, that of a great black crow with wings unfurled. Beyond the balcony there was only darkness. I stepped out onto the balcony and Accidia followed. "The key, please. " he asked. I handed it back to him then walked to the edge of the balcony. There was a chaotic wind in the emptiness, fierce then suddenly calm in no predictable order, as if angry spirits were trapped in the air. Far below the balcony was a distant maze. Most of it was shrouded in the same darkness as the ceiling and walls of this great chamber, if they existed at all, but creatures wandered through the maze, tormented spirits burning with a purple fire. Some were slow, a creature with a hundred arms dragging itself along. Others moved with purpose, a floating eye burning everything before it, a horned figure leading a pack of demonic hounds. If there was an exit to the maze it was lost in the darkness. "That is the trials last, and most difficult challenge. " Accidia said. "Those demons hunt endlessly for the few mortals willing to enter their lair. " I looked back into the ballroom, there was no sign of Willim. The balcony door was still open, so I hoped that Willim had slipped out, even if I couldn't see him. "Is there a way down?" I asked. "The most promising use magic. " Accidia said, a thin smile momentarily breaking his otherwise impassive face. "A simple task for air, earth or creation mages. A bit more difficult for body or force mages. " [PARAGRAPH:3] A costly spell for dimension mages though. If there was enough energy in my staff I could teleport to any area of the maze I could see. Unfortunately those were only the places that had demons roaming in them. I could throw my staff into the maze and, if it didn't break, it would light up an area. But without my staff I wouldn't be able to teleport to it. "Come rest, dream eternal and you will never know the touch of death. " Accidia said. There was the white glow of candlelight within the maze. Unlike the fiery purple of the demons this figure was small and pale. There were no demons around him and he waved his arms at me. It was Willim. How odd that in this moment, as I stood on the balcony with the demon Accidia, looking down into the infernal maze that I was likely to die in, that I would feel joy. And at the sight of a ghost. But I forced myself to be skeptical. This could be another trap. I looked through the starry eye and examined Willim, what was it that bound him to me? What was our relationship? Then I leaped from the balcony. Accidia returned to the ballroom, locking the door behind him. Maybe he would try harder to stop the next mage that passed through. Maybe he would turn into a giant tusked worm. Even considering the thought tired him, and he shambled back to the sitting room for another nap before he committed himself to anything. I fell through darkness. Teleportation takes more energy the farther you travel. The best way to reduce its cost was to get as close to the point I wanted to teleport to on my own, so I leaped into the emptiness above the maze. I hadn't expected the winds that buffeted me about. One knocked me aside, nearly into the obsidian wall beneath the balcony, and I twisted to keep Willim in sight and my staff securely in hand. My eyes were fixed on Willim, both to provide a target for my spell and because of what my divination spell had revealed. Willim's crooked smile, as he happily waved to me, was gone, replaced by a look of horror. My stomach tightened as I considered the fractions of seconds I had left before I released the spell. Then I was gone. The wind that raged around me was lost, the ground was firmly beneath my feet. I righted myself with my spell and was no longer bound by inertia of my fall. I always did have a flair for dimensional magic. But my spellstaff was dark, the spell had used the last of its magic. "I. . . I thought you fell. " Willim said. "I'm okay. But I have no magic left. We have to escape from this maze without running into any of the demons. Do you know how to get out?" "No. " Willim said. "Then follow me. " William had been standing at a corner with identical hallways going forward and to the left into darkness. Everything was constructed of the same obsidian surface as the wall beneath the balcony. The obsidian was scarred and rough at some points and perfectly smooth at others. These smooth patches acted as black mirrors and reflected corrupted versions of anything before it, or endless inky blackness. As I walked by one I saw myself withered and alone, wearing a drab grey cloak. [PARAGRAPH:3] I walked ahead, assuming the mazes exit would either be in the middle or on the opposite side from the balcony. Both would be in front of me. We walked for hours, the hallway slowly curved and I ignored archways to the right and left. I began to wonder if I had been walking around the maze in circles. I stopped and looked around, but any light coming through the windowed balcony door was blocked by the balcony. There was no indication of direction or distance. Tired of walking straight I turned right at the next intersection. This opened immediately to another passage going right and left or I could continue straight. There was a set of obsidian stairs in the middle of the intersection leading up to just over my head. They didn't lead to anything but empty air. Down the right hallway a purple fire flared against the wall. Its source was out of sight, though it was coming closer. My eyes were adjusted to Willim's pale light but it only revealed a few meters. Now this entire area was cast in reflections of purple and black. Willim and I huddled behind the staircase, afraid to run to either hallway for fear the creature was come around the corner and see us. I could hear the flames and I prayed that whatever was coming would turn and go the other way down the hallway. The purple light faded briefly then went blindingly bright. The roaring flames grew even louder, and in the polished obsidian surface of the far wall I could see the reflection of a great eye spitting wild torrents of purple flame. Waves of purple flame surrounded us as the demon got closer, setting the ground on fire except for a small patch in the staircases shadow. It was so bright I couldn't see the maze walls. Noxious black smoke choked me, and I struggled not to cough. Willim was quivering next to me. I had only the dead spellstaff in my hand. The demon floated up above the staircase and the flames began to slip away as the demon peered down the tunnel before it. Then the demon slipped over the edge of the staircase into the air above us and I could see the cracked fissures that covered the bottom of the giant eye. I held my breath as it passed over us and floated down the hallway. I sat and watched the demon silhouetted by its purple light, urging myself to get up, to run. Finally my stubborn legs obeyed and I ran down the hallway the demon had come from. Willim ran after me. I turned the corner the demon had come from. I had hoped to see an opening to sunlight or elegant double doors, but it was another hallway leading into darkness. I needed to give my eyes time to adjust to Willim's faint light so I slowed to a walk with one hand against the left wall. We walked for a few minutes in silence until I finally spoke. "I checked the relationship between us. " I said, nearly as nervous as I had been when the demon passed over us. "I brought you into the cave with me, you aren't supposed to be here. " Willim didn't answer. He walked beside me with his hands at his side. He looked older then when I had first met him in the skeleton's chamber, perhaps as old as eight. He was just beginning to trade his face's baby fat for the angular curves of boyhood. "I'm pregnant. " I continued. "You will be. . . or you are my son. " He smiled, glancing at me as I struggled to keep my face impassive. "Yes. " he said, "I am with you. " [PARAGRAPH:3] "I wouldn't have entered the trial if I had known. " I said. We walked for hours through the maze. Willim asked about my home and I told him stories of Litha temple, the rosering, the cliffs and beaches of Arune. I told him about my instructor Boann and the bard Garath Per'un, Willim's father. Without any stories of his own Willim was eager to hear all of mine and laughed and asked questions as I told them. We were so absorbed in talking that we nearly ran into the obsidian wall at yet another dead end. We turned and walked back to the last intersection. We both stopped when we heard the plodding footfalls of something huge. I huddled against the wall and signaled for Willim to hide beside me. The thumps stopped and we heard a great intake of breath, like the air being drawn into a massive bellows, followed by an exhale and then a return to silence. There was one step, more noticeable by the vibration in the floor than for its sound, and a giant head loomed into view. The head was dominated by its mouth, which was easily large enough to swallow a barrel whole. A flat nose sat atop it and small black eyes that looked comically undersized compared to the rest of the heads. What was most alarming was the placement of the head, the creature was over twice my height. My brief hope that the head floated on its own, or was attached to some frail thin body were quickly crushed. The giant, which I recognized as a Caducus, stepped into our hallway. His fat naked torso was a cage of flesh, built to contain anyone he swallowed. He would hold them trapped and helpless within his empty torso until he traveled back to hell, where he would barter with the flesh merchants of Dis, the warlords of the Bellobellum, or offer them to Camulos in tribute. He smiled when he saw me. "Run!" I shouted, and I was up and charging toward the Caducus. The only way out of this hallway was by him and I ran toward his left side, switching to his right side at the last moment in the hope that he would be unable to turn in time. He was faster than I expected and his reach made it nearly impossible to stay away from his thick hands. He reached for me and I struck his fingers with my spellstaff. The Caducus roared in pain and gave up his grab for a punch. The blow struck me in the chest and sent me into the hallway wall. Hitting the wall hurt almost as much as the punch and I fell on the ground dizzy from pain. "Run!" This time it was Willim screaming. My vision cleared as I took in the scene before me. The Caducus was holding Willim over his mouth, as I screamed he pushed Willim nearly halfway down his throat and swallowed. I felt a chill go through my body as Willim fell into the Caducus's wide stomach. I charged the Caducus with my spellstaff ready for another strike. But the Caducus was too fast and it caught my waist in one giant hand. It slammed me into a wall, hoping to quiet me long enough to swallow. The blow stunned me, but I regained my focus as he lifted me over his head and I swung my staff, striking the giant's ear. [PARAGRAPH:3] The Caducus roared and his grip loosened enough that I slipped out of his hand and onto his wide shoulders. The Caducus ripped the staff easily from my hands, and I fell against his wide head where one tiny black eye glared at me. The Caducus stumbled back against the maze wall as he tried to grab me. Standing on the creatures shoulder I could see the top of the wall and I leaped for it. The sharp edge of the obsidian wall cut across my stomach and I pulled myself up and rolled onto the top of the wall in blinding pain. But there was no time to rest, the Caducus's giant hands came over the top of the wall and he began to pull himself up after me. I looked for anything to use as a weapon, there was nothing. The darkness of the maze was broken by a small sliver of light in a grove two hallways over. A obsidian archway stood alone, but through it I could see the city of Cevedes. I knew the other side of that portal, it sat above the entrance to the Cave of Ancestors, it was the exit for the trial. The Caducus pulled himself up on the maze wall. Through the gaping holes on his torso I could see Willim, who was still too large to pass through them. Willim was yelling for me, but I couldn't hear what he was saying. A spasm of pain flashed through me, like a hand had reached into my intestines and squeezed. I stumbled toward the Caducus, unwilling to leave Willim, but unable to do anything to stop the giant. My decisions didn't matter as the Caducus was on me. He grabbed my leg and pulled me against him. I kicked helplessly. Held up against his body I reached through one of the gaping holes in his torso. I could see Willim, and feel him as he placed his hands in mine. "You can see the way out. " he said. His hands were so tiny in mine, he seemed to be growing younger. "Yes," I cried "but I can't get there. " "Use magic. " he said. A lucky kick cracked the Caducus's knee. He grabbed my throat with his other hand and squeezed. I looked for Willim through a haze of pain. "The spellstaff is your life. " Willim said, his words growing distant. "Just as I am, use me to cast your spell. " Tears blurred my vision, Willim let go of my hand I lost sight of him as the Caducus shook me again. Satisfied that I was no longer struggling the Caducus held me up to his mouth. I looked around and saw the distant portal light. I searched myself for the life inside me and found it faint and weak. Just as the Caducus stuffed me into his mouth I focused and disappeared. I could hear the Caducus scream as I stumbled through the portal and out onto the ridge overlooking Cevedes. I collapsed there my trial completed, and cried as I felt the life inside me grow cold and still. </Italian>
		<Spanish>[PARAGRAPH] I was lost in darkness, numb to the touch of the rough stone floor I was pressed against. The final skeleton drew closer but his rattling bones dimmed in my ears. All that remained was the burning pain of my body pushed past its limits. I struggled to breathe, but the curse held me tight against the ground. I willed myself alive. Demanded that my hollow body move. My hands scraped across the floor for my staff, and I realized again that it was too far away. There was a time before I was born when I was not alive, would it be the same after my death? Was life only a short breath between twin eternities? There was no magic left in me, my mastery of entropy and dimensions was lost, a brilliant book with the last page turned. My energy had been spent defeating the golem, the blinding aurealis, and the rest of the skeletons. Powerful spells of unmaking and the between. Now I have only enough energy for adepts tricks, to sense the world through the dominions I had mastered. Dark winds whispered to me. Told me of the skeleton's weaknesses, showed me his brittle bones, his clumsy gait and the predictable swing of his pitted sword. He was a collection of vulnerabilities, but he would still kill me. If only I had my spellstaff. I spent months binding my spirit to it, investing my energy in the smooth wood so that in times like these I could draw it out. I could see it laying discarded on the floor, its dim blue glow lighting the chamber. I tried to reach it, but my body refused to move. I had rushed through the door to escape the skeleton, missed the rune, and now it bound me to the ground as if chains weighed at each part of me. Darkness returned and I was grateful I wouldn't bear timid, struggling witness to my own murder. I dreamed I was again a girl running among the flowers of Litha temple. I could feel the grass under my bare feet and smell the wild mix of flowers that bloomed in the eternal summer of the garden. The touch of smooth mahogany drew me back, the touch of my staff cupped inside my hand. The skeleton was so close his wobbling knees were all I could see, his sword was raised to strike. Though my body ignored my demands my will responded and I drew upon the staff's power. As a thing alive it reached out of me and swallowed the skeleton. His legs became brittle and splintered, dropping him to the ground. Rust consumed the pitted sword. The skeleton writhed in confusion, caught in the grip of entropy. His bones thinned, his back arched as if in some silent howl, and he fell to dust. I slipped back into unconsciousness. [PARAGRAPH:3] I dreamed of the past few weeks. Of my days in Cevedes preparing for this trial. Most suspect a mage spends this time in deep study, perusing ancient tomes or practicing spells. But the days before a trial are too late for the intense study sorcery requires. Instead we spend them in simple comfort, without casting, building our strength. I spent my days at Epona's Rest, the well appointed inn closest to the Cave of Ancestors and a frequent home to mages preparing for the trial. There are only a few mages per year that take the trial, no circle requires it, and each is a treated as a hero. Citizens visited the inn to wish me well, Stonewardens, Foxmen and Saperes come to offer blessings and advice. Drinks were bought for me and songs played in my honor. My nights were spent in my room, which overlooked both the entrance to the Cave and the obsidian archway that was the exit for those that survived it. Garath Per'un, a talented bard with boyish blond curls and a crocked smile, shared my room and we spend many nights entwined upon my bed. If I could not have the thrill of magic, than the throes of passion would suffice, and Garath brought them easily. We opened the windows and lay naked and breathless, allowing the warm summer night air to cover us with the sounds and smells of the city. The wind woke me. But unlike my dreams, this air was heavy with the odor of ruin and decay. The rune's curse had worn off and though I was sore, I could raise my arms and legs again. My staff still glowed, though it was faint, I had used much of its energy destroying the skeleton. In its pale blue light I could see that the ground was stained with blood. Others had fallen here, but there were no bodies. Another rune provided the answer to the missing bodies, a necromantic mark on the ceiling. I was unfamiliar with the symbols, but I suspect they raise any killed in this room as a skeleton. I didn't need to look at the rune on the door to know that it was a pull of the earth rune, a common trap I had been a fool to fall for. The cave continued on. Gradually sloping down as it had since I entered. I had passed through a few rooms like that of the skeletons, but I could only see rough tunnel ahead. I swore, startled, when I noticed the pale shimmer of a young boy standing in one of the tunnels shadowed recesses. The alcove had been empty when I examined it seconds before. He was a ghost, like a form lit only by a candle surrounded by a world in daylight. He wasn't threatening or sad, he simply watched me. His eyes were wide, his hands nervously straightened the folds of his loose white nightshirt that faded to nothingness at the edges. "Who are you?" I asked, lowering the tip of the staff toward him both to guard against any sudden movement and to drive the shadows out of the recess. He appeared to be alone. "A boy. " he said. His voice was thin and distant, like the wind through trees. "Are you here to attack me?" I said. He held his hands up. His lips quivered and his eyes grew wider. I felt guilty for scaring him, but I had to assume that everything in the cave was a threat. "No, I am with you. I'm just a boy. " he said. "You are a ghost. Did you die in this cave?" [PARAGRAPH:3]3 "I don't know. I don't think so. " he said. His eyes welled up with tears. I lowered my staff. Was I going to fall into another trap? But I didn't want him to cry. He was, at most, six years old. Thin, but healthy for a floating spirit. "I gave you back your staff. I didn't want the clicking man to get you. " he said. I looked at where my staff had been lying and remembered the feeling of the warm wood sliding into the palm of my hand. "Thank you, I think you saved me. " He smiled, his hands stopped wringing his shirt. "Are you here to help mages taking the trial?" I asked. He shrugged. "Have you ever helped anyone else?" I asked. "I don't think so. I don't remember anyone else. " he said. I watched him while I walked down the tunnel. He floated behind me, seemingly content. "What's your name?" I asked. He shrugged again. Noticing my skeptical look he added, "I don't know. " "I need something to call you. " He didn't suggest anything. "How about Willim?" I asked. He smiled again, but said nothing. The tunnel opened to a larger chamber. The rough stone floor gave way to green lichen so thick it almost appeared to be a layer of grass. There was a pool at the center of the chamber, the water was a deep blue and perfectly still. The tunnel continued on the far side of the chamber and the chambers ceiling was lost in darkness. For the first time I noticed how thirsty I was, and though I wasn't fool enough to drink from the pool, I was tempted. My first step on the slick lichen caused me stumble, but I caught myself and continued carefully across it. "Do you know anything about this room?" I asked. Willim looked around, studying the ground, the pool and the darkness above. "The pool is dangerous, many people have died in it. No one has died in the rest of the room. " Great, I'm traveling with a six year old necromancer. As I neared the pool a chirping echoed through the chamber. It was like a high pitched bullfrog. Soon hundreds more echoed back. It was impossible to tell which direction the sound was coming from. I hurried across the chamber, as quickly as I could without falling. Then came the sound of insect wings, an angry buzzing that reverberated through the chamber, and a fat swarm dropped out of the darkness above me. Each of the bugs was nearly the size of a chicken's egg, with a smooth black and yellow carapace, sharp mandibles curved like a Malakim scimitar and six hooked claws. [PARAGRAPH:3] The buzzing was maddening, and they flew into my hair where I could feel them crawling and searching for flesh. Others landed on my face and arms where they bit through my robes and into my back, chest and legs. I couldn't see beyond the swarming mass of black and yellow. I slipped again, coming down hard at the pools edge. I waved the bugs away from my face but dozens of stings on my arms and body made them feel like I was on fire. I cried out as one found the back of my neck. I was tempted again by the pool, the promised relief from the bugs and the burning. I slid but stopped myself at the pools edge. I held myself there, staring into the depths where the green lichen disappeared into the blue. Barely visible within the pools depths I could see two milky eyes looking up at me, waiting. Taking a breath I scrambled up along the side of the pool. I swung my staff as much to hit the swarm as to shake off those biting my arms. The far tunnel blurred as tears from pain, frustration and panic filled my eyes. I had so little energy left, but I ignored the bites, ignored the buzzing, ignored the kaleidoscope of yellow and black around me and focused as far into the tunnel as I could see. In that instant the bugs covered me like a blanket of swarming carapaces and thin wings, and I teleported into the tunnel. The bugs collapsed to the floor, for a confused minute the buzzing faded. A bug dropped and fell into the pool. It was quickly pulled beneath by a hooked tendril. I ran down the tunnel away from the chamber. I was bleeding from dozens of bites on my arms, neck and face. The swarm gave chase, its buzzing was even louder in the smaller tunnel. The slick floor gave way to smooth, dry stone, the humidity to a dry warmth. I could see the red glow of a furnace ahead. Willim floated after me, the bugs passed harmlessly through him. He looked behind us, eyes wide at the approaching swarm and equally afraid of the wall of fire that blocked our path. I looked again through the entropic eye. The fire was weak, a thin wall easily put out by a basic water spell. But this was one trap I needed. "Is it safe on the other side?" I panted. Willim rushed ahead, a pale blur up into the fire. He came quickly back. "Yes. " he said. It was all I had time to hear, I jumped through the fire. Through the flash of heat there was a damp, choking darkness. At first I thought it was a sewer, it was the only thing I could imagine that would smell this bad and my legs sunk nearly to my waist in thick sludge. But there was writhing within the sludge, something licked my ankle. I knew of them from my studies, Lemures. The wall of flame still burned behind me, and I backed up to it in disgust. Lemures are the least of demons, those souls with so little conviction that they spent eternity in pools of their own excrement, releasing and consuming their own waste until they become soft, bloated bags of demonic flesh. [PARAGRAPH:3] A ripple broke the sludge's thick skin, something moved underneath. Willim walked through the fire behind me. "There is a horrible creature ahead. A demon of sadness and misery. " he said. There was a tunnel entrance on the opposite side of the bowl shaped room. Black, greasy walls sloped down into the sludge as if carved out by an underground river. "Is there anything in the sludge except for the Lemures?" I asked. Willim looked confused. "The demons in the sludge, they are lethargy spirits, unable to act. Is there anything more dangerous in the sludge?" "These are the souls of those that have given up. Mages to tired or afraid to continue. But no, there is nothing here except for them. " he said. I started through the pool. I stepped on something thick and eely, it recoiled from my touch and set off a series of ripples and wet shrieks that echoed around the small room. I continued across, staff held above the surface. Though I was willing to risk my legs to the creatures touch, I wouldn't risk the staff. "What are the symbols on your hands?" William asked. A large mass moved in the sludge and I stopped, waiting to see if it was a single large body moving toward me or several smaller Lemures jostling for position. In front of me the sludge was just watery enough that I could see a withered human arm curled up against a bloated form below the surface. "They are tattoos. " I said working around the body floating in front of me. "The one of my left is the starry eye, the symbol for dimensional magic. On my left I have the immundus, the symbol for entropic magic. " The conversation helped me ignore my disgusting task. Willim simply floated above the sludge, as calm here as he was in the skeletons chamber. "How did you learn about the spirits in these rooms?" I asked. "The fire and bugs aren't very real to me. They look like shadows. Other things are more real. The screams of those that died in the pool, the spirits of those trapped here. " Willim trailed off, staring into the sludge. I called for him to begin following me again. "But you can touch some things. " I said. "You gave me my staff. " "Yes, the shadows are real, they are just very. . . " his brow furrowed as he searched for the right word. "Faint?" I offered. He nodded. The floor began rising as I got close to the edge of the pool. I was glad to be out of it, though the bottom half of my carnelian robes were now stained brown. Fetid orange masses thick with purple veins [PARAGRAPH:3] clung to me, and I scraped them off with my staff. I was thankful my stomach was empty as I suppressed the urge to vomit. I almost preferred the comfort of the pool chamber and the biting swarm. For the first time the rough stone floor of the cave was replaced by terra cotta tiles. They were cracked and ancient near the edge of the sludge, with numerous gaps. As I walked the condition improved until they were uniform and undamaged. The walls gradually became more even, and I wondered if the trial was over. Willim grew more apprehensive as we walked and was wringing his hands in his nightshirt again. The tunnel opened into a ballroom decorated with mosaics so faded it was impossible to tell what they had once been. A elegant windowed double door was on the opposite wall. A balcony was barely visible through the doors thick and rippled glass panes. From the ballroom four smaller archways opened up to comfortable rooms. A bedroom, a study, a small sitting room and a dining room. I crossed to the windowed doorway and after checking to make sure there were no runes or obvious signs of a trap I turned the handle, it was locked. "Can you look on the other side?" I asked. Willim nodded, then stopped confused as his ghostly hand was blocked by the door. "I can't. " Willim said, his thin voice was higher than usual. I concentrated on the lock. Adepts assume that the dimension sphere was all about teleportation, as that was its most useful feat. But it is the magic of the between, of relationships, and of binding. Through the starry eye, as my mentor Boann referred to this minor feat, I could see the relationships between objects. Staring at the lock I saw a vision, a brass key with a long crenelated blade and odd triangular teeth. "We need a key. " I said. I considered teleporting to the other side of the door. I could see enough of the balcony to appear there, but I didn't want to leave Willim behind. I was also worried that a spell that powerful would leave me empty and defenseless to whatever awaited me in the far room. "Can you pass through the wall beside the door?" I asked. He ran his hands along the faded mosaics beside the door. "No. " The same was true when he tried to pass through the floor. "Let's search the side rooms for the key. " I said. As I turned back I noticed the wet trail I had left across the ball room. My robes were still soiled by the sludge, and beneath my legs were a greasy brown. A few bugs had bitten shallow wounds on my legs, and they were already inflamed and oozing a thick white puss. "Has anyone died in here?" I asked. "I don't think so, but this is a very sad place. " William said. I walked toward the bedroom, then peeked inside. It was well appointed but empty. Like the ballroom it had once been elegant. A layer of dust covered the white and green bedspread, and a dresser had a sheet over its tall mirror as if it was in storage. A women's hairbrush sat on the otherwise bare dresser. [PARAGRAPH:3] The next archway opened to a small sitting room. A pair of frayed, but comfortable looking chairs sat facing a matching sofa. In the blue light of my staff I could see a figure sleeping on the sofa. I slipped into the room, careful to keep a chair between myself and the figure. As I got closer I could hear his horse breaths. He wore an open blue jacket with tarnished gold buttons. Beneath his jacket a once white shirt was now yellowed. His considerable jowls hung over a thick neck and his graying hair was pulled back in a simple knot. His reminded me of a goat, except that a goat would be more threatening. His skin was loose and flaccid, his skinny legs supported a round pear shaped body. He wasn't a fit man grown lax in his later years, but a man that had never been fit. And on a chain around his neck hung a brass key with a crenelated blade and odd triangular teeth. I closed my eyes and focused. When I opened them I could see through the entropic eye. Despite his pathetic appearance there was little weakness in sleeping demon, for now I knew he was no man. Haligfyr, the holy fire that once lit the temples of Bhall, would destroy him. Powerful spells of sanctuary or binding could restrain him. But there was nothing I could do except run from him. He snorted, nearly choking on his own tongue, then rolled clumsily onto his side and began coughing. Willim fled the room, peeking back nervously into the archway, keeping me in sight but hiding from the coughing demon. With a face red from the force of his coughs the demon finally noticed me. He went quiet, looking nervously around to see if there was anyone else in the small sitting room. "Do you have anything to drink?" he asked as he buttoned up his blue coat. The buttons strained against his wide stomach. "No. " I said. "Then why are you sneaking about my sitting room?" He tried to straighten his hair but only managed to mess it up further. He gave up in frustration. "I'm traveling through this cave. I need to get through the windowed door. " It seemed wrong to be honest with him, but I couldn't think of a lie that would help. "Oh. " he said. He considered as if trying to remember something, then looked up suddenly. "Do you want the key?" "Yes. " I said. He took the chain off and held it out to me. He stood there, arm out toward me, hand up with the brass key and coils of the chain sitting in the palm of his hand. He yawned as he waited for me to take it. "It can't be that easy. You're simply going to give me the key?" I asked. "I'm probably supposed to stop you. Transform into some giant tusked worm and then fight to the death. But I simply haven't got it in me. " "You're afraid?" I said. He smiled. "No. Your spell staff is dim, you might have enough energy for one more spell. And I assume it wasn't like this when you entered the trial. So you have used it. You wouldn't have done that if you have any energy left yourself. You are nearly dead. I could fight you, I could kill you. But why? I would rather return to my nap. " [PARAGRAPH:3]8 Tired of holding out his arm the demon walked out into the ballroom. I followed, my staff between us. He walked to the windowed door and put the key into the keyhole. "Who are you?" I asked. He considered before answering, "Accidia. " Then he stepped away from the door, leaving the key unturned in the lock. "Who are you?" he asked. Again I couldn't think of a reason to lie, "Tya Kiri, student of Litha temple. " I stepped toward the door, Accidia yawned again. Just before I touched the key Accidia added, "You are going to die in the next room. It is the worst of the challenges and those few that survive it go in ready and uninjured. " "I can't go back. Once the trial is started the only way out is at the other end. " "True, true. " Accidia said. "But why go on at all? You could sleep here. I have a bedroom, you wouldn't hunger or feel pain. Your boy could stay with you. If you go on further he will die with you. You are so very weak. " I hadn't seen Willim since I came out of the sitting room. "Willim will remain with or without me. " I said. I turned the key and opened the door, quick to find a point to teleport to if Accidia attacked. But he simply stood and watched me. The balcony was made of the same faded brown stone of the ballroom. A mosaic covered the floor, that of a great black crow with wings unfurled. Beyond the balcony there was only darkness. I stepped out onto the balcony and Accidia followed. "The key, please. " he asked. I handed it back to him then walked to the edge of the balcony. There was a chaotic wind in the emptiness, fierce then suddenly calm in no predictable order, as if angry spirits were trapped in the air. Far below the balcony was a distant maze. Most of it was shrouded in the same darkness as the ceiling and walls of this great chamber, if they existed at all, but creatures wandered through the maze, tormented spirits burning with a purple fire. Some were slow, a creature with a hundred arms dragging itself along. Others moved with purpose, a floating eye burning everything before it, a horned figure leading a pack of demonic hounds. If there was an exit to the maze it was lost in the darkness. "That is the trials last, and most difficult challenge. " Accidia said. "Those demons hunt endlessly for the few mortals willing to enter their lair. " I looked back into the ballroom, there was no sign of Willim. The balcony door was still open, so I hoped that Willim had slipped out, even if I couldn't see him. "Is there a way down?" I asked. "The most promising use magic. " Accidia said, a thin smile momentarily breaking his otherwise impassive face. "A simple task for air, earth or creation mages. A bit more difficult for body or force mages. " [PARAGRAPH:3] A costly spell for dimension mages though. If there was enough energy in my staff I could teleport to any area of the maze I could see. Unfortunately those were only the places that had demons roaming in them. I could throw my staff into the maze and, if it didn't break, it would light up an area. But without my staff I wouldn't be able to teleport to it. "Come rest, dream eternal and you will never know the touch of death. " Accidia said. There was the white glow of candlelight within the maze. Unlike the fiery purple of the demons this figure was small and pale. There were no demons around him and he waved his arms at me. It was Willim. How odd that in this moment, as I stood on the balcony with the demon Accidia, looking down into the infernal maze that I was likely to die in, that I would feel joy. And at the sight of a ghost. But I forced myself to be skeptical. This could be another trap. I looked through the starry eye and examined Willim, what was it that bound him to me? What was our relationship? Then I leaped from the balcony. Accidia returned to the ballroom, locking the door behind him. Maybe he would try harder to stop the next mage that passed through. Maybe he would turn into a giant tusked worm. Even considering the thought tired him, and he shambled back to the sitting room for another nap before he committed himself to anything. I fell through darkness. Teleportation takes more energy the farther you travel. The best way to reduce its cost was to get as close to the point I wanted to teleport to on my own, so I leaped into the emptiness above the maze. I hadn't expected the winds that buffeted me about. One knocked me aside, nearly into the obsidian wall beneath the balcony, and I twisted to keep Willim in sight and my staff securely in hand. My eyes were fixed on Willim, both to provide a target for my spell and because of what my divination spell had revealed. Willim's crooked smile, as he happily waved to me, was gone, replaced by a look of horror. My stomach tightened as I considered the fractions of seconds I had left before I released the spell. Then I was gone. The wind that raged around me was lost, the ground was firmly beneath my feet. I righted myself with my spell and was no longer bound by inertia of my fall. I always did have a flair for dimensional magic. But my spellstaff was dark, the spell had used the last of its magic. "I. . . I thought you fell. " Willim said. "I'm okay. But I have no magic left. We have to escape from this maze without running into any of the demons. Do you know how to get out?" "No. " Willim said. "Then follow me. " William had been standing at a corner with identical hallways going forward and to the left into darkness. Everything was constructed of the same obsidian surface as the wall beneath the balcony. The obsidian was scarred and rough at some points and perfectly smooth at others. These smooth patches acted as black mirrors and reflected corrupted versions of anything before it, or endless inky blackness. As I walked by one I saw myself withered and alone, wearing a drab grey cloak. [PARAGRAPH:3] I walked ahead, assuming the mazes exit would either be in the middle or on the opposite side from the balcony. Both would be in front of me. We walked for hours, the hallway slowly curved and I ignored archways to the right and left. I began to wonder if I had been walking around the maze in circles. I stopped and looked around, but any light coming through the windowed balcony door was blocked by the balcony. There was no indication of direction or distance. Tired of walking straight I turned right at the next intersection. This opened immediately to another passage going right and left or I could continue straight. There was a set of obsidian stairs in the middle of the intersection leading up to just over my head. They didn't lead to anything but empty air. Down the right hallway a purple fire flared against the wall. Its source was out of sight, though it was coming closer. My eyes were adjusted to Willim's pale light but it only revealed a few meters. Now this entire area was cast in reflections of purple and black. Willim and I huddled behind the staircase, afraid to run to either hallway for fear the creature was come around the corner and see us. I could hear the flames and I prayed that whatever was coming would turn and go the other way down the hallway. The purple light faded briefly then went blindingly bright. The roaring flames grew even louder, and in the polished obsidian surface of the far wall I could see the reflection of a great eye spitting wild torrents of purple flame. Waves of purple flame surrounded us as the demon got closer, setting the ground on fire except for a small patch in the staircases shadow. It was so bright I couldn't see the maze walls. Noxious black smoke choked me, and I struggled not to cough. Willim was quivering next to me. I had only the dead spellstaff in my hand. The demon floated up above the staircase and the flames began to slip away as the demon peered down the tunnel before it. Then the demon slipped over the edge of the staircase into the air above us and I could see the cracked fissures that covered the bottom of the giant eye. I held my breath as it passed over us and floated down the hallway. I sat and watched the demon silhouetted by its purple light, urging myself to get up, to run. Finally my stubborn legs obeyed and I ran down the hallway the demon had come from. Willim ran after me. I turned the corner the demon had come from. I had hoped to see an opening to sunlight or elegant double doors, but it was another hallway leading into darkness. I needed to give my eyes time to adjust to Willim's faint light so I slowed to a walk with one hand against the left wall. We walked for a few minutes in silence until I finally spoke. "I checked the relationship between us. " I said, nearly as nervous as I had been when the demon passed over us. "I brought you into the cave with me, you aren't supposed to be here. " Willim didn't answer. He walked beside me with his hands at his side. He looked older then when I had first met him in the skeleton's chamber, perhaps as old as eight. He was just beginning to trade his face's baby fat for the angular curves of boyhood. "I'm pregnant. " I continued. "You will be. . . or you are my son. " He smiled, glancing at me as I struggled to keep my face impassive. "Yes. " he said, "I am with you. " [PARAGRAPH:3] "I wouldn't have entered the trial if I had known. " I said. We walked for hours through the maze. Willim asked about my home and I told him stories of Litha temple, the rosering, the cliffs and beaches of Arune. I told him about my instructor Boann and the bard Garath Per'un, Willim's father. Without any stories of his own Willim was eager to hear all of mine and laughed and asked questions as I told them. We were so absorbed in talking that we nearly ran into the obsidian wall at yet another dead end. We turned and walked back to the last intersection. We both stopped when we heard the plodding footfalls of something huge. I huddled against the wall and signaled for Willim to hide beside me. The thumps stopped and we heard a great intake of breath, like the air being drawn into a massive bellows, followed by an exhale and then a return to silence. There was one step, more noticeable by the vibration in the floor than for its sound, and a giant head loomed into view. The head was dominated by its mouth, which was easily large enough to swallow a barrel whole. A flat nose sat atop it and small black eyes that looked comically undersized compared to the rest of the heads. What was most alarming was the placement of the head, the creature was over twice my height. My brief hope that the head floated on its own, or was attached to some frail thin body were quickly crushed. The giant, which I recognized as a Caducus, stepped into our hallway. His fat naked torso was a cage of flesh, built to contain anyone he swallowed. He would hold them trapped and helpless within his empty torso until he traveled back to hell, where he would barter with the flesh merchants of Dis, the warlords of the Bellobellum, or offer them to Camulos in tribute. He smiled when he saw me. "Run!" I shouted, and I was up and charging toward the Caducus. The only way out of this hallway was by him and I ran toward his left side, switching to his right side at the last moment in the hope that he would be unable to turn in time. He was faster than I expected and his reach made it nearly impossible to stay away from his thick hands. He reached for me and I struck his fingers with my spellstaff. The Caducus roared in pain and gave up his grab for a punch. The blow struck me in the chest and sent me into the hallway wall. Hitting the wall hurt almost as much as the punch and I fell on the ground dizzy from pain. "Run!" This time it was Willim screaming. My vision cleared as I took in the scene before me. The Caducus was holding Willim over his mouth, as I screamed he pushed Willim nearly halfway down his throat and swallowed. I felt a chill go through my body as Willim fell into the Caducus's wide stomach. I charged the Caducus with my spellstaff ready for another strike. But the Caducus was too fast and it caught my waist in one giant hand. It slammed me into a wall, hoping to quiet me long enough to swallow. The blow stunned me, but I regained my focus as he lifted me over his head and I swung my staff, striking the giant's ear. [PARAGRAPH:3] The Caducus roared and his grip loosened enough that I slipped out of his hand and onto his wide shoulders. The Caducus ripped the staff easily from my hands, and I fell against his wide head where one tiny black eye glared at me. The Caducus stumbled back against the maze wall as he tried to grab me. Standing on the creatures shoulder I could see the top of the wall and I leaped for it. The sharp edge of the obsidian wall cut across my stomach and I pulled myself up and rolled onto the top of the wall in blinding pain. But there was no time to rest, the Caducus's giant hands came over the top of the wall and he began to pull himself up after me. I looked for anything to use as a weapon, there was nothing. The darkness of the maze was broken by a small sliver of light in a grove two hallways over. A obsidian archway stood alone, but through it I could see the city of Cevedes. I knew the other side of that portal, it sat above the entrance to the Cave of Ancestors, it was the exit for the trial. The Caducus pulled himself up on the maze wall. Through the gaping holes on his torso I could see Willim, who was still too large to pass through them. Willim was yelling for me, but I couldn't hear what he was saying. A spasm of pain flashed through me, like a hand had reached into my intestines and squeezed. I stumbled toward the Caducus, unwilling to leave Willim, but unable to do anything to stop the giant. My decisions didn't matter as the Caducus was on me. He grabbed my leg and pulled me against him. I kicked helplessly. Held up against his body I reached through one of the gaping holes in his torso. I could see Willim, and feel him as he placed his hands in mine. "You can see the way out. " he said. His hands were so tiny in mine, he seemed to be growing younger. "Yes," I cried "but I can't get there. " "Use magic. " he said. A lucky kick cracked the Caducus's knee. He grabbed my throat with his other hand and squeezed. I looked for Willim through a haze of pain. "The spellstaff is your life. " Willim said, his words growing distant. "Just as I am, use me to cast your spell. " Tears blurred my vision, Willim let go of my hand I lost sight of him as the Caducus shook me again. Satisfied that I was no longer struggling the Caducus held me up to his mouth. I looked around and saw the distant portal light. I searched myself for the life inside me and found it faint and weak. Just as the Caducus stuffed me into his mouth I focused and disappeared. I could hear the Caducus scream as I stumbled through the portal and out onto the ridge overlooking Cevedes. I collapsed there my trial completed, and cried as I felt the life inside me grow cold and still. </Spanish>

		<Italian>Nish stava iniziando quando Lady Kyri irruppe nella stanza con la sua solita furia. Lui guardò a Maelys, un'altro assistente di Lady Kyri, poi si avvicinò a Lady.[NEWLINE]"Lady Kyri, ho buone-"[NEWLINE]"Chi si credono di essere!" lei urlò, interrompendolo. "Loro pensano che questa struttura di ricerca sia uno spreco di soldi! White Mesa è il futuro! Perciò che importanza ha se qualche adepto muore nel corso dei lavori, ce ne sono sempre altri."[NEWLINE]Nish guardò agli altri assistenti, terrore in tutti gli occhi che vedeva. Era in momenti come questo che desiderava aver scelto il tirocinio alla Flesh-Crafters. Almeno lì cercavano di fare le cose in sicurezza. Comunque, lui era il capo assistente.[NEWLINE]"Lady Kyri?"[NEWLINE]"Cosa!" lei scattò.[NEWLINE]"Qualcosa non va?" lui chiese, cercando di controllare la sua voce.[NEWLINE]"Pensano che non stiamo ottenendo risultati! Pensano che siamo troppo costosi! HA! Come se sapessero quale fosse il costo!"[NEWLINE]Si, pensò Nish, qualche adepto è morto. Il problema del Consiglio probabilmente non è quanti adepti muoiono, ma quanti impazziscono e hanno bisogno di qualcuno che se ne prenda cura.[NEWLINE]"Io conosco il prezzo, so che il vero potere è costoso, ma continuo a cercarlo!"[NEWLINE]Si, ma questo perché sei impazzita subito dopo la tua Prova delle Grotte.[NEWLINE]Nish aprì la bocca per parlare, ma Lady Kyri lo interruppe. "Sto andando nelle mie stanze. Che nessuni mi distrurbì."[NEWLINE]Poi si voltò e si precipitò nelle sue stanze. Fuori dalla vista degli assistenti, lasciò le lacrime scorrere, poi prese un piccolo ritratto che aveva. Il ritratto era stato dipinto da un immagine presa dalla sua mente da un mago della mente, e ritraeva un bambino, di circa 10 anni. Mentre guardava il ritratto, lasciò che i ricordi del bambino perso alle Prove gli riempissero la mente, il bambino che ha abortito a causa della tensione, ma che la ha supportata attraverso esse. Mentre ci pensava sentì la sua risolutezza farsi più forte. Quegli adepti possono aver perso il senno, ma la loro perdita non era niente in confronto alla sua. Lei lo sapeva.</Italian>

		<English>A swathe of the Amurite people had gathered, many half-heartedly, into the Council Chambers to witness the inauguration of a new Arch-Chancellor. A young and ambitious mage, Naxus, had been spreading discord and discontent, conniving his way into the rank. He was a war hero, one of the finest mages the Amurite people had ever produced, and unlike many war mages, he was just as capable of writing about the esoteric edges of the sphere of Death as he was calling forth its creatures to strike down the foes of the Amurite nation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It certainly wasn't Naxus' skill with people that had got him there. His smile was convincing enough from a distance, on the rare occasion he forced one onto his lips, but it was easily seen as false upon close inspection, and Naxus much preferred his usual glower. That was the expression he wore now, though a slight smirk occasionally glimmered at the edge, as he accepted the ceremonial wand. He spoke: "Some people are afraid of progress. Like those fools we used to have for leaders, afraid of letting mages truly tap into certain kinds of mana for fear of it. Well, fear of progress will rule the Amurites no longer, because now I rule them instead."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The crowd murmured; his terse acceptance speech was nothing like the intricate, somewhat self-aggrandizing speeches his predecessors had given. It was almost a given that a new Arch-Chancellor would compare themselves to Kylorin and, like clockwork, the Amurites would roll their eyes upon hearing it... but Naxus had not. And it was expected that he would give nothing worse than back-handed compliments to his predecessors; calling them fools was unheard of. Seeing their confused reaction, Naxus said, "I prefer to let my actions speak. If you wish to know why I am worthy, read a history book. Or perhaps you would rather a demonstration?" A few halfhearted claps began as the Amurites gathered realized that not having to sit through three-hour speeches was probably a good thing, tradition be damned.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The demonstration was traditional, but it was normally woven into the speech. Naxus had left it separate; this wasn't unheard of, but only those with the most impressive of skills did so. Naxus said, "I'll need... volunteers. Adepts and apprentices; I can't work with old fools and their superstitions. Only those who feel themselves worthy, and do not fear the unknown, need stand." A handful of the most ambitious stood and went to Naxus. And for the first time off the battlefield, Naxus smiled a true smile; it was the first horror of the day, but hardly the last.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Do not run. If you run, you will die. Do not panic. If you panic, you will die. This is your last chance to leave." A few of the youngest apprentices skittered back to their seats. Naxus waited, inspecting those that remained, then began waving his arms above his head, muttering a spell none had heard. The ambassador to the Scions noticed that his motions were similar to those of the necromancers of the Risen Emperor, though no words of veneration to that man passed through Naxus' lips, so he assumed, correctly, that Naxus was merely imitating the magical components of some Scions spell, no doubt extracted from one of them during their brief war. The rest were mystified.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A foul cloud appeared between his arms, and he whipped it into a whirlwind, consuming himself and the volunteers. Coughing and choking could be heard from within. A few ran out, half-decayed, attempting to scream with rotted throats before falling and dying. Naxus' chanting could still be heard, still utterly calm. A few within the whirlwind began to laugh, while others started ranting like madmen. "No, mother, please, mother, I'm sorry..." "It was an accident! An accident! An accident..." "Why? Why? Why..." One had begun to sing a nursery rhyme, another broke into sobbing. But these soon turned into manic laughter as well, until all within, save the still-chanting Naxus, were either laughing, silent, or decaying outside of the cloud.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At least the cloud began to rise, until it finally disappeared into the aether from which it had been called. The eyes of the surviving volunteers were cold and hollow, and they had a grotesque pallor to their skin, but they were otherwise unharmed. Another wave of Naxus' hand, and his political opponents found a sickly purple glow surrounding them. "Now," Naxus said, "we deal with the traitors..."</English>
		<French>Une partie du peuple amurite s'était assemblée, la plupart avec tiédeur, dans les Chambres du Conseil pour assister à l'investiture du nouvel Archi-Chancelier. Mage jeune et ambitieux, Naxus avait semé le désordre et la discorde, se faufilant jusqu'à ce rang. Il était un héros de guerre, un des plus grands mages que le peuple amurite avait produit, et contrairement à beaucoup de mages de guerre, il était tout autant capable d'écrire sur les frontières ésotériques de la sphère de la Mort, que de faire appel à ses créatures pour terrasser les ennemis de la nation amurite.[PARAGRAPH:1]Ce n'étaient certainement pas les compétences sociales de Naxus qui l'avait mené ici. Son sourire semblait convaincant de loin, quand en de rares occasions il se forçait à en faire un, mais au second coup d'&#156;il, il se révélait facilement faux, et Naxus préférait de loin lancer ses regards noirs habituels. C'était d'ailleurs son expression à ce moment, bien qu'un petit sourire satisfait poigne de temps en temps au bord de ses lèvres, tandis qu'il acceptait la baguette magique cérémonielle. Il s'exprima : "Certains ont peur du progrès. Comme ces idiots que nous avions comme chefs, inquiets à l'idée de laisser les mages utiliser réellement certaines sources du mana, par peur d'elles. Eh bien, la peur du progrès ne guidera plus les Amurites, car je les dirigerai à sa place."[PARAGRAPH:1]La foule murmurait ; son discours simple ne ressemblait en rien à ceux complexes et quelque peu gargarisants de ses prédécesseurs. Il était presque sûr qu'un nouvel Archi-Chancelier se comparerait à Kylorin, et comme un papier à musique, les Amurites lèveraient les yeux au ciel en entendant cela... mais pas Naxus. Et on s'attendait à ce qu'il ne fasse rien de pire que des compliments ambigüs à ses prédécesseurs ; les traiter d'idiots n'était pas prévu. Voyant la confusion s'installer, Naxus dit, "Je préfère laisser mes actions parler d'elles-mêmes. Si vous souhaitez savoir pourquoi je le mérite, lisez un livre d'histoire. Ou peut-être préféreriez-vous une démonstration ?" Quelques applaudissements mitigés retentirent tandis que les Amurites rassemblés se rendaient compte que ne pas rester assis à écouter un discours de trois heures était probablement une bonne chose, et au diable la tradition.[PARAGRAPH:1]La démonstration était traditionnelle, mais normalement incluse dans le discours. Naxus l'avait laissée à part ; ce n'était pas la première fois que l'on procédait ainsi, mais seuls les plus talentueux s'y risquaient. Naxus dit, "j'aurais besoin de... volontaires. Adeptes et apprentis ; je ne peux pas travailler avec de vieux fous emplis de superstition. Que ceux qui s'en pensent dignes et n'ont pas peur de l'inconnu se lèvent." Une poignée des plus ambitieux se levèrent et allèrent vers Naxus. Et pour la première fois hors du champ de bataille, Naxus sourit sincèrement; ce fut la première chose horrible de la journée, mais certainement pas la dernière.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ne fuyez pas. Si vous fuyez, vous mourrez. Ne paniquez pas. Si vous paniquez, vous mourrez. C'est votre dernière chance de partir." Quelques-uns des plus jeunes apprentis reculèrent jusqu'à leurs sièges. Naxus attendit, inspectant ceux qui restaient, puis se mit à agiter les bras au-dessus de sa tête, murmurant un sort que nul n'avait jamais entendu. L'ambassadeur des Scions nota que ses mouvements ressemblaient à ceux des nécromanciens de l'Empereur Ranimé, même si aucune vénération envers cet homme ne sortit des lèvres de Naxus. Il supposa donc, avec raison, que Naxus imitait simplement les composantes magiques de certains sorts scions, certainement obtenus de force de l'un d'eux durant leur courte guerre. Les autres étaient mystifiés.[PARAGRAPH:1]Un nuage infect apparut entre ses bras, et il le fit tourbillonner, le recouvrant ainsi que ses volontaires. Des toux et des suffocations s'entendaient depuis l'intérieur. Quelques-uns sortirent, à moitié décomposés, tentant de crier à travers leurs gorges pourries avant de s'effondrer et mourir. On pouvait toujours entendre le chant de Naxus, totalement calme. Certains à l'intérieur du tourbillon se mirent à rire, tandis que d'autres commençaient à déclamer comme des fous. "Non, mère, s'il te plait, mère, je suis désolé..." "C'était un accident ! C'était un accident ! Un accident !" "Pourquoi ? Pourquoi ? Pourquoi ?" L'un d'entre eux se mit à chanter une comptine, un autre éclata en sanglots. Mais ils se mirent bientôt à rire comme des fous jusqu'à ce que tous sauf Naxus (toujours chantant) soient en train de rire, silencieux, ou en train de pourrir hors du nuage.[PARAGRAPH:1]Enfin le nuage s'éleva, jusqu'à disparaître dans l'éther d'où il était venu. Les yeux des volontaires survivants étaient froids et vides, et leurs peaux étaient d'une pâleur grotesque, mais ils semblaient autrement sains et saufs. Un autre mouvement de la main de Naxus, et ses opposants politiques se virent entourés de flammes violettes malsaines. "Maintenant," dit Naxus, "occupons-nous des traîtres..."</French>

		<Italian>Una folla di Amurite si era riunita, molti a malincuore, nelle Sale del Consiglio per assistere all'inaugurazione del nuovo Arci-Cancelliere. Un giovane e ambizioso mago, Naxus, che aveva diffuso discordia e malcontento, usando metodi discutibili per raggiungere tale carica. Era un eroe di guerra, uno dei migliori maghi che il popolo degli Amurite aveva mai prodotto, e diversamente da molti maghi da guerra, lui era capace di scrivere trattati riguardo i lati esoterici della sfera della Morte quanto di usare le creature che evocava per eliminare i nemici della nazione degli Amurite.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Di sicuro non era stata l'abilità di Naxus ad avere a che fare con le persone ad averlo portato fin li. Il suo sorriso poteva essere sufficentemente convincente dalla distanza, nelle rare occasione in cui ne forzava uno, ma si vedeva facilmente che fosse finto ad un'analisi più attenta, e Naxus preferiva di gran lunga usare il suo sguardo torvo. Quella era l'espressione che stava usando ora, sebbene un sogghigno veniva occasionalmente accennato, mentre accettava la bacchetta magica cerimoniale. Parlò: "Alcune persone hanno paura del progresso. Come quegli stupidi che avevamo come guide, troppo timorosi per permettere ai maghi di approffondire veramente alcuni tipi di mana. Ora la paura del progresso non governerà più gli Amurites, perché ora sono io ha governarli."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La folla mormorò; il suo discorso di presentazione era conciso e non intricato, e a volte auto referenziale, come quelli fatti dai suoi predecessori. Era quasi un dato di fatto che un nuovo Arci Cancelliere si paragonava a Kylorin e, come un meccaniscmo ad orologeria, gli Amurite avrebberò girato gli occhi sentendo ciò... ma Naxus non lo fece. Ci si aspettava inoltre che non si sarebbe andati oltre a dei complimenti a doppio senso riguardo i suoi predecessori; chimarli stupidi era inaudito. Vedendo le loro reazioni confuse, Naxus disse, "Preferisco lasciar parlare le mie azioni. Se volete sapere perché sono degno leggete un libro di storia. O magari volete vedere una dimostrazione?" Ci fu qualche applauso poco convinto quando gli Amurite presenti realizzarono che non dover stare seduti per tre ore di discorso era probabilmente una cosa positiva, al diavolo la tradizione.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]La dimostrazione era un'altra tradizione, ma veniva fatta durante il discorso di norma. Naxus le aveva divise; non era una cosa cosi inconsueta, ma solo chi aveva capacità fenomenali lo faceva. Naxus disse, "Ho bisogno di... volontari. Adepti e apprendisti; non posso lavorare con vecchi pazzi e le loro superstizioni. Solo coloro che si sentono degni, e che non temono l'ignoto, devono restare". Una manciata dei più ambiziosi si alzò e andarono da Naxus. E per la prima volta che era lontano dal campo di battaglia, Naxus sorrise con sincerità; era il primo orrore del giorno, ma difficilmente l'ultimo.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Non scappate. Se scappate, morirete. Non fatevi prendere dal panico. Se vi fate prendere dal panico, morirete. Questa è la vostra ultima possibilità per andarvene." Alcuni degli apprendisti più giovani tornarono ai loro posti. Naxus attese, ispezionando quelli che erano rimasti, poi iniziò ad agitare le braccia sopra la sua testa, borbottando una magia che nessuno aveva mai sentito. L'ambasciatore degli Scions notò che i suoi movimenti erano simili a quelli dei necromanti dell'Imperatore Risorto, sebbene nessuna parola di venerazione per quell'uomo passò dalle labbra di Naxus, cosi ipotizzò, correttamente, che Naxus stava semplicemente imitando le componenti magiche di qualche magia Scions, senza alcun dubbio strappata a uno dei loro durante la loro breve guerra. Il resto era solo un imbroglio.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Una nube nera apparve tra le sue braccia, e lui la trasformò in un vortice, avvolgendo se stesso e i volontari. All'interno della nube si sentiva qualcuno tossiere e qualcuno soffocare. Alcuni corserò fuori, mezzo decomposti, cercando di urlare attraverso le loro gole ormai marce prima di cadere a terra e morire. Si sentiva ancora Naxus parlare, ancora completamente calmo. Qualcuno all'interno del vortice iniziò a ridere, mentre altri iniziarono ad inveire come matti. "No, madre, per favore, madre, mi dispiace..." "È stato un'incidente! Un'incidente! Un'incidente..." "Perché? Perché? Perché..." Uno iniziò a cantare una filastrocca, un'altro a piangere. Ma presto anche questi iniziarono a ridere in maniera maniacale, fino a quando tutti all'interno, tranne Naxus che continuava a parlare, stavano ridendo, rimanendo in silenzio, o decomponendosi fuori dalla nube.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]alla fine la nube iniziò a diradarsi, fino a scomparire nell'etere da cui era stata chiamata. Gli occhi dei volontari rimasti erano freddi e vuoti, e avevano la pella gtottescamente pallida, ma per il resto erano illesi. Un'altro cenno della mano di Naxus, e i suoi oppositori politici si trovarono circondati da un bagliore violaceo malsano. "Ora," Naxus disee, "ci occupiamo dei traditori..."</Italian>
		<Spanish>A swathe of the Amurite people had gathered, many half-heartedly, into the Council Chambers to witness the inauguration of a new Arch-Chancellor. A young and ambitious mage, Naxus, had been spreading discord and discontent, conniving his way into the rank. He was a war hero, one of the finest mages the Amurite people had ever produced, and unlike many war mages, he was just as capable of writing about the esoteric edges of the sphere of Death as he was calling forth its creatures to strike down the foes of the Amurite nation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It certainly wasn't Naxus' skill with people that had got him there. His smile was convincing enough from a distance, on the rare occasion he forced one onto his lips, but it was easily seen as false upon close inspection, and Naxus much preferred his usual glower. That was the expression he wore now, though a slight smirk occasionally glimmered at the edge, as he accepted the ceremonial wand. He spoke: "Some people are afraid of progress. Like those fools we used to have for leaders, afraid of letting mages truly tap into certain kinds of mana for fear of it. Well, fear of progress will rule the Amurites no longer, because now I rule them instead."[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The crowd murmured; his terse acceptance speech was nothing like the intricate, somewhat self-aggrandizing speeches his predecessors had given. It was almost a given that a new Arch-Chancellor would compare themselves to Kylorin and, like clockwork, the Amurites would roll their eyes upon hearing it... but Naxus had not. And it was expected that he would give nothing worse than back-handed compliments to his predecessors; calling them fools was unheard of. Seeing their confused reaction, Naxus said, "I prefer to let my actions speak. If you wish to know why I am worthy, read a history book. Or perhaps you would rather a demonstration?" A few halfhearted claps began as the Amurites gathered realized that not having to sit through three-hour speeches was probably a good thing, tradition be damned.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The demonstration was traditional, but it was normally woven into the speech. Naxus had left it separate; this wasn't unheard of, but only those with the most impressive of skills did so. Naxus said, "I'll need... volunteers. Adepts and apprentices; I can't work with old fools and their superstitions. Only those who feel themselves worthy, and do not fear the unknown, need stand." A handful of the most ambitious stood and went to Naxus. And for the first time off the battlefield, Naxus smiled a true smile; it was the first horror of the day, but hardly the last.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Do not run. If you run, you will die. Do not panic. If you panic, you will die. This is your last chance to leave." A few of the youngest apprentices skittered back to their seats. Naxus waited, inspecting those that remained, then began waving his arms above his head, muttering a spell none had heard. The ambassador to the Scions noticed that his motions were similar to those of the necromancers of the Risen Emperor, though no words of veneration to that man passed through Naxus' lips, so he assumed, correctly, that Naxus was merely imitating the magical components of some Scions spell, no doubt extracted from one of them during their brief war. The rest were mystified.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A foul cloud appeared between his arms, and he whipped it into a whirlwind, consuming himself and the volunteers. Coughing and choking could be heard from within. A few ran out, half-decayed, attempting to scream with rotted throats before falling and dying. Naxus' chanting could still be heard, still utterly calm. A few within the whirlwind began to laugh, while others started ranting like madmen. "No, mother, please, mother, I'm sorry..." "It was an accident! An accident! An accident..." "Why? Why? Why..." One had begun to sing a nursery rhyme, another broke into sobbing. But these soon turned into manic laughter as well, until all within, save the still-chanting Naxus, were either laughing, silent, or decaying outside of the cloud.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At least the cloud began to rise, until it finally disappeared into the aether from which it had been called. The eyes of the surviving volunteers were cold and hollow, and they had a grotesque pallor to their skin, but they were otherwise unharmed. Another wave of Naxus' hand, and his political opponents found a sickly purple glow surrounding them. "Now," Naxus said, "we deal with the traitors..."</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]"Is it done?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Sammuel offered only a painted shell as proof. He wasn't the most talented of Valledia's wizards, but skilled enough in the magic of the mind and soul to do what was required, and particularly unhindered by morals that can conflict with such a task. [PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia nodded and excused the wizard from the chamber, he bowed and slunk out, seeming a jackal to her eyes. But she was no better, her hands were just as bloody for ordering him to the task as he was for completing it. [PARAGRAPH:1]She sat and considered this while she waited for the Caswallawn to arrive. He was ever late, and as undisciplined as he was talented. When finally he arrived he was rushed, as people who cannot keep time always are. [PARAGRAPH:1]"You have released Sammuel from the prisons? He was convicted of unapproved necromancy, of sustaining a creature's life past natural means!" [PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia didn't answer. [PARAGRAPH:1]"He should have been killed for his experimentation, there is no balance in what he was doing, he threatens to incur the wrath of the gods on all of us. First you order him spared, now you let him go. What were you thinking?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"Incur the wrath of the gods?" [PARAGRAPH:1]She knew Dain wasn't religious, he had been listening to the priests ramble on. He started again. [PARAGRAPH:1]"He broke the law, why shouldn't it apply to him? What is special about this man that he should flaunt our restrictions while others are punished justly for them?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"His life is mine to give or take, as is your counsel. Go on to other topics, you won't receive anything that will satisfy you with this one."[PARAGRAPH:1]Dain began to argue back, but he sensed a gravity in her that he didn't understand. She wouldn't be moved on this matter, and Valledia had her reasons even if she wouldn't share them. She was as stubborn and logical a creature as he had ever met. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Fine, to this truce then. The priests say that the Elohim are withdrawing from their war with the Infernals." [PARAGRAPH:1]"And?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"The Infernals are not as weak as some suppose, if they are agreeing to peace with the Elohim then it is only because they wish to carry on battle somewhere else. The Elohim are a powerful force and they must see easier targets to feed upon, the Bannor, the Lanun or us." [PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia waited to see if he would continue with his logic, but for all of his arcane skill he had a disappointing inability to anticipate the future. [PARAGRAPH:1]"The priests are right, at least on this, the Elohim have already agreed to peace. What would you have me do about it?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"We need to go to Cahir Abbey and meet with Einion, to talk him into resuming this war." [PARAGRAPH:1]"Do you think that we could convince Einion to go back on his word? To forfeit a signed deal because if he doesn't sacrifice Elohim lives we might have to sacrifice Amurite ones? Or do you think that even attempting to do that will not only fail but draw the Infernals wrath at our attempt, and we will have the war you fear so much."[PARAGRAPH:1]Dain began pacing. Although shortsighted at times he was an Amurite and once presented with a logical argument he would consider it carefully. He reached out to a burning brazier that hung in the chamber and his finger cut the smoke into twin plumes. At Dain's silent command the smoke gathered and formed itself into two images, one of Hyborem and the other of Einion. He studied both of them, looking for some sign of their nature in the fabricated images. He spoke slowly as he thought through each statement, trying to see if there was anyway to work around it and finding himself trapped by them. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Einion won't break his truce. Hyborem will attack another civilization. If that civilization is us, we will likely die. Do we have something Hyborem wants, something we could trade for peace if we needed it?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"What would a demon want except to kill?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"Is there a reason you suspect that he will attack the Lanun or the Bannor instead of us?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"No, like most predators he will go after the weakest of his targets, that is us. Ready your wizards for war, it will come to us. Slip the firebows from the coastal borders to those we share with the Infernals." [PARAGRAPH:1]Dain nodded, understanding the situation. Understanding that diplomacy was lost, he turned his mind to war. [PARAGRAPH:1]"I will begin to train adepts to sanctify the land, no doubt we will be facing the taint. We may want to consider a show of support for the Order, they could be strong allies soon. [PARAGRAPH:1]"You are right, I will handle the Order, stay to your mages." [PARAGRAPH:1]"I should go, I have much to do."[PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia nodded and Dain turned to leave. She stopped him before he left the chamber. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Dain, I have foreseen this war and moved to save us from it. Though the night will be long, morning will come. The Elohim will rejoin the war, as they have borne a great enmity against the Infernals and wont be able to watch us fall to them. When the Infernals have taken our border cities and march toward our capitals we will go to them, talk of those we have lost, and they will break their truce and join us." [PARAGRAPH:1]"They bear no love for us. Their hated for the Infernals must be greater than I imagined." [PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia only nodded.</English>
		<French>"C'est fait ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Sammuel n'offrit qu'un petit coquillage peint en guise de preuve. Il n'était pas le magicien le plus talentueux de Valledia, mais il était suffisamment doué dans les magies des pensées et de l'âme pour faire ce qui est nécessaire, et surtout pas bloqué par des considérations morales qui pourraient interférer avec des telles tâches.[PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia hocha la tête et congédia le magicien de la chambre. Il fit une révérence et se retira, tandis qu'il lui faisait horreur. Mais elle n'était pas mieux lotie, ses mains étant autant couvertes de sang pour lui avoir confié cette mission que lui pour l'avoir réalisée.[PARAGRAPH:1]Elle s'assit et réfléchit à tout ceci en attendant l'arrivée du Cassibellan. Il était toujours en retard, aussi indiscipliné qu'il était talentueux. Quand il arriva finalement, il était pressé, comme tous ceux qui n'arrivent pas à gérer leur temps.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Vous avez libéré Sammuel des geôles ? Il avait été jugé coupable de nécromancie interdite, de maintien en vie d'une créature au-delà du naturel !"[PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia ne répondit pas.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Il aurait dû être exécuté pour ses expériences. Il n'y avait pas d'équilibre dans ce qu'il faisait, il menaçait d'attirer sur nous tous la colère des dieux. D'abord vous ordonnez qu'on l'épargne, et maintenant vous le libérez. À quoi pensiez-vous ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Encourir la colère des dieux ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Elle savait que Dain était athée, il avait écouter les prêtres parler pour ne rien dire. Il recommença.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Il a enfreint la loi, pourquoi ne devrait-elle pas s'appliquer à lui ? Qu'y a-t-il de spécial chez cet homme qu'il puisse ignorer nos restrictions alors que les autres sont justement châtiés à cause d'elles ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sa vie ou sa mort est entre mes mains, de même que voter défenseur. Changez de sujet, vous n'obtiendrez rien de satisfaisant avec celui-ci."[PARAGRAPH:1]Dain commença à contre-argumenta, mais il sentait en elle une gravité qu'il ne comprenait pas. Elle ne changerait pas d'avis sur la question, et Valledia avait ses raisons même si elle ne souhaitait pas lui en faire part. Elle était la créature la plus têtue et logique qu'il avait jamais rencontrée.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Bien, faisons donc une trêve. Les prêtres disent que les Elohims se replient de leur guerre conter les Infernaux."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Et ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Les Infernaux ne sont pas si faibles que certains le pensent. S'ils font la paix avec les Elohims c'est uniquement parce qu'ils souhaitent porter la guerre ailleurs. Les Elohims sont une force puissante et ils doivent chercher des cibles plus faibles dont se repaître, les Bannors, les Lanuns ou nous."[PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia attendit pour voir s'il continuerait avec sa logique, mais malgré tous ses talents arcaniques il avait une incapacité décevante à anticiper l'avenir.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Les prêtres ont raison, au moins sur ce point. Les Elohims ont déjà accepté la paix. Que voudriez-vous que j'y fasse ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Nous devons aller à Abbaye Cahir et rencontrer Einion, pour le convaincre de reprendre les combats."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Vous pensez qu'on peut convaincre Einion de manquer à sa parole ? D'annuler un pacte signé parce que s'il ne sacrifie pas des vies elohims nous pourrions devoir en sacrifier des amurites ? Ou pensez-vous que rien que tenter ça ne ferait qu'attirer la colère des Infernaux sur nous, et nous subirons cette guerre que vous craignez tant."[PARAGRAPH:1]Dain commença à faire les cent pas. Bien que parfois incapable de voir à long terme, il était un Amurite, et une fois qu'on lui présente un argument logique il l'examine soigneusement. Il s'approcha d'un brasero brûlant suspendu dans la chambre et son doigt coupa la fumée en deux plumes jumelles. Sur l'ordre silencieux de Dain, la fumée se rassembla et prit la forme de deux images, une d'Hyborem et l'autre d'Einion. Il les étudia tous les deux, cherchant un indice sur leur nature dans les images fabriquées. Il parla lentement, comme s'il analysait chaque mot, cherchant si quelque chose se cacahit autour et cherchait à le piéger avec.[PARAGRAPh:1]"Einion ne rompra pas la trêve. Hyborem attaquera une auter civilisation. Si nous sommes cette civilisation, nous mourrons sûrement. Avons(nous quoi que ce soit que veut Hyborem, quelque chose que nous pourrions échanger contre une apix en cas de besoin ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Que voudrait d'autre un démon si ce n'est tuer ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Y a-t-il une raison pour que vous pensiez qu'il attaquera les Lanuns ou les Bannors plutôt que nous ?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Non, comme la plupart des prédateurs il s'attaquera à la plus faible de ses proies, nous. Préparez vos magiciens à la guerre, elle nous arrive dessus. Redéployez les Archers de Feu des frontières côtières vers celles que nous partageons avec les Infernaux."[PARAGRAPH:1]Dain acquiesça, comprenant la situation. Comprenant que la diplomatie avait échoué, son esprit passa en mode guerrier.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Je commencerai à apprendre aux Adeptes à Sanctifier la terre, nous ferons sûrement face à la corruption. Nous pourrions faire une démonstration de support envers l'Ordre, ils pourraient faire de puissants alliés sous peu.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Vous avez raison, je me charge de l'Ordre. Restez avec vos mages."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Je devrais y aller, j'ai beaucoup à faire."[PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia hocha la tête et Dain se tourna pour partir. Elle l'arrêta avant qu'il quitte la chambre.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Dain, j'avais prévu cette guerre et agi pour nous en préserver. Même si la nuit sera longue, l'aube viendra. Les Elohims se joidront à la guerre, étant donné qu'ils conservent une forte hostilité envers les Infernaux et ne seront pas capables de nous regarder leur succomber. Quand les Infernaux auront pris nos villes frontalières et marcheront sur notre capitales, nous irons les voir, parler de ceux que nous aurons perdus, et ils rompront la trêve pour se joindre à nous."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ils ne nous montrent aucune once d'amitié. Leur haine des Infernaux doit être plus grande que ce que j'imaginais."[PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia acquiesça seulement.</French>
		<German>[TAB]"Ist es vollbracht?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Sammuel führte einzig eine bemalte Muschel als Beweis an. Zwar war er nicht der talentierteste von Valledia's Zauberern, doch waren seine Künste der Gedanken und der Seelenmagie derart ausgebaut das er zu einer echten Gefahr werden konnte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia nickte und entließ den Zauberer aus dem Raum, er verbeugte sich und begab sich hinaus, ähnlich dem Jackal in ihren Augen. Doch sie war keinen deut besser als der Zauberer. An ihren Händen klebte genau so viel Blut wie an den Händen des Magiers, denn sie ausschickte, die Aufgabe zu erfüllen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sie saß da und betrachtete es während sie auf die Ankunft des Caswallawn wartete. Er war schon immer spät gewesen und genau  so undiszipliniert wie talentiert. Als er schließlich eingetroffen war, hetzte er, er hetzte so wie es Leute taten, die niemals unnötige Zeit an einem Ort zubrachten.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ihr habt Sammuel aus der Gefangenschaft entlassen? Er wurde der ungebilligten Nekromantie überführt, als er das Leben einer Kreatur verlängerte!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia antwortete nicht.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Er sollte für seine Experimente hingerichtet werden, es gibt einfach keine Rechtfertigung für seine Taten. Er lenkt den Zorn der Götter auf alle von uns. Zunächst lässt du ihn festnehmen, nun lässt du ihn laufen? Was denkst du dir dabei?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Den Zorn der Götter heraufzubeschwören?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Sie wusste dass er nicht Religiös war, er hatte einzig den Priestern zugehört. Er fing wieder an.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Er brach das Gesetz, weshalb sollte es ihn tolerieren? Was macht diesen Mann so besonders, als das er sich unseren Bestimmungen entzieht, während andere dafür bestraft werden?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Sein Leben gehört mir, es liegt allein in meiner Obhut, ihn Leben oder Sterben zu lassen. Befasst euch mit anderen Dingen, denn hier werdet ihr nichts erreichen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dain begann zwar zurück zu argumentieren, doch spürte er eine Gravitation, ein episches etwas in ihr, ein Gefühl welches er sich nicht erklären konnte. Sie würde sich nicht abringen lassen nicht in dieser Angelegenheit, sie hatte ihre Gründe selbst wenn sie diese nicht offen legen wollte. Sie war die dickköpfigste und logischste Kreatur die er jemals getroffen hatte.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Gut nun zu diesem Waffenstillstand. Die Priester sagen dass die Elohim vom Kampf gegen die Infernalen zurücktreten."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Und?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Die Infernalen sind nicht so schwach wie manche Leute behaupten, falls sie einem Frieden mit den Elohim zustimmen, dann nur um den Kampf an andere Stelle zu tragen. Die Elohim sind eine mächtige Macht und sie müssen einfachere Ziele finden, wie die Bannor, die Lanun oder uns."[PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia wartete um zu sehen ob er mit dieser Logik fortfahren würde, doch zu seinen minderen magischen Fähigkeiten gehörte leider auch eine enttäuschende Unfähigkeit die Zukunft vorherzusehen.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Wir müssen uns in nach Cahir Abbey, in die Geweihte Stadt, begeben und dort mit Einion über die Wiederaufnahme des Krieges reden." [PARAGRAPH:1]"Denkst du das wir, Enion davon überzeugen können zurück zu seinem Wort zu finden? Einen Unterschriebenen Vertrag zu verwerfen, nur weil er keine Elohim opfern will und die Amurite vielleicht ein paar ihrer Leben? Oder denkst du dass sogar der Versuch dies zu tun, zwar nicht zwangsläufig fehlschlagen doch die Infernalen auf dich Aufmerksam machen wird und wir haben den so von dir gefürchteten Krieg bei uns?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Dain begann davon zu schreiten. Obgleich er doch manchmal etwas kurzsichtig war, war er ein Amurite und sobald ein logisches Argument vorgebracht ist wird er es vorsichtig betrachten. Er erreichte einen brennenden Messingarbeiter welcher im Raum hing, seine Finger formten aus dem Rauch zwei kleine Federn. Auf Dain's leises Kommando hin, vereinte sich der Rauch und formte sich zu zwei Bildern. Eines nahm die Form Hyborems und das andere die Form Einions an. Er Studierte beide sehr innig, versuchte Zeichen ihrer Natur in ihren verrauchten Bildern zu erkennen. Er sprach so langsam wie er dachte, ging jede Aussage in Gedanken durch, im Versuch einen weg um diese herum zu finden und sich selbst dabei zu ertappen.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Einion wird seinen Waffenstillstand nicht brechen. Hyborem wird eine andere Zivilisation angreifen. Falls wir diese Zivilisation sind werden wir am besten alle Sterben. Falls wir etwas haben nach dem es Hyborem dürstet, könnten wir es dann im Austausch gegen Frieden anbieten?[PARAGRAPH:1]"Was würde ein Dämon verlangen außer das Töten?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Gibt es einen Grund anzunehmen, das er lieber die Lanun oder die Bannor angreifen wird, anstatt uns?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Keiner und sogar die Annahme das er nach dem Schwächsten seiner Ziele geht steht gegen uns denn das sind wir. Bereite deine Zauberer auf Krieg vor, er wird kommen, er wird zu uns kommen. verlagert die Feuerbögen von der Küstenlinie zu dem Grenzabschnitt den wir uns mit den Infernalen Teilen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Dain nickte und verstand die Situation, verstand das die Diplomatie verloren war, er bereitete seinen Geist auf Krieg vor.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich werde damit beginnen Adepten im Verändern des Landes zu Schulen, Ohne Zweifel werden wir das Land verändern. Wir dürfen uns als eine Hilfe für die Weisung betrachten. Sie können bald zu starken verbündeten werden.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ihr habt recht, ich werde dafür sorgen das die Weisung zu euren Magiern steht."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Ich sollte nun gehen, ich habe viel zu tun."[PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia nickte und Dain wollte gerade gehen, als sie ihn stoppte, kurz bevor er den Raum verließ.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Dain, ich habe diesen Krieg vorhergesehen und alles getan uns vor ihm zu beschützen. Die Nacht wird lange, sehr lange sein, doch der Tag wird kommen. Die Elohim werden den Kampf gegen die Infernalen wiederaufnehmen, sobald ihnen eine große Eminenz im Kampf gegen die Infernalen geboren wurde. Sie werden nicht in der Lage sein zuzusehen wie wir an die Infernalen fallen. Spätestens wenn unsere Grenzstädte und vielleicht unsere Hauptstadt gefallen sind, werden wir zu ihnen gehen, wir werden ihnen sagen dass wir verloren haben und sie werden ihren Frieden mit den Infernalen brechen und uns beistehen.[PARAGRAPH:1]Sie hegen keine Liebe für uns. Doch ihr Hass, ihr Hass auf die Infernalische Brut, muss größer sein als ich es mir vorstellte.[PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia Nickte nur.</German>
		<Italian>[TAB]"Finito?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Sammuel offrì solamente un involucro dipinto come prova. Non era lo stregone più abile tra quelli di Valledia, ma abile abbastanza nella magia della mente e dello spirito per fare ciò che era richiesto, e con una morale che non sarebbe entrata in conflitto con il compito assegnatogli. [PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia annuì e congedò lo stregone, lui si chinò e sgattaiolo via, sembrando uno sciacallo agli occhi di lei. Ma lei non era migliore, lei era colpevole quanto lui per quel compito che lei aveva ordinato e che lui avrebbe compiuto. [PARAGRAPH:1]Lei sedette e rifletté su ciò mentre aspettava che il Caswallawn arrivvasse. Lui era sempre in ritardo, e talentuoso quanto indisciplinato. Infine lui arrivò correndo, come tutte le persone che non riescono a tener conto dell'ora. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Hai fatto rilasciare Sammuel dalle prigioni? Era in arresto per uso della necormanzia non autorizzato, di aver sostenuto la vita di una creatura oltre i limiti naturali!" [PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia non rispose. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Si sarebbe dovuto ucciderlo per i suoi esperimenti, non c'era equilibrio in quello che faceva, rischiava di attirare l'ira degli dei su tutti noi. Prima ordini che venga graziato, ora lo lascia andare via. Cosa stavi pensando?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"Attirare l'ira degli dei?" [PARAGRAPH:1]Lei sapeva che Dain non era religioso, doveva aver ascoltato qualche prete divagare. Lui ricominciò da capo. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Ha infranto la legge, perché non si dovrebbe apllicare a lui? Cosa ha di speciale quest'uomo che può ignorare le nostre restrizioni quando chiunque altro viene punito giustamente se non le rispettano?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"Io decido se prendere o no la sua vita, cosi come i tuoi consigli. Parliamo d'altro, non riceverai risposte che ti soddisfino su questo argomento."[PARAGRAPH:1]Dain incominciò a ribattere, ma sentiva una solennità nella sua voce che non capiva. Non avrebbe cambiato idea su questo argomento, e Valledia aveva le sue ragioni, anche se non le condivideva. Lei era la creatura più logica e testarda che lui avesse mai incontrato. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Bene, tregua allora. I preti dicono che gli Elohim si stanno ritirado dalla guerra con gli Infernali." [PARAGRAPH:1]"E?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"Gli Infernali non sono deboli come alcuni pensavano, se stanno accettando di fare pace con gli Elohim then è solo perché desiderano spostare la loro attenzione da qualche altra parte. Gli Elohim sono molto forti e loro devono vedere prede più facili da colpire, i Bannor, i Lanun o noi." [PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia attese per vedere se continuava con il suo ragionamento, nonostante tutte le sue capacità magiche lui aveva una deludente incapacità di prevedere il futuro. [PARAGRAPH:1]"I preti hanno ragione, almeno su questo, gli Elohim hanno già firmato la pace. Cosa vorresti che facessi al riguardo?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"Dobbiamo andare a Cahir Abbey e incontrare Einion, per convincerlo a riprendere la guerra." [PARAGRAPH:1]"Pensi che riusciremmo a convincere Einion a rimangiarsi la parola data? Di infrangere un'accordo firmato perché se lui non sacrifica vite Elohim noi potremmo dover sacrificarne di Amurite? Hai pensato che magari, oltre a fallire, questo nostro tentativo potrebbe attirare l'ira degli Infernali su di noi, e noi avremmo la guerra che tu temi tanto."[PARAGRAPH:1]Dain iniziò a camminare nella stanza. Anche se non era lungimirante qualche volta era comunque un Amurite e una volta presentato un'argomento logico lo analizzava attentamente. Allungò una mano verso un braciere acceso che era appeso nella camera e il suo dito divise il fumo in due colonne. Seguendo il silenzioso comando di Dain il fumo prese le sembianze di due figure, una di Hyborem e l'altra di Einion. Studiò entrambe, alla ricerca di qualche segno della loro natura in quelle immagini. Parlò lentamente mentre pensava ad ogni affermazione, cercando di capire se c'era comunque un modo per aggirare il problema ma non trovandone. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Einion non romperarà la tregua. Hyborem attaccherà un'altra civiltà. Se quella civiltà siamo noi, molto probabilmente moriremo. Abbiamo qualcosa che Hyborem vuole, qualcosa che possiamo offrire in cambio della pace se necessario?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Che cosa vorrebbe un demone oltre a uccidere?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"C'è una ragione per cui sospetti che lui attaccherà i Lanun o i Bannor invece di noi?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"No, come la ggior parte dei predatori andrà per la preda più debole, che siamo noi. Prepara i tuoi stregoni per la guerra, arriverà da noi. Sposta gli Archi di Fuoco dalla costa ai confini che abbiamo con gli Infernali". [PARAGRAPH:1]Dain annuì, comprendendo la situazione. Capendo che la diplomazia era ormai inutile, iniziò a pensare alla guerra. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Iniziaerò ad addestrare gli adepti a consacrare la terra, senza dubbio dovremmo aver a che fare con la corruzione. Potremmo considerare una dimostrazione di supporto all'Ordine, potrebberò essere dei potenti alleati a breve. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Hai ragione, io mi occuperò dell'Ordine, tu occupati dei tuoi maghi". [PARAGRAPH:1]"Devo andare, ho molto da fare."[PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia annuì e Dain si voltò per andarsene. Lei lo fermò prima che lui abbandonasse la stanza. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Dain, ho previsto questa guerra è ho agito per salvarci da essa. Sebbene la notte sarà lunga, l'alba arriverà. Gli Elohim rientreranno in guerra, avendo sviluppato una grande ostilità verso gli Infernali e non riusciranno a restare fermi a guardare mentre veniamo eliminati. Quando gli Infernali avranno preso le nostre città al confine e marceranno verso la nostra capitale andremmo da loro, parleremo di coloro che abbiamo perso, e loro romperanno la rtegua e si uniranno a noi". [PARAGRAPH:1]"Loro non provano niente per noi. Il loro odio per gli Infernali dev'essere più grande di quanto immaginavo". [PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia annuì soltanto.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[TAB]"Is it done?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Sammuel offered only a painted shell as proof. He wasn't the most talented of Valledia's wizards, but skilled enough in the magic of the mind and soul to do what was required, and particularly unhindered by morals that can conflict with such a task. [PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia nodded and excused the wizard from the chamber, he bowed and slunk out, seeming a jackal to her eyes. But she was no better, her hands were just as bloody for ordering him to the task as he was for completing it. [PARAGRAPH:1]She sat and considered this while she waited for the Caswallawn to arrive.

First you order him spared, now you let him go. What were you thinking?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"Incur the wrath of the gods?" [PARAGRAPH:1]She knew Dain wasn't religious, he had been listening to the priests ramble on. He started again. [PARAGRAPH:1]"He broke the law, why shouldn't it apply to him? What is special about this man that he should flaunt our restrictions while others are punished justly for them?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"His life is mine to give or take, as is your counsel. Go on to other topics, you won't receive anything that will satisfy you with this one."[PARAGRAPH:1]Dain began to argue back, but he sensed a gravity in her that he didn't understand. She wouldn't be moved on this matter, and Valledia had her reasons even if she wouldn't share them. She was as stubborn and logical a creature as he had ever met. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Fine, to this truce then. The priests say that the Elohim are withdrawing from their war with the Infernals." [PARAGRAPH:1]"And?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"The Infernals are not as weak as some suppose, if they are agreeing to peace with the Elohim then it is only because they wish to carry on battle somewhere else. The Elohim are a powerful force and they must see easier targets to feed upon, the Bannor, the Lanun or us." [PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia waited to see if he would continue with his logic, but for all of his arcane skill he had a disappointing inability to anticipate the future. [PARAGRAPH:1]"The priests are right, at least on this, the Elohim have already agreed to peace. What would you have me do about it?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"We need to go to Cahir Abbey and meet with Einion, to talk him into resuming this war." [PARAGRAPH:1]"Do you think that we could convince Einion to go back on his word? To forfeit a signed deal because if he doesn't sacrifice Elohim lives we might have to sacrifice Amurite ones? Or do you think that even attempting to do that will not only fail but draw the Infernals wrath at our attempt, and we will have the war you fear so much."[PARAGRAPH:1]Dain began pacing. Although shortsighted at times he was an Amurite and once presented with a logical argument he would consider it carefully. He reached out to a burning brazier that hung in the chamber and his finger cut the smoke into twin plumes. At Dain's silent command the smoke gathered and formed itself into two images, one of Hyborem and the other of Einion. He studied both of them, looking for some sign of their nature in the fabricated images. He spoke slowly as he thought through each statement, trying to see if there was anyway to work around it and finding himself trapped by them. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Einion won't break his truce. Hyborem will attack another civilization. If that civilization is us, we will likely die. Do we have something Hyborem wants, something we could trade for peace if we needed it?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"What would a demon want except to kill?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"Is there a reason you suspect that he will attack the Lanun or the Bannor instead of us?" [PARAGRAPH:1]"No, like most predators he will go after the weakest of his targets, that is us. Ready your wizards for war, it will come to us. Slip the firebows from the coastal borders to those we share with the Infernals." [PARAGRAPH:1]Dain nodded, understanding the situation. Understanding that diplomacy was lost, he turned his mind to war. [PARAGRAPH:1]"I will begin to train adepts to sanctify the land, no doubt we will be facing the taint. We may want to consider a show of support for the Order, they could be strong allies soon. [PARAGRAPH:1]"You are right, I will handle the Order, stay to your mages." [PARAGRAPH:1]"I should go, I have much to do."[PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia nodded and Dain turned to leave. She stopped him before he left the chamber. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Dain, I have foreseen this war and moved to save us from it. Though the night will be long, morning will come. The Elohim will rejoin the war, as they have borne a great enmity against the Infernals and wont be able to watch us fall to them. When the Infernals have taken our border cities and march toward our capitals we will go to them, talk of those we have lost, and they will break their truce and join us." [PARAGRAPH:1]"They bear no love for us. Their hated for the Infernals must be greater than I imagined." [PARAGRAPH:1]Valledia only nodded.</Spanish>

		<Spanish>Although the Apprentice has no innate advantage over a regular Adept (other than those provided by the Amurites' unique training facilities), they do offer added flexibility.  In addition to being able to upgrade to the powerful Wizard, they can also choose to upgrade into a Spellsword, Firebow, Horse Archer, or Ranger.  Even more usefully, once Sorcery is researched Apprentices that have been upgraded to another unit type can still learn Channeling II upon reaching level 4.</Spanish>

		<English>Magic comes easily to Amurites.  While for most units the Amurites bring to bear against their enemies this means they have the time to easily pick up one or two cantrips, for those dedicated to magic it means that the mastery comes easier, and thus they have time to extend their own knowledge further into other disciplines.  Most learned Amurite mages stay back in the towns, teaching in the Wizard's Halls.  The units that the Amurites field in offense and defense are not Archmages, but the fearsome Battlemage unit - powerful, talented mages who have also seen fit to understand how to operate in a combat situation.  Battlemages can fend off enemy combat units with ease compared to other civilization's Archmagi, and are a valuable asset to any Amurite army. While only slightly stronger than the standard, they can also use Bronze, Iron, and Mithril weapons, and they have a bonus against land units.</English>

La plupart des Mages amurites lettrés restent dans les villes, enseignant dans les Écoles de Sorcellerie. Les unités que les Amurites envoient au combat ne sont pas des Archimages, mais les terrifiants Mages de Bataille, de puissants et talentueux mages qui semblent également taillés pour comprendre comment agir en situtaion de combat. Les Mages de Bataille peuvent facilement contrer les unités de combat ennemies comparées aux aux Archimages des autres civilisations, et sont un atout dans toute armée Amurite. Bien qu'ils ne soient qu'un tout petit peu plus puissants que l'unité standard, ils peuvent également utiliser des armes de Bronze, de Fer, et de Mithril, et ont un bonus face aux unités terrestres.</French>

I maghi Amurite più istruiti rimangono nelle città, insegnando nella Sala degli Stregoni. Le unità che gli Amurite dispiegano in attacco e in difesa non sono Arcimaghi, ma le temibili unità di Maghi da Battaglia - maghi talentuosi e potenti, che hanno ritenuto importante imparare come operare in una situazione di combattimento. I Maghi da Battaglia possono respigere le unità da combattimento nemiche più facilmente rispetto agli Arcimaghi delle altre civiltà, e sono un'importante risorsa in ogni esercito Amurite. Sebbene solo leggermente più forti rispetto allo standard, possono anche fare uso delle armi in Bronzo, Ferro, e Mithril, e hanno anche un bonus contro le unità terrestri.</Italian>

Afin de s'assurer la tranquilité, un défenseur de ville particulier fut imaginé.

Agli arcieri particolarmente leali e dotati veniva fornito un addestramento incentrato sulla magia del fuoco, permettendogli di incantare le frecce e creare palle di fuoco per chiedere più persuasivamente agli attaccanti di lasciare in pace gli Amurite. </Italian>

		<English>Mage guilds, established in every kingdom, ostensibly exist to serve the ruler by training up a new generation of magical adepts. In reality, most wizards are extremely reluctant to share their power, and their guilds are often used to retard the spread of their craft. Aspirants face circular regulations, years of drudgery, and a fanatical hoarding of any useful texts. The best of the arcane masters worry about the corrupting influence the power might exert upon an unready mind and soul. Most, however, jealously guard their power for more selfish reasons. A desire to retain the prestige that their secrets grant them for some; others suspect that the power they share is a resource like any other and fear its gradual diminishment. Many are simply absorbed in their studies, and abhor the thought of taking time away from their own growth to supervise a bumbling apprentice.[PARAGRAPH:1]Not so Govannon. He is a spiritual as well as a physical descendant of Kylorin, believing that creation will only be complete when human society is at every level imbued with every power the gods used in creating it.

"It is proof," he says, "that it is not the arcane power that corrupts, for how could the power of creation cause harm to the created?

		<French>Les guildes de mages établies dans chaque royaume existent ostensiblement pour servir le seigneur en entraînant une nouvelle génération d'adeptes de la magie. En réalité, la plupart des magiciens sont extrêmement réticents à partager leur pouvoir, et leurs guildes sont souvent utilisés pour retarder l'expansion de leur savoir. Les aspirants doivent faire face à des règles circulaires, des années de corvées, et la collecte fanatique de tout texte d'une quelconque utilité. Les meilleurs maîtres des arcanes se soucient de l'influence corruptrice que le pouvoir pourrait exercer sur un esprit et une âme mal préparés. La plupart cependant, veillent jalousement sur leur pouvoir pour des raisons plus égoïstes. Un désir de conserver le prestige que leur confèrent leurs secrets pour certains, tandis que d'autres suspectent que le pouvoir qu'ils partagent est une ressource comme aucune autre et craignent son affaiblissement progressif.

Il est un descendant spirituel de Kylorin, tout autant qu'un descendant physique, croyant que la création ne sera complète que quand chaque société humaine sera à chaque strate imprégnée de chaque pouvoir utilisé par les dieux pour la créer. Il enseigne aux enfants mendiants comment changer la pierre en pain, aux jeunes hommes à pousser leurs corps au-delà des limites physiques, and jeunes demoiselles à inspirer leurs champions avec une image cristalline bien meilleure que les gravures banales de la mémoire. Sa patience sans limites dans la poursuite de son but utopique agace l'aristocratie magique Amurite au plus haut point, mais ses pouvoirs rivalisent avec les meilleurs d'entre eux, et la Reine a pris conscience du potentiel d'une armée entrainée par Govannon.[PARAGRAPH:1]Les vieilles lèvres tannées de Govannon souriaient doucement quand il se remémorait la consternation qu'il provoquait. "C'est la preuve," disait-il, "que ce n'est pas le pouvoir arcanique qui corrompt, car comment le pouvoir de la création pourrait nuire à ce qui est créé ? C'est le secret, et plus encore la fausse estime envers ces soi-disant sages qui pervertir leurs esprits."</French>
		<German>Magische Zirkel, sie sind in jedem Königreich zu finden, existieren offiziell um dem Herrscher zu dienen, indem sie neue Generationen von magischen Adepten ausbilden. In Wirklichkeit sind die meisten Zauberer äußerst zurückhaltend darin, ihre Macht zu teilen, und ihre Gilden werden oft benutzt, um die Ausbreitung ihrer Kräfte zu verhindern. Aspiranten sehen zyklischen Regelungen, Jahren von Schinderei, und einer fanatischen Anhäufung von jeder Art von nützlichen Schriften entgegen. Die besten der magisch begabten Meister sorgen sich um den korrumpierenden Einfluss, den die Kraft auf einen unreifen Geist und eine unreife Seele ausüben könnte. Die meisten jedoch bewahren ihre Kraft eifersüchtig aus selbstgefälligeren Gründen. Für manche sind diese ein Verlangen, die Prestige die ihre Geheimnisse ihnen gewähren; andere vermuten, dass die Kraft die sie mit anderen teilen, ein Rohstoff wie jeder andere auch ist, und fürchten seine kontinuierliche Verminderung. Viele sind einfach von ihren Studien in Anspruch genommen, und verabscheuen den Gedanken, Zeit für ihr eigenes Vorankommen an die Aufsicht über einen ungeschickten Lehrling zu verschwenden.[PARAGRAPH:1]Nicht so Govannon. Er ist sowohl ein geistiger als auch ein körperlicher Nachkomme Kylorins, und glaubt dass die Schöpfung erst dann vollendet sein wird, wenn die menschliche Gesellschaft in jeder Schicht mit jeder Kraft ausgestattet ist, die die Götter nutzten um sie zu schaffen. Er zeigt Bettelkindern wie man Steine in Brot verwandelt, jungen Männern wie sie ihre Körper jenseits ihrer physischen Grenzen nutzen können, und jungen Mädchen wie sie ihre Favoriten mit einem kristallenen Bild jenseits der Fähigkeiten von gewöhnlicher Erinnerung inspirieren können. Diese selbstlose Leidenschaft in seiner utopischen Mission sorgt in der magischen Aristokratie der Armurite für Unbehagen ohne Ende, aber seine Macht gleicht der der stärksten von ihnen, und die Königin hat das Potential einer von Govannon ausgebildeten Armee erkannt.[PARAGRAPH:1]Govannons alte zerfurchte Lippen lächeln ein wenig, wenn er an die Bestürzung erinnert wird, die er verursacht. "Es ist bewiesen", sagt er, "dass es nicht die magischen Kräfte sind, die korrumpieren, denn wie sollten die Kräfte der Schöpfung den Wesen der Schöpfung ein Leid antun? Es ist die Geheimniskrämerei, und mehr noch, die falsche Einschätzung, in der diese so genannten weisen Männer gefangen sind, die ihre Gedanken umschlingt."</German>
		<Italian>Le gilde dei maghi, istituite in ogni regno, apparentemente esistono per servire il sovrano addestrando una nuova generazione di adepti della magia. In realtà, la maggior parte dei maghi sono estremamente restii a condividere il loro potere, e le loro gilde sono spesso usate per ritardare la diffusione della loro arte. Gli aspiranti devono affrontare una normativa circolare, anni di duro lavoro, e un accumulo fanatico di ogni testo utile. I migliori maestri arcani si preoccupano dell'influenza negativa che il potere potrebbe avere su un'anima e una mente non preparate. La maggior parte, invece, custodisce gelosamente il loro potere per ragioni più egoistiche. L'intenzione di mantenere il prestigio che il loro segreti gli conferiscono per alcuni; altri sospettano che il potere che condividono è come una risorsa come tante altre e temono la sua graduale scomparsa. Molti sono semplicemente cosi immersi nei loro studi che detestano l'idea di dover prendere tempo dalla loro crescita personale per supervisionare un maldestro apprendista.[PARAGRAPH:1]Non è cosi Govannon. È un discendente di Kylorin nello spirito oltre ad esserlo fisicamente, che crede che la creazione sarà veramente completa quando la società umana sarà permeata ad ogni livello con ogni potere che gli dei hanno usato nella sua creazione. Lui insegna ai bambini di strada come trasformare le pietre in pane, ai giovani uomini come spingere i loro corpi oltre i loro limiti fisici, e alle giovani donne come ispirare i loro campioni con un immagine cristallina oltre i limiti della memoria mondana. Questa pazienza disinteressata nella sua ricerca utopistica infastidisce l'aristocrazia magica degli Amurite a non finire, ma il suo potere rivaleggia quello dei più forti tra loro, e la Regina comprende il potenziale di un'esercito addestrato da Govannon.[PARAGRAPH:1]Govannon sorride semplicemente quando gli ricordano lo sbigottimento che causa. "È la prova," dice, "che non è il potere arcano che corrompe, perché come può il potere della creazione causare danno a ciò che ha creato? È la segretezza, e ancor di più, la falsa stima in cui questi uomini saggi sono tenuti che cambia le loro menti".</Italian>
