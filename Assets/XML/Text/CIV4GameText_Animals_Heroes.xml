		<English>No one knows what happened to the Aifons. There was a prophecy of destruction, a sense of foreboding and a coming darkness that went on for years. Strange events became more frequent, animals that lived in peace with the Aifons turned violent, animals were born with deformities and the most spiritual suffered horrible nightmares.[PARAGRAPH:1]The omens were so prevalent that their most promising young adventurer was sent to sequester help. What he found was all bad, without exception every prophet foretold his death and the death of his people. Some told of even worse than death, of eternal loss. Some just fell to tears when they tried to augur his future.[PARAGRAPH:1]Trenton never did find out exactly what could cause such destruction, but he did find a way to stop it. A ritual that would allow Danalin himself to enter creation.[PARAGRAPH:1]The quest for it was a long one and Trenton met and learned a lot about the Godswar, the Compact and Godslayer. He talked to Branding of the Grigori about the role of the gods, and priests of most of the good and neutral religions. In the end he stood upon the island home of his people the day before their prophesied doom and considered his options. His friends were around him, the ritual was in hand and he had everything he needed to perform it. But he decided not to do it.[PARAGRAPH:1]Maybe Trenton didn't believe that the threat was real. Maybe he though it was just a trick to restart the Godswar. Or maybe he knew that even though what he did might save his people, it would eventually destroy many more.[PARAGRAPH:1]The next day was still and silent. Children played in the water as the adults sat and waited nervously. Every solider stood vigilant guard under the silver symbol of their people, a bottomless triangle that many assumed was a shark fin but was in fact the central mountain of their island home. Despite Trenton's decision not to perform the ritual Danalin still loved his children and awoke the greatest of his creations to protect them. Chief among these was the great Leviathan who swam deep beneath the island awaiting any attack.[PARAGRAPH:1]The peace was shattered by a sudden flood of irrational cries and prayers from the Aifons, then nothing. No souls passed into Danalin's vault, none passed into Arawn's underworld. They were simply gone.[PARAGRAPH:1]The islands themselves are uninhabited now, though there is evidence people lived there (both above and below the water) the entire area is tainted with the same influence the Aifons had noticed up until the attack. But there was nothing left of any of the people, Trenton or his companions.[PARAGRAPH:1]The only creature to have survived the attack was the Leviathan, though he has been driven mad by it. He is now a mindless killer taking every opportunity to destroy any life he comes across. If the memories of the attack remain in the Leviathans mind, they are nothing but haunted visions that drive him on.</English>

		<German>Niemand weiß, was mit den Aifons geschehen ist. Es gab eine Vorhersage über eine Zerstörung, eine Ahnung einer Ankündigung, und eine beginnende Dunkelheit, die Jahre andauerte. Seltsame Ereignisse häuften sich, die ehemals friedlich mit den Aifons zusammen lebenden Tiere wendeten sich gegen sie, Missgeburten unter den Tieren häuften sich, und die Gläubigsten wurden von grausamen Albträumen heimgesucht.[Paragraph:1]Die Vorzeichen traten so verbreitet auf, dass sie ihren vielversprechendesten jungen Helden aussandten, um Hilfe zu ersuchen. Aber er fand nur schlechtes, jeder Prophet, den er traf, sagte seinen Tod und den seiner Mitmenschen Voraus. Manche prophezeiten ihm auch schlimmeres als den Tod, nämlich ewige Qualen. Manche brachen sogar in Tränen aus, als sie versuchten, seine Zukunft vorherzusagen.[Paragraph:1]Trenton fand nie heraus, was solch eine Zerstörung anrichten kann, aber er fand einen Weg, sie aufzuhalten. Ein Ritual, das Danalin selbst erlauben würde, die Schöpfung zu betreten.[Paragraph:1]Die Suche dauerte nicht sehr lange, und Trenton lernte viel über den Kampf der Götter, den Vertrag und den Götterschlächter. Er sprach zu Branding von den Grigori über die Rolle der Götter, und über die Priester der meisten neutralen und guten Religionen. Am Ende stand er auf seiner Heimatinsel am Tag, bevor das prophezeite Unheil über sie hereinbrechen sollte, und dachte daran, was ihm noch zu tun bliebe. Seine Freunde waren um ihn versammelt, das Ritual war zur Durchführung bereit und er hatte alles, was nötig war, um es zu vollziehen. Aber er tat es nicht.[Paragraph:1]Vielleicht glaubte Trenton nicht, dass die Gefahr echt war. Vielleicht glaubte er, dass es nur ein Trick war, um den Krieg der Götter neu zu entfachen. Oder vielleicht wusste, er, dass es, auch wenn es seine Mitmenschen retten würde, es vielen mehr Schaden könnte.[Paragraph:1]Der nächste Tag war ruhig und friedlich. Die Kinder spielten im Wasser, währen die Erwachsenen herumsaßen und nervös warteten. Alle Soldaten standen kampfbereit unter dem Zeichen ihres Reiches, einem Dreieck ohne Boden, was viele als eine Haifischflosse deuteten, aber in Wirklichkeit den zentralen Berg der Insel darstellte. Trotz Trentons Entscheidung, das Ritual nicht durchzuführen, liebte Danalin seine Kinder immer noch so sehr, dass er die großartigste seiner Schöpfungen erweckte, um sie zu beschützen. Die größte unter ihnen war der riesige Leviathan, der tief unter der Insel schwamm, jeden Angriff erwartend.[Paragraph:1]Der Frieden wurde durch eine unerwartete Flut von Schreien und Gebeten der Aifons zerstört, dann kam nichts. Keine Seelen kamen in Danalins Himmelsgewölbe, keine kam in Arawans Unterwelt. Sie waren einfach verschwunden.[Paragraph:1]Die Insel selbst ist nun unbewohnt, auch wenn es Anzeichen gibt, dass Leute hier gelebt haben, (sowohl über als auch unter Wasser), und das gesamte Gebiet ist mit einer Aura umgeben, die die Aifons vor dem Angriff spürten. Aber es blieb nichts zurück von diesen Leuten, Trenton und seinem Gefolge.[Paragraph:1]Das einzige Wesen, dass den Angriff überlebte, war Leviathan, aber er verfiel dem Wahnsinn. Er ist nun ein hirnloser Mörder, der jede Gelegenheit wahr nimmt, alles Leben zu zerstören, dass ihm begegnet. Die Erinnerungen des Angriffes bleiben im Gedächtnis des Leviathan am Leben, es sind nichts als diese Visionen, die ihn antreiben.</German>
