		<English>"Captain Ostanes? That idiotic dandy? I tell you, if his father hadn't been a good friend of Tasunke, he never would have made it past Corporal. That man has no respect for rules and regulation, and if I wasn't there to make up for his woeful lack of understanding of logistics or military structure, this entire operation would collapse overnight into a bloodlust- and alcohol-fueled mob. One time, he even took a tiny reserve force to sneak attack a Malakim encampment before the main body of our army was even in the region, and his plan was to, and I quote, 'go beyond the impossible.' Seriously, what does that even mean?"[NEWLINE]"Also, I suspect that he spends as much each year on fancy clothes and expensive wine as I do on my entire siege regiment. More, if you count the hats."[NEWLINE]--Captain Uldanor, after several drinks following the Battle of Dunkirk Hill.</English>

Every move considered, planned out, discussed for hours, nay, DAYS on end... it's a wonder his troops ever leave their encampments. I tell you, his plodding brand of pedantic I-dotting and T-crossing is the bane of the army, and he even lacks the respect for heroism and bold initiative that's the mark of any true leader of men. If I wasn't there to push us forward, I daresay the army would never get to fight at all-- our entire force would be occupied full-time in filling out supply request forms and status reports.

		<English>[PARAGRAPH]Xivan walked through the opulent throne room.  The people of this land certainly put forth a lot of work for a mere mortal, that seemed to be the case indeed.  How much more would they give him?[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]He turned around slowly - the Consumer held tightly in his left hand.  The very air seemed to warp around it's ebony blade - forged from a single dark stone in eons past. As he curved it through the air, the soft screaming sound it made was evident to all in the hushed room.  He walked - sauntered, even - over to the figure crying, put to it's knees and bound tightly, as he had long before Xivan put forth the effort to climb the stairwell to the palace throne room.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"It is very beautiful - this room, this city.  Like you're trying to compensate for something.  Is it your mortality? Is it the fact that even on that throne you remain subservient to the gods?  Or is it the fact that deep down, you know you are no better than those that serve you?"[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]As Xivan looked down at the feeble mortal... thing... it, spat, almost hitting his shoe, had his reflexes not preserved himself from being insulted so.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"My people will never serve you, creature.  They are loyal to me, no matter what a few scum who once called themselves my advisers say!"[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Xivan brought the Consumer down, severing the leader's head from neck, leaving only a bloody stump attached to the body.  Xivan picked up the ruler's scepter, and smashed the head down on it, making a cruel pike and a symbol to everyone else in the room.  He turned to his new military commander - a man who was once trusted by the corpse on the floor - a man who, for a short time, would be important to Xivan.[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]"Take this thing out to the city square.  If any people in this city are still loyal to it, make sure they follow it directly to the Vaults.  The rest can turn to our business, to my business.  There are only rewards for the faithful, and all my enemies will be the enemies of this city, then of these people, then of my empire.  All who oppose our destiny must feel the bite of our blades."[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH]Xivan almost laughed as the man dragged the heavy corpse out.  Our destiny?  This was all Xivan's destiny, and the people - all the people on Erebus - were soon to be his chess pieces in the bleak little game.  But one day, it would be the Gods pushed off their thrones.</English>

		<English>Gosea can channel spirits, usually demons, but has no ability to control them. Instead they possess her and use her as a puppet. She has power, but no will, and she is helpless to be anything but a victim to the forces that control her. [PARAGRAPH:4]Fideism[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 1[PARAGRAPH]Stained glass windows decorated the walls of the Fenestran temple. The windows were so large the walls seemed more glass than stone. The windows on the east favored yellow while those on the west side of the temple favored orange which caused the airy temple to change hue throughout the day. [PARAGRAPH]The temples dome was topped by a plain round window so at noon, as it was now, it was at its brightest. The light reflected off the temples polished bronze columns, leaving few shadows in the large room. The rooms focus was at its center where a pillar of light fell on a priest wearing pale yellow robes and the man that knelt before him. A small group of friends and family dotted the first few pews of the temple, a modest but proud turnout. [PARAGRAPH]"In duty and honor I consecrate this man to you dear Lugus, rose of summer. So that his life and spirit may be yours, to use and guide as you see fit. Bless him and keep him in your care as he remains vigilant to your will and that of the church. "[PARAGRAPH]"Arise Mikel Alaunus, new man of Bourne. " the priest continued. "As a humble servant of Lugus and this city I consecrate you as captain Alaunus, champion of the dawn, holy knight in the army of Bourne the Gleaming. Arise and accept the mandate of truth, throw your secrets away and join the revealing light of Lugus. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel stood. He was nearly a head taller than the young priest and his broad shoulders were evident even beneath the loose ceremonial tunic. His skin was the color of copper, as compared to the milky cast of the others in the room, and where his tunic fell low on his neck the black swirl of a tattoo could be seen. Mikel wasn't afraid of the mandate of truth, but public speaking, even to this small crowd, made him nervous. [PARAGRAPH]"I grew up in an orphanage in Galveholm, capital of the Sheaim empire. " Mikel began. "The orphanage wasn't like those here in Bourne. It wasn't a place to raise children, it was a place to store them. Galveholm is a brutal, violent city, full of promise and power for those willing to take it, and little protection for anyone else. "[PARAGRAPH]"I killed a man, a boy really, when I was twelve. His name was Augess and though he was only a year younger, he was small for his age. I struck out of habit more than any real malice, but he was angry at the way we treated him. He attacked me. He was in a rage, but still too weak to hurt me. I became angry too, and I killed him in the orphanage stairwell surrounded by the cruel cheers of the other boys. "[PARAGRAPH]"By the time I was fifteen I had killed two more. I was a murderer, an extortionist, a thief and a liar. My skill with a sword made me useful to cruel men. But when the man I worked for was assassinated, when others who worked for him began to die, I fled. "[PARAGRAPH]"I worked on caravans and ships before ending up in Bourne. I knew as soon as I saw this city I wanted to stay here. The cities high white walls, the battlements that seemed to be topped with gold and the cathedrals that dotted the city's skyline were all so different from the twisted towers and dark alleys of Galveholm. "[PARAGRAPH]"I was nearly arrested when I tried to enter the city. I am Sheaimic by birth and my tattoos are not only evidence of my past, but illegal in Bourne. After speaking with Gate Captain Marlowe he agreed to allow me my freedom if I worked on a local farm and stayed out of the city. I did so, working for Ferris Tawns, for just over three years. "[PARAGRAPH]"Ferris was a wonderful boss, and the years spent on his farm were my happiest to that point in my life. "[PARAGRAPH]Ferris and his wife, who were sitting near the back of the small group, didn't display any emotion at the praise. This wasn't simple appreciation, but a religious ceremony and everyone understood that regardless of what was revealed, the mandate of truth wasn't about those in the story, it was about the speaker. [PARAGRAPH]"I am ashamed to say I stole from Ferris while I worked from him. Though he shared his table with me, and paid me well I stole small things I could sell to traders on the road. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel was relieved to notice Ferris and his wife remained stoic. That was harder for him to admit than the murders. Failing after changing his life seemed like a bigger loss than the things he had done before. [PARAGRAPH]"Gate Captain Marlowe kept in touch with me and made sure his mercy was well placed. He eventually allowed me to travel with Ferris to the city's market to sell produce, and I enjoyed those trips. I befriended the market guards and when they were looking for new recruits, with Ferris and Marlowe's blessing, I applied. "[PARAGRAPH]"I have been working in the market for the past seven years. It was where I met my wife Deirdre, who I love deeply. We have been married for five years and four years ago we had a daughter, Anna. "[PARAGRAPH]Anna was unable to maintain the stoic expression and beamed at the mention of her name. Though Deirdre looked outwardly passive and listening, Mikel knew she was nearly as nervous as he was. The mandate of truth caused a lot of new knights to reveal past infidelities and crimes that sometimes destroyed families. Mikel was delighted he had no transgressions against his marriage, wife or daughter to admit. [PARAGRAPH]"Shortly after Anna's birth I began to feel drawn to the cities temples. Deirdre's father had been a knight commander in the church and gave his life in service to Lugus. My friend and fellow guardsman Ceth spent many shifts talking about his faith and the Empyrean . In time I began attending dawn rituals with him and my family. "[PARAGRAPH]"Three weeks ago I was offered the opportunity to become a knight in the service of Lugus and lead my own guard unit on the north bridge. I am undeserving of this honor, but I will give my devotion, my life, and my eternal soul, to the service of Lugus and to this city. "[PARAGRAPH]At this Mikel knelt again. [PARAGRAPH]The priest rubbed his thumb in a small pot on his belt, scooping out honey colored oil which he rubbed on Mikel's closed eyes. [PARAGRAPH]"Remember you carry the mandate of truth with you always. " the priest intoned. "Open your eyes to a world without deception, live your life revealed and without fear. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel opened his eyes. The oil burned and through the amber haze the bright temple appeared even brighter. Mikel could hear the people in the pews standing up and talking to each other, friends congratulating his wife. But he could only see a dizzying dance of light. The stained glass windows, once beautiful but lifeless, now glowed with an inner fire that made them seem alive. Angels and saints of the Empyrean looked down at him in full radiant glory. And one, an angel with a crescent shaped shield and a hand lost to golden light, seemed to float apart from the window. The angel looked down at Mikel with a look of passive benevolence. The angel reached out its burning hand, as if to touch Mikel on the forehead. But the light was too bright and although Mikel's eyes teared up as he tried to watch the vision, he was forced to blink and the room returned to normal. The angel was once again just a figure in the window. [PARAGRAPH]With one last look at the window Mikel turned back to the priest. [PARAGRAPH]"Thank you Literal Edain," Mikel said to the priest, "It is an honor I will give my life to uphold. "[PARAGRAPH]The priest smiled, but said nothing. [PARAGRAPH]"Is any sort of donation customary?" Mikel added quietly, embarrassed he was unaware of the protocol. [PARAGRAPH]"No my son," the priest said patting Mikel's hand. "You do a great service for our god. It is I who should be thanking you. Go and enjoy the day and your family. Though I expect to see you for morning devotions. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course eyeman . "[PARAGRAPH]The rest of the small group joined in congratulating Mikel. But Mikel found himself glancing back at the window that showed the angel with the crescent shield. After a few minutes Mikel was able to break away and ask the priest about it. [PARAGRAPH]"Literal Edain, who is the angel in the third eastern window?" Mikel asked. "The one with the crescent shield?"[PARAGRAPH]The priest stopped putting away the objects from the ceremony and looked at the window as if trying to remember. [PARAGRAPH]"I believe his name is Verchiel. Nearly sixty years ago, soon after this temple was first built, an occisor chased two children in here. A nine year old girl named Amelie and her brother, who was a few years younger. Amelie fell at the foot of the altar and prayed for help while her brother tried to fight the occisor. The boy was killed, but when the occisor went for Amelie, Verchiel protected her. The occisor fled from the temple and Amelie devoted her life to the Empyrean. "[PARAGRAPH]After a pause the priest added, "Why do you ask?"[PARAGRAPH]"The oil. . . " Mikel said clumsily, "I mean, I thought I saw that angel move during the ceremony. "[PARAGRAPH]"That is good. " Edain said, though Mikel couldn't tell if he was being patronizing or if visions like his were so common that the priest was unimpressed by it. Edain patted Mikel's arm and without saying more went back to storing the altar cloth in the small recess behind the altar. [PARAGRAPH]Deirdre approached the altar still beaming with pride at her husband. Anna followed her mother, anxious to hug her father but unsure if she was allowed to come close yet. Anna beamed up at Mikel with a smile identical to her mother's as he scooped her up in his arms. [PARAGRAPH]"My mother has a carriage ready, I think she is almost as proud of you as I am. " Deirdre whispered as she hugged Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 2[PARAGRAPH]At dawn the next morning Mikel was back at the temple. It was nearly full as the crowd went through morning devotions, alternatively sitting in quiet reflection, open prayer, and listening to Literal Edain speak. This morning Edain talked about Bridgit, the archangel of Bhall, who remained true to her goddess's mandate of divine passion even as Bhall fell to the whispers of Agares. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth sat on one side of Mikel, and Deirdre on the other. Anna sat on her mother's lap dutifully listening to the sermon, her eyes wide with wonder. She had blue ribbons in her blond hair, and in the yellow light of the temple her hair seemed to be made of gold. [PARAGRAPH]With a whispered blessing Literal Edain dismissed the congregation and almost as one the crowd rose to leave. Mikel interrupted the group funneling out to give his wife and daughter a quick kiss. [PARAGRAPH]"I will see you tonight. " Mikel whispered. Then to Ceth he added, "Can you wait for me? I want to speak to the eyeman. "[PARAGRAPH]Ceth nodded and stepped outside to get out of the way of those leaving behind him. After a hug Deirdre and her mother took Anna out into the city, already talking about their plans for the day. Mikel waited until the temple was clear before he approached Edain. [PARAGRAPH]"Eyeman, do you have a minute?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course. " Edain said sitting in the first pew and signaling Mikel to sit beside him. "What is it?"[PARAGRAPH]"It's about the mandate of truth. I have a question about when it is appropriate. "[PARAGRAPH]Edain sat passively, giving no indication if these sorts of questions were expected or unusual after someone has been through the ceremony. [PARAGRAPH]"I am a part of a lie, but it is not my secret. " Mikel said, "My mother-in-law believes I met Dierdre while working as a guard in the market, that I saved her from a thief. The truth is, we met when I caught Deirdre stealing from one of the merchants. "[PARAGRAPH]Again there was no indication if this surprised Edain or not. [PARAGRAPH]"I want to be honest with my mother-in-law, but I don't want to violate my wife's trust. What does the mandate of truth require of me? What does Lugus ask?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Edain offered a practiced smile. "The mandate of truth is a heavy burden. One that cannot be forced on any man, and must be accepted willingly. You cannot force your wife to live under its restrictions just because you do. To do so is to invite secrets between you, and the purpose of the mandate of truth is to live without secrets. "[PARAGRAPH]Edain paused before continuing. "But, you should encourage your wife to be honest in all things. This lie does not protect her, it traps her. One cannot change the past simply by saying it is not so. Speaking personally I have known AnnaSophia for many years, and I have no doubt she will have compassion for her daughter if she is told the truth. "[PARAGRAPH]"Yes eyeman. " Mikel said, "You are right. Thank you. "[PARAGRAPH]After another thanks Mikel headed out of the temple, where Ceth waited for him. They were a few blocks from the north bridge and the walk was a good way to warm up on the cold morning. [PARAGRAPH]The north bridge was unguarded during the winter. The few that crossed it were local farmers and traders, and even they were infrequent. But once the northern passes opened, activity would increase until it became one of the busiest bridges in Bourne. [PARAGRAPH]When it was built the bridge was wide enough that one of the aspen trees that grew along the rivers northern bank could have been laid across it. But since that time merchants had setup stalls on both sides of the bridge and there was barely room left for two caravans to pass. [PARAGRAPH]When Mikel and Ceth arrived the gates at both ends of the bridge were closed. Mikel unlocked each and turned to look at the empty stalls and the bridge tower. A deer stood in the woods at the north end of the bridge watching the two men. [PARAGRAPH]"Are we supposed to protect the city from the deer?" Ceth asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Laugh now, in a few weeks you will have more than enough work. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"By work you mean sitting by the tower watching caravans roll by, right?" Ceth said. [PARAGRAPH]"Right, and the occasional patrol up and down the bridge. But don't worry, we have some real work today. " Mikel said unlocking the bridge tower and opening it to stuffy room with a small jail, desk and armory. A nest of webs filled the corners of the room and the dried husks of rats hung in the webbing. [PARAGRAPH]"Today we clean. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"Then who is going to keep an eye on the deer?" Ceth said disgusted. [PARAGRAPH]The spider was nearly the size of a man's head, and both the men were glad there was no one else on the bridge to hear their screams as they chased and eventually killed it. They spent the rest of the day cleaning the tower. They accepted a small shipment of weapons and armor, stored them in the armory and then sat outside the tower and watched the river and the leafless woods beyond for the rest of the afternoon. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 3[PARAGRAPH]Just as Mikel promised, within a few weeks the bridge was alive with activity. All of the stalls were open with merchants hawking their wares to passing caravans, and it was rare to have a moment without at least one caravan on the bridge. The woods on the north bank were now green, the days were warmer and Mikel had ten guards, including his lieutenant Ceth, assigned to the north bridge and reporting to him. [PARAGRAPH]"Come down off my wagons!"[PARAGRAPH]The scream was angry, though it was easily lost in the chaos of people arguing over the price of goods, yelling for people to move out of the way of wagons and the sounds of various mules, oxen and chickens scattered over the bridge. [PARAGRAPH]"Guardsman!" an angry merchant yelled, looking at Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]"Captain," Mikel corrected, "and what can I do for you?"[PARAGRAPH]"There is a man, a thief, rooting through my goods. " the merchant exclaimed. He was a large man and his face was bright red with anger. He looked to be about to climb up onto the wagon where a wiry man poked beneath the tarps that covered it, if he could manage to lift his bulk up off the road, which didn't seem likely. [PARAGRAPH]"Greylin," Mikel called, "get off the wagon. I've warned you about this before. "[PARAGRAPH]"Mikel, tell him I'm no thief. I'm just checking to see what he has for sale. " Then turning to the red faced merchant Greylin added, "How much do you want for these radishes? I could take the whole batch off your hands. "[PARAGRAPH]Cutting off the merchant before he started to scream again, Mikel said "Now Greylin, or it's a night in the cell. "[PARAGRAPH]With a look of disappointment Greylin climbed down. "The real thieves are in the market, they won't pay anything for these goods. They don't offer fair deals to outsiders. Not like me, I respect a man who traveled all the way to Bourne. You don't have to be my cousin's sister's whatever to get a fair deal from me. "[PARAGRAPH]"Greylin is harmless. " Mikel said to the merchant whose face was returning to a normal color, "And he isn't a thief, though he is overeager. You won't have any more problems with him. " Mikel said this last point loud enough that Greylin could hear him. [PARAGRAPH]After making sure the merchant wasn't going to attack Greylin, Mikel headed back and sat down outside the guard tower beside Ceth. The two rarely had a chance to work together since Ceth was the bridge lieutenant and in charge of the bridge during shifts Mikel wasn't working. [PARAGRAPH]"Is it any better at night?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"It's not this crowded. But it's steady until dusk, then we get a rush of activity as people try to get into or out of the city. We never get the gates closed on time. " then Ceth added, "I was going to ask Donovan if he could work tonight. Fenton is sick, covered with boils if his wife is to be believed, and I'm down a man. "[PARAGRAPH]"Donovan is sick too, sounds like he may have the same thing. We only have three men on the bridge today. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"Think they may be all off drinking somewhere?" Ceth said half-joking. [PARAGRAPH]"I saw Donovan. " Mikel said, "He looked horrible. A bunch of people in the city have been getting sick, most get better in a few days. I can cover for Fenton, maybe I can talk Deirdre into bringing us some dinner. "[PARAGRAPH]"Are you sure? I can ask someone else. " Ceth said. [PARAGRAPH]"It's no problem, but you have to pay me back by sticking around and covering Donovan's shift for the rest of the day. "[PARAGRAPH]The rest of the day went smoothly. Just as Ceth described there was a rush of activity just before the gates closed and by the time the dusk bells rang throughout Bourne the gates were all still open. Finally a little more than an hour later they were closed and locked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel locked the guard tower and met Ceth for a final walk down to check in with the overnight guards on the north side of the bridge. Walking down they were surprised to see three figures walking toward them. It was too dark to see clearly but it looked to be a woman flanked by two men. One of the men was a bear of a man, thick through the chest and shoulders. He plodded forward with all the grace of a boulder rolling down hill. The other man was the opposite, he was almost lost in the silhouette of his cloak. A slight turn and this man stepped into the shadows of one of the merchant stalls and disappeared. [PARAGRAPH]"Halt. " Ceth called lifting his spear. The two figures they could still see continued walking forward as if they hadn't heard him. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel's hand went instinctively to his sword hilt. Something about these people worried him. The gate guards wouldn't allow anyone on the bridge after closing. And the way one of the companions disappeared spoke to a skill beyond simple travelers. Mikel hadn't even drawn his sword other than to care for it since being assigned to the bridge. He had used his sap a few times and sometimes threatened to use a short cudgel he carried. But this was the first time he was tempted to draw his sword. A blue ribbon tied around the swords hilt reminded him to stay calm. [PARAGRAPH]"Careful," Mikel whispered to Ceth, "there were three of them. "[PARAGRAPH]They were now close enough to see each other. The woman was the most notable, with pale alabaster skin that made her look almost ghostlike in the moonlight. She wore burgundy robes so dark Mikel first mistook them for black, her hair was long and black and her eyes were dark pools. She was beautiful, as long as you avoided her eyes, which were cold and empty. [PARAGRAPH]Her bearlike companion wore a horsehair cloak and worn leather armor. He held a thick double bladed axe casually in his hand, it dripped with a dark liquid. Mikel could see the swirl of black tatoo's sticking out from beneath his leather bracers. [PARAGRAPH]"Sheaim!" Mikel yelled, hand going to his sword. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth lowered his spear, pointing it threateningly at the woman as he stepped towards her. She ignored him, throwing her head back as if to howl. But instead of making any noise Mikel felt a sudden pressure on his ears and head that was so strong it made him dizzy. Not only did the woman make no noise, everything went perfectly silent. The sound of the wind blowing across the tarps over merchant stalls disappeared, the sounds of the river lapping against the bridges foundations was gone, only perfect empty silence remained. [PARAGRAPH]It was silent as the man with the double bladed axe walked towards Mikel. Silent as Ceth approached the woman. Ceth shook his head and looked at Mikel in confusion, whatever was affecting Mikel was affecting him as well. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel drew his sword in time to parry the axeman's attack. He could now see that the liquid on the axe was fresh blood, and he had little doubt it was from the overnight guards. This axeman could have been any of the kids that grew up in the orphanage with him. He had the same copper colored skin, and the same delight on his face at the opportunity to cause pain. [PARAGRAPH]But Mikel was not a simple guardsman grown soft settling disputes between merchants. With force the axeman wasn't expecting Mikel parried the axe and brought an armored elbow up hard against the side of the axeman's face. Suddenly the look of delight was gone, replaced by anger. [PARAGRAPH]The cloaked man that had slipped into the shadows came out. He stepped between Ceth and the woman, and when Ceth lunged with his spear he leapt up and landed easily on the end of Ceth's spear. [PARAGRAPH]There he stood, almost frozen, an axe in each hand and seemingly without affecting the weight of spear at all. Ceth stood unbelieving. First the silence and now this man stood on the tip of his spear as if balancing on a tightrope. The scene had an eerie dreamlike quality. [PARAGRAPH]Meanwhile the axeman Mikel was fighting continued to swing wildly. Mikel drew his cudgel in his left hand and it was quickly destroyed by the powerful axe. Another parry and an elbow to the axeman's face sent the axeman stumbling backwards, cursing soundlessly. Mikel didn't waste the opportunity and stabbed the axeman's exposed side, just below his kidney and through until stopped by the leather plate on the axeman's back. The axeman stumbled back further and fell, a dark pool quickly welled around the wound. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth tried to shake his spear, to knock off the man standing on it. But instead the man ran up the length of the spear. Coming up nearly to Ceth's hand the attacker swung his twin axes, catching Ceth's throat and sending a bright red arch of blood high into the air, some even struck Mikel, though he was over three meters away. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth went back, head down hard into the stone bridge. He dropped the spear and the man nimbly landed on the ground, turning toward Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]The woman stopped her silent howl and sound returned with another dizzying pop of pressure. [PARAGRAPH]"Leave him, run. " the woman said pointing toward the south end of the bridge. Together the two started running toward the city. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel fell at Ceth's side, ignoring the fleeing attackers and the axeman lying wounded on the bridge. Ceth's eyes were spinning wildly in fear and confusion, but they stopped when they locked onto Mikel's. He tried to speak but that only caused more blood to spill out of his open throat. Mikel clasped both hands over Ceth's throat, trying in vain to stop the bleeding, though blood continued to pour through his fingers. [PARAGRAPH]"Please, please, please. " Mikel whispered, trying to contain the horror rushing through him. A deep breath and his thoughts focused, his fear was gone. [PARAGRAPH]"Please, Lugus, lord of the dawn, do not forget us. " Mikel whispered, "Do not let him die. He has seen too few days. Share your mercy and your light with him. "[PARAGRAPH]There was a sudden heat through Mikel's fingers and he felt Ceth gasp. Opening his eyes Mikel saw Verchiel, the angel in the temple, kneeling on the other side of Ceth, mirroring Mikel's pose. Verchiel was praying too, and where the angel's hands passed through Mikel's he felt heat and power. [PARAGRAPH]Any shock or surprise was gone in this moment. Mikel only cared about saving Ceth and did not question the appearance of the glowing angel. Verchiel appeared much like a stained glass window, his skin was golden and slightly translucent and an inner light seemed to radiate from him. He wore modest white robes trimmed in yellow and he had the same crescent shaped bronze shield decorated with beautifully faceted gemstones. [PARAGRAPH]As the warmth faded Verchiel looked up into Mikel's face. "There is a sickness within Bourne. If you have faith we can heal the city. "[PARAGRAPH]"I do, I will. " said Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]At that Verchiel spread his wings, appearing exactly as he did in the window, and disappeared. [PARAGRAPH]"Mikel," Ceth said straining through Mikel's pressure on his throat, "what happened?"[PARAGRAPH]Mikel removed his hands to see two long scars on Ceth's throat. They were thick and bright red, but completely closed and the skin around the wounds looked fresh and healthy. [PARAGRAPH]"The angel healed you. " Mikel said, though he realized how strange those words sounded. [PARAGRAPH]Both men were broken out of their thoughts by the sound of the axeman Mikel had stabbed trying to get up. The axeman grabbed his side, weak from the loss of blood. Despite his obvious pain he was already standing and he raised his axe menacingly. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel rolled up and charged the axeman. Mikel's sword knocked the axe easily aside and Mikel set his shoulder low and into the axeman's chest. The axeman flew backwards, losing hold of his axe as he slammed into the side of a merchant stall and then fell hard against the ground. This time nothing silenced him and his cries were loud and profane. [PARAGRAPH]"I'll take care of him. " Ceth said picking himself up and grabbing his cudgel. [PARAGRAPH]"Are you sure you are okay?" Mikel said, but Ceth moved quickly, rolling the cursing axeman over and tying his hands. Despite the stains of blood on his neck, face and breastplate Ceth was completely recovered from the attack. [PARAGRAPH]"I'm going to warn the city guard, put him in the cell. " Mikel said. Then, without waiting for Ceth's answer, Mikel ran south along the bridge, chasing after the woman and the other attacker. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 4[PARAGRAPH]Mikel couldn't help feeling negligent in missing the next morning's dawn ceremony. As the morning bells rang out through the city he was sitting in a very crowded north bridge tower. Ceth was here as was Mikel's senior officer, Knight Commander Marlowe, and a crowd of other officers and priests. [PARAGRAPH]One of these priests was questioning the axeman, who gave his name as Cain the Torn, and who remained locked in the towers single cell. Mikel listened to the questioning as he and Ceth recounted their memories of the attack. [PARAGRAPH]"Cain, do you think your companions could have overcome the guard captain on their own?" the priest asked the prisoner. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes. " Cain answered. [PARAGRAPH]"Then why would you protect them if they abandoned you so easily? You would be dead if not for our care, left to die or be arrested while they escaped. There are two dead guardsmen, and nearly a third but for the grace of Lugus. Would you bear the burden for these crimes alone?"[PARAGRAPH]Cain didn't answer. He was still pale from the loss of blood and leaned against the cell wall. It was obvious the priest's persistent questions were having some impact on him. Seeing Cain wasn't going to respond the priest tried a different tact. [PARAGRAPH]"Cain, do you have a family. A wife and children?"[PARAGRAPH]"I did. " Cain answered, "I was much worse then. I lost control and killed them. "[PARAGRAPH]Cain seemed to be lost in the memory of the event. His answer quieted the rest of the people in the room, but the priest continued undeterred. [PARAGRAPH]"It is good you admit that. You would not want to die with that burden upon you. You can be forgiven, you can find peace. But this woman, she wanted you to continue killing, to use you. "[PARAGRAPH]"She. . . " Cain said looking up at the people in the room, "knows who I really am. "[PARAGRAPH]"It is not who you have to be. " the priest continued, "Your wife, she saw a different man. She knew who you really are. "[PARAGRAPH]"No," Cain said with emotion, "not until the night I killed her. That was the first time she really saw me. "[PARAGRAPH]The priest continued questioning but Cain didn't offer any further information, and nothing about his companions. Forgiveness and repentance may appeal to those raised in Bourne, but Mikel wasn't surprised the Sheaimic axeman was uninterested in the concepts. [PARAGRAPH]"This is a miracle. " Knight Commander Marlowe said placing his hand on Mikel's shoulder. "A vision, a warning and the life of one of our guardsman saved. This is a blessing not only to you but the city itself. It is an honor that Lugus would intervene. "[PARAGRAPH]"Yes sir. " Mikel said, "I feel like I should be at the dawn ceremony now, or out looking for the woman and the other man. "[PARAGRAPH]"A soldier always wants to be doing. But you are a part of the city, and without moving you are accomplishing both. Runners have been sent to all of the temples and guard stations in Bourne. The guards are all looking for them, and thanks are being offered in all the temples. " Marlowe answered. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel was surprised, he knew the runners had been sent to the guard stations, he had started that process last night. But knowing the priests were being told about his vision made him self-conscious. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth had it even worse. The priests were taking turns investigating the scars on his neck and treating him like a sacred relic. He had been choking on blood until, as if waking from a bad dream, the pain was gone. He thought he was dead except for the flood of cool night air in his lungs. Ceth hadn't seen the angel or known about it until Mikel told him. [PARAGRAPH]"Tomorrow why don't you and Ceth come to the dawn ritual at the Cathedral of Bells ? I am sure Luminary Rimmon would like to meet you. "[PARAGRAPH]"It would be an honor. " Mikel said, though the prospect of meeting the high priest of Bourne made him more nervous than the fight on the bridge. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth agreed to the invitation and the two stayed long enough to sign Cain over to the city guard, who would transport him to city prison. After stopping to give instruction to the day watch, Mikel set off for Dierdre's mother's manor. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel had sent a runner to Dierdre less than an hour after the fight, giving her a short explanation of what had happened and asking her to go to her mother's house to be safe. Mikel had ordered the runner to escort her to her mother's house. [PARAGRAPH]Dierdre's father had been a knight commander in charge of a thousand men. He died on the battlefield, giving his life for Lugus and Bourne in the autumn just after Dierdre's eighth birthday. Before he died he built the squat stone manor, now called Wyn Manor. [PARAGRAPH]The manor had four wings, but since Dierdre's mother AnnaSophia lived in it alone only the east wing remained open. Dierdre met Mikel as he entered the kitchen door the family most commonly used. AnnaSophia was in the kitchen behind her daughter pouring tea. Anna, who had tried to wait up for her father's return, had finally succumbed to sleep and was lost in a tangle of blankets on a couch in the adjoining great room. [PARAGRAPH]"What happened?" Dierdre said, unaccustomed to any change in the normal guard schedule. [PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia, whose marriage contained many mornings like this shooed her daughter away from the door and offered Mikel a seat at the kitchen table, which he gladly dropped into. Mikel didn't have time to speak before a cup of hot tea was placed before him, along with some dry rolls and a small pot of butter. [PARAGRAPH]"Thank you," Mikel mumbled as he ripped off a piece of bread and stuffed it in his mouth. [PARAGRAPH]Noticing Mikel was still covered with sweat and the spray of blood AnnaSophia went to wet a rag for him to clean off with. Before she could do so Dierdre also noticed the dried blood splattered line across his breastplate. [PARAGRAPH]"Is that blood?" Dierdre asked, her voice rising. [PARAGRAPH]"Quiet Diery. " AnnaSophia said, indicating where Anna slept. "Let Mikel eat a bit first, he is here and safe. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel quickly finished eating and washed the blood off his armor while he told both of the women what happened. Dierdre was stunned by Mikel's description of the angel and Ceth's healing, but AnnaSophia only listened carefully and waited until the story was complete to ask her question. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you tell anyone about your vision?" AnnaSophia asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes, of course, I told Knight Commander Marlowe and it was relayed to the guard stations and to the temples before dawn. "[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia's looked down, her brow furrowed, seemingly intent on the crumbs she was sweeping off the counter. [PARAGRAPH]"Do you think I shouldn't have?" Mikel asked. "Do you think I didn't really see an angel?"[PARAGRAPH]"I think you saw an angel. " AnnaSophia said quickly, "But I wonder how the church will accept your miracle and vision. These are rare events, it may be years before we hear of anything similar. What will the church expect of you because of it?"[PARAGRAPH]"They will know he is a hero. That the church did well to make him a captain. " Dierdre answered. [PARAGRAPH]"I am sure you are right. " AnnaSophia said, but she continued brushing off the counter though no crumbs remained. [PARAGRAPH]They talked for a few more minutes before Mikel's exhaustion began to catch up with him. After asking if he could borrow one of the guest bedrooms Mikel picked the sleeping Anna up off the couch and carried her into the bedroom where he placed her gently on the bed before collapsing beside her. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel's dreams where thick and muddy. The fight on the bridge mixed with those from his boyhood in Galveholm. He dreamt about Cain killing his wife and Herod Wyn, a man he had never met, who died in the service of Lugus leaving his wife widowed and his daughter fatherless. And though he searched in his dreams for another vision of the angel, it never came. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 5[PARAGRAPH]The noon bells woke Mikel. It had only been a few hours sleep, but it would have to be enough. He washed up before putting his armor back on. As he was putting his sword belt on he noticed his sword was still stained with Cain's blood. He took the sword out and cleaned it. [PARAGRAPH]The blood had even stained the blue ribbon tied around its hilt. Mikel felt suddenly angry he had been forced into a fight on the bridge, that they had attacked him and killed the other guards. That an angel had intervened and spoken with him, and that Ceth had been injured in the first place. He had hoped his days of sword fights were past. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel kissed Anna, who still lay sleeping peacefully on the bed, and headed down to the great room. [PARAGRAPH]Dierdre had taken her daughter's position on the couch and was snoring softly. AnnaSophia was still in the kitchen, though she peeked in when she heard Mikel before going back to her work. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel walked into the kitchen and saw she was packing a half loaf of bread, a bag of almonds and a fresh canteen. She set it out for him as Mikel entered the room. [PARAGRAPH]"Does this mean I'm leaving?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"If you stay I'll gladly cook you something better. But I don't think your coming downstairs for my cooking. " she answered. [PARAGRAPH]"No, you are right. " Mikel pocketed the food and the canteen then added, "Thank you for your help this morning. I was, I still am, overwhelmed. When Dierdre wakes up could you tell her to wait here for me and I'll come back tonight to walk her home. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course. " AnnaSophia said. [PARAGRAPH]With that Mikel headed out into the city on a walk to the city prison. It was a fair walk from Wyn Manor and he was glad to have the bread and almonds to snack on while he walked. [PARAGRAPH]Bourne was set in a series of low hills between the Fellin river, which the north bridge crossed, and the much larger Arduro straight to the south. The straight was too large for a bridge so the south side of Bourne was dominated by docks and warehouses. To protect the city from flooding a levee was built among the docks with a series of maze like sewer tunnels beneath. Since its construction the building has since been turned into the city prison, though it still goes by its original name, the Drain. [PARAGRAPH]A wall now surrounded the Drain and provided some protection from flood waters but Mikel felt nervous each time he entered the prison. [PARAGRAPH]"Afternoon captain. " a guard said as Mikel approached. Still fairly new to his role Mikel was surprised to see the respect accorded him by junior guards. And the few guarding the prison seemed even more impressed as they stood formally and one unlocked the outside gate to let him in. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel headed through the gate and down the gradually sloping stone staircase. Lamps were set in the walls, and though the staircase was clean and dry, moisture beaded on the walls. [PARAGRAPH]At the end the stairwell opened to the prisons main processing room. Almost a dozen guards worked here and four main shafts lead out to the converted cells. [PARAGRAPH]"Are you captain Alaunus?" a guard asked. He was sitting at a desk beside a woman draped in a cranberry shawl. [PARAGRAPH]At the mention of his name many of the guards, who had been talking to each other or filling out papers, stopped working and looked up. But the woman didn't turn. She sat facing the guard that had called for him, with her back to Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes I am. " Mikel said crossing the room to the guard's desk, "I was hoping to speak with Cain. I have a few questions about his purpose here in Bourne. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course captain. " the guard said. "He is in tunnel C. But we may have a witness that saw the woman who was traveling with Cain last night. " The guard indicated the woman sitting at his desk. [PARAGRAPH]The woman looked to be both frail and fierce. Her shawl was gathered tightly about her in the cool dungeon. The hands grasping at it were gaunt, little more than skin worn thin by years pulled over gnarled bone. But her clear grey eyes refused to admit weakness. She was angry, or annoyed, or her scowl was permanently fixed on her face. It was not a face accustomed to smiling. [PARAGRAPH]"Hello ma'am. " Mikel said. "I'm captain Mikel Alaunus of the north bridge. I fought with the woman and her guards last night. They killed two of my men. Can you describe the woman you saw?"[PARAGRAPH]The woman didn't answer, she just stared at Mikel in a way that made him feel guilty, though he wasn't sure what for. The guard broke the silence, reading from his notes. [PARAGRAPH]"Fisher Lizabeth Konal," the guard started, once again indicating the woman, "said her son was at the Sparrow last night being chatted up by young foreign lady who matched the description of the woman on the bridge. Pretty, with dark hair and cloak that was so dark red it was nearly black. She said any man in the bar would have been happy to pay for her, and didn't know why she would be wasting her time on her dullard of a son. "[PARAGRAPH]Seeing Mikel's look of surprise the guard quickly added, "That's from her description, not from me captain. "[PARAGRAPH]"Did you see her closely?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes, I went in to yell at my son. " Lizabeth answered, "To get him to the docks to work a shift but he was rooted to the bar stool as usual. That witch glared at me. I've seen more warmth in a corpse's eyes. " Her voice was a thin rasp entirely suited for her angry face. [PARAGRAPH]"Can we speak to your son?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"If you can find him. He's been missing since last night. " she answered. [PARAGRAPH]"We already have two men out looking for him and a patrol out searching the area around the Sparrow. " the guard added quickly. [PARAGRAPH]"Why would she want to talk to your son?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"No idea. The boy is as useless as a painting to a blind man. " she said. [PARAGRAPH]The old woman didn't seem willing to offer anything further. [PARAGRAPH]"Any thoughts soldier?" Mikel asked the guard. [PARAGRAPH]"No captain. By all accounts Anton Konal, that's her son, was a large man. Maybe a good six to nine inches taller than you. He was a guard for a brief time a few years ago but rarely reported to his shift and was let go. Now he spends his time drinking in the Sparrow, passed out on its floor or working as a dock hand. Fisher Konal's assessment of her son seems accurate. It's unlikely he is a secret Sheaim contact in the city, or of any real use to anyone. "[PARAGRAPH]Then, as if forgetting he was speaking in front of Anton's mother the guard added, "Sorry ma'am". [PARAGRAPH]"All true," she said. [PARAGRAPH]"It does sound like her. " Mikel said, "I will ask Cain about it. Soldier, if the patrol turns anything up would you let me know? I will be stationed at the north bridge tonight. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course captain. " the guard replied. [PARAGRAPH]After thanking Fisher Konal, Mikel headed down into Tunnel C. Mikel walked passed rows of cells, some empty and others filled with a mix of pickpockets, prostitutes and drunkards. After walking to the end of the first row and down a spiral staircase, Cain's cell became obvious. There was a small group of people standing outside it. [PARAGRAPH]Two guards stood silent watch outside the cell, another pair was inside. There was a man in an orange waistcoat who Mikel recognized as a local speaker, and a Literal with pale yellow robes was tending to a small brazier that was burning incense. Lastly captain Cerron, the head of the prison stood looking into the cell. Cerron noticed Mikel approaching. [PARAGRAPH]"Captain Alunus, welcome to the Drain. I'm sorry I haven't had a chance to make it out to the north bridge and congratulate you on your promotion yet. " Captain Cerron said. [PARAGRAPH]"Thank you captain," Mikel replied, "I know you are busy and it's only a matter of time before all the sentry captains get to meet with you. I am only sorry we couldn't be meeting over a less tragic incident. "[PARAGRAPH]"Yes, this one is a mystery. And I'm sorry to hear about your men. My son trained with soldier Ruen, he was a good man. " Cerron said. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes he was. " Mikel said. "How is the interrogation going?"[PARAGRAPH]"We haven't gotten much out of him. " Cerron answered. "He claims he and his companions were cutting through Bourne on their way to Galveholm and he doubts either of them are still in Bourne. He says the woman's name is Gosea and the other man's name was Mahon. The Literal is preparing for the kiss of the innocent so we know if he is lying or not. "[PARAGRAPH]"Do you mind if I ask him a few questions?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Captain Cerron checked with the speaker and the Literal, neither of which had any objection. [PARAGRAPH]"But I will need your weapons before you enter the cell. Just in case. " Cerron said. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel removed his sword belt and handed it to the captain. Then one of the guards unlocked the cell as the others stood ready for Cain to move. But Cain sat on a bench in the back of the cell with his head down and his curly hair hanging in front of his face. He didn't look up even as Mikel entered the cell, crossed it and sat down beside him. [PARAGRAPH]The two men were similar in size with deep coppery skin. They both had black hair and similar tattoos across their chest, back and arms. The connection was not lost on Mikel who was so accustomed to looking different that sitting by a man that could have been his brother was unsettling. [PARAGRAPH]"Have they told you about the kiss of the innocent?" Mikel began. With no sound from Cain he continued, "They heat a coal on the brazier, then pray over it. When their prayers are complete they will put it in your mouth. If you have been honest the coal will not burn you. If you have lied, then it will burn your mouth and tongue so badly you will never speak again. "[PARAGRAPH]"Do you believe that?" Cain asked, his head still down. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel was surprised by the question. He knew many questioned the impact of the gods in the world, but this was a man who traveled with a witch who could drink the sound out of an area and another who could stand on the end of a spear without adding any weight to it. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course I do. I have seen it performed many times. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"I've have some experience with torture. This technique is also used among the Sheaim but without the religious trappings. I think it originally came from the Bannor. It works because a lying man is more nervous, his mouth goes dry and the coal burns him. An innocent man has more moisture in his mouth so he isn't burned. That's assuming the coal is prepared at the right temperature. If it is too hot anyone will be burned by it. I suspect your preparation ritual is all about getting it to the correct temperature, at least I hope it is. " Cain said, finally looking up at where the Literal was still praying over the brazier. [PARAGRAPH]"Have you been honest?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Why wouldn't I be? The worst I've done you already know. I killed a couple of your men. I assume you are going to kill me for it. Why lie?"[PARAGRAPH]"Do you know where your companions are now?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Cain ignored the question. Looking at Mikel he asked, "Why did you become a rooster?"[PARAGRAPH]"I fled Galveholm because I was on the losing side of one of the street wars. I ended up here by accident, but I liked it. It was a better life and they are good people. Lugus revealed himself to me and allowed me to become something more than the thug and murderer I was. " Mikel answered. "In fact, that night on the bridge I saw an angel. It healed my lieutenant and told me there was a disease in Bourne I was to help cleanse. But it didn't tell me how. "[PARAGRAPH]"Why do you suppose the gods never tell us the whole story?" Cain asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I think it's because your friends are the disease and you know where they are. So I already have everything I need. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"You are wrong, I have no idea where they are. Probably halfway to Galveholm. I think the gods don't tell us the full story because if we knew how things were going to turn out, we would never follow them. " Cain said. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel considered Cain quietly. He didn't believe Cain was lying, but Mikel had been softened by years living in Bourne. People here were horrible liars, they became nervous and talkative. Among the Sheaim many had no guilt lying or killing, and they talked emotionlessly about both. [PARAGRAPH]"Your friend lived?" Cain asked. [PARAGRAPH]"My lieutenant, yes. The angel healed him. " Mikel answered. [PARAGRAPH]"Mahon isn't going to be happy about that. He likes to claim anytime he swings his axes, someone dies. As far as I know it has always been true. "[PARAGRAPH]"Do you think he will stay in Bourne long enough to kill Ceth?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"No, he will do what Gosea wants. And she is too practical to care about Mahon's streak or a guard that got away. " Cain said. [PARAGRAPH]"Any idea why Gosea was at a bar last night chatting up a local dock hand?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]For the first time Cain looked surprised. When Mikel asked again Cain denied knowing why she would be there, and this time Mikel was sure he was lying. Despite Mikel's attempts to get any more information Cain wouldn't talk. Hearing about the bar visit had scared him, or reinforced his loyalty. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel stayed long enough to watch the Literal place the coal in Cain's mouth. Though Cain attempted to take it willingly, to get the test over with quickly, his fear overcame him at the last second and he had to be restrained by the guards and the coal forced into his mouth. [PARAGRAPH]Cain was uninjured by the coal beyond some minor burns. It was enough for the Literal to proclaim he had been honest in all his answers. Mikel doubted that was the case. [PARAGRAPH]But it was getting close to time for the night shift. Though he felt like he hadn't gained any usable information Mikel thanked captain Cerron and headed out of the Drain on the long walk to the north bridge. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 6[PARAGRAPH]Anton Konal had been burning for nearly twenty hours. [PARAGRAPH]It hadn't been hard to lure him to the empty silo, he followed Gosea without complaint. Even though he towered over the petite witch, he hadn't tried to force himself on her. Instead he begged and offered clumsy compliments in an attempt to seduce her. Gosea was disgusted by him. [PARAGRAPH]The hard part was finding a place for the sacrifice. Since it was early spring many of the silos along the docks were empty, and Mahon found one large enough to construct what they needed without anyone seeing the fire. Gosea's magic would take care of the screams. [PARAGRAPH]Once Anton arrived Mahon tied him to the large post in the center of the empty silo. Anton was forced atop a pile of refuse from the docks, splintered crates and barrels, planks and rope. All were coated with lamp oil. [PARAGRAPH]Gosea lit the flames and they stood in perfect silence as Anton writhed in pain. The fire consumed his feet then up along his legs. His skin peeled and blackened, revealing thick layers of fat beneath that burned and melted like candle wax. There was so much fat on him that hot, liquid streams of it crawled down his legs and dripped hissing into the fire. [PARAGRAPH]In time he stopped screaming, but Gosea's magic wouldn't let him die. His voice was gone and the flames had eaten away all the unnecessary parts of him. Anton's massive frame, blackened and burnt, was little more than bones covered with thick muscle. [PARAGRAPH]That was when the ritual changed. Instead of being consumed by the fire Anton's body began consuming it. Mahon poured more lamp oil on the fire until the flames were as high as Anton's waist but Anton seemed empowered by it. The fire greedily licked at Anton's chest, arms and shoulders. It was absorbed and drawn into him. And over time a hot orange glow came from within his chest, and behind his eyes. [PARAGRAPH]There he stood, eyes fixed on Gosea in passive supplication. He was no longer alive, but unable to die. His most basic animalistic desires were tethered to his body by Gosea's spell. When the ritual was done Mahon cut him free and what had been Anton lumbered off the pyre, ready to receive Gosea's commands. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 7[PARAGRAPH]The midnight bells rang through the city. Dawn and noon were sacred times in Bourne, even dusk was seen as a time of reflection and rest. But there was little comfort in midnight. In the well ordered city this was the one time when strange things happened. And it was when the two guards standing attention at the Drain's outer gate spotted Anton Konal's corpse lumbering toward them. [PARAGRAPH]A cloak had been placed over him, but it was nearly burnt off. His body glowed like a coal, his skin and muscles were charred and black, but beneath the guards could see slivers of orange fire. Though the body lumbering toward them was on fire it was more terrifying that the flames didn't seem to bother it. [PARAGRAPH]The guards yelled for help before grabbing their spears. Neither had any desire to get close to the creature. [PARAGRAPH]They waited until they heard other guards running up the stairs out of the Drain before attacking. One stabbed Anton's corpse, and the creature made no attempt to avoid the spear. It punctured Anton's large chest and slid easily through. Anton hurried forward, up along the spear and grabbed the startled guard. His thick hands closed on the guards throats and the guards strangled screams were mixed with the pain of burning hands on his skin. [PARAGRAPH]"Shields men!" captain Cerron called, racing up the stairs behind his soldiers. "Do not waste yourself on lethal attacks, the creature has no vulnerable organs. Lop off any piece that gets close to you. "[PARAGRAPH]Following their orders the guards with shields readied them and closed with short blades and axes. Anton turned and the spear that was still stuck through him spun wildly, but when Anton reached for another soldier he was blocked by a shield. One guard sliced across Anton's back with a sword, and another, with a lucky blow from his axe, severed Anton's hand. [PARAGRAPH]Anton roared in anger. The places where he had been struck burned with an angry orange light. [PARAGRAPH]"Be patient men, we will bring this creature down. " Cerron called, readying his own shield as Anton's attention turned to him. [PARAGRAPH]Anton charged, and though two guards stabbed him with spears he ignored both attacks. One guard was whipped around by the force of the charging giant, the other spear snapped in half. [PARAGRAPH]Cerron dove toward the creature's left side. Though Anton had no hand on that arm he beat it furiously against the captain's shield like a giant club. Cerron deflected the attack and returned his own, ducking low and chopping into Anton's knee with his axe. [PARAGRAPH]Despite the lack of pain, or the need for lungs, heart or mind even the walking dead still need their knees. As the kneecap splintered Anton fell onto the street. [PARAGRAPH]The guards were quick to take advantage of the fall. Cerron spun to deliver another blow to the back of Anton's leg, nearly amputating it entirely. A flurry of other attacks rained down on the creature's body, each leaving an angry hot scar in its place. [PARAGRAPH]Anton shuddered and then his body exploded. With a final howl the flames were released from the prison of his burnt corpse and they swept out over the guards, the Drain front gate, and the surrounding buildings. The cobblestones burnt and fractured in the heat, the bodies of the soldiers did much worse. Helmets were melted to flesh, exposed skin was burnt down to bone. Cerron and his men were killed. [PARAGRAPH]There were only two guards left in the Drain, and they fell easily to Mahon's twin axes. [PARAGRAPH]"Split up and find Cain. " Gosea ordered, throwing Mahon the set of keys from one of the guards. "Let out anyone you find along the way. "[PARAGRAPH]Cain heard the explosion and knew what it was. By the time Gosea found his cell he was standing at the bars calling for her. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you tell them about the heartstone?" Gosea whispered as she unlocked his cell. [PARAGRAPH]"No, and they didn't ask about it. " Cain replied. "They just wanted to know where you were. I honestly told them I believed you would be halfway to Galveholm. "[PARAGRAPH]Gosea studied his face with eyes that revealed none of her thoughts. Then she handed Cain an axe she had taken from one of the guard's corpses. [PARAGRAPH]"Let us go. We don't have much time. " Gosea said. [PARAGRAPH]On the way up to the main processing room Cain saw that most of the cells were open and the prisoners had fled out into the city. Outside of one cell where the body of a prisoner lay dead on the floor. Cain guessed the excitement at his freedom had caused the man to try to take liberties with his beautiful rescuer. He hadn't even touched Gosea before she had killed him for it. [PARAGRAPH]They called for Mahon from the processing room and he ran up to meet them. Any prisoners that weren't released yet were left in their cells. Together the three fled up into the city. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 8[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stood floating above the high white walls of Bourne as dawn struck the great city. Once an angel had stood at each tower, divine guardians of this sacred city. The moniker Bourne the Gleaming was not due to the white walls, but the holy power that once permeated it. [PARAGRAPH]But that was centuries ago. In time, and across generations, the city had faded. The compact only allowed the gods, and their agents, to act when empowered by mortal faith. And there was little of that left in Bourne. [PARAGRAPH]As an angel of the god of revelation Verchiel stood silent witness to the triumphs and failures of the city, though there was little he could do to help, guide or protect its people. But each morning he prayed that it would get better, that through their faith he would be able to stand with them, that he could do more than watch them in pain. [PARAGRAPH]As Verchiel looked over the grey city the sun began to creep over its walls and light up the few citizens that had got an early start on the day. A baker plodded along the alleyway, yawning as he went. A young man rushed home, still swaying clumsily from the night before. [PARAGRAPH]From the heart of the city the cathedral bells rang and people headed to service. Born by the light streaming across the city Verchiel arched across the sky and as it struck the golden symbol of the Empyrean on the great Cathedral window Verchiel was there beside it. [PARAGRAPH]Inside parishioners talked in the muted tones of morning. Luminary Rimmon prepared himself for the morning service, thinking through the news of the attack and the way to calm the city before everyone learned about the prison breakin and the deaths of the guards. The Luminary was a decent man, more pragmatic than philosophical, more politician than priest. And though Verchiel had tried to go to him many times, the Luminary was unable to see or hear the angel. [PARAGRAPH]As the service started there was a flash of light from within the city, east of the cathedral. Not the light of fire or anything physical, but the outpouring of faith, of the true power of Lugus, the god of the Sun. [PARAGRAPH]It is hard to surprise an angel that has been with the world since the sun first shone upon it. But Verchiel was, for a long moment, stunned. Then, cautiously, he swept down from his perch on the cathedral and flew over the streets of Bourne. The people seemed unaware of the welling power, they opened their stands, brushed off their walks, or hurried to work as Verchiel swept over them. Until he found himself over a small plaza near the docs. Warehouses were on all sides, and this was typically used as a place for traders to meet and work out deals with the various ships docked nearby. But there were no new ships in yet today and the plaza was deserted. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel could feel the power here, it strengthened him and he noticed that, much like the city, he had faded as well. But the source of the power wasn't here in the plaza, it was under it. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel slipped down through the cobblestones and dirt and into the city sewers. He had rarely seen them before, it was rare that men of faith would have a reason to be in such dark corners. [PARAGRAPH]A symbol of the Empyrean was traced in gold on the smooth stone of the sewer platform. Light poured through it like a beacon and lit the chamber, sending light into places untouched by it for centuries. In the distance rats squeaked in frustration as they fled the area, and quieter predators slipped into the murky channels nearby and disappeared. [PARAGRAPH]On the other side of the sewer platform there was another rune, this one made of silver and inside it sat a woman with dark, empty eyes and skin that has never felt the touch of sunlight. [PARAGRAPH]She began talking while Verchiel looked around. She was looking right at him, though Verchiel couldn't hear her words. Behind her two men slept, seemingly unaware of what was happening, and she hadn't thought to protect them with the circle she used around herself. [PARAGRAPH]"Deceit and manipulation are as unknown to me as compassion to the fallen. " Verchiel said, "I cannot hear anything you say if it is not true. "[PARAGRAPH]As the woman considered, Verchiel looked within her. He was accustomed to some reaction from mortals that saw him, seeing the divine can make the corrupt repent, the simple pious, can make the devout transform. Even the most worldly had been awestruck by his presence. But this woman showed nothing. [PARAGRAPH]He saw within her a girl who didn't speak her first word until she was 8. She was raised in an asylum in Galveholm, and thought to be cursed or touched or simple. She spent years staring into the shadowed corners of her room and whispering to imagined things. Her eyes were the empty hopelessness of those who threw themselves off the high walls of Bourn, who cut themselves and watched with cold detachment as their life flowed out of them. The most remarkable thing about this woman was that she was here at all, Verchiel could see nothing within her that would motivate her to leave that small closet room at the asylum. A part of her may still remain there. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel was interrupted from his study as she spoke. [PARAGRAPH]"I want you to guide the people of this city to let us leave. If we have to fight our way out more people will die. " She said. [PARAGRAPH]"How did you consecrate this place?" Verchiel asked, ignoring her statement. [PARAGRAPH]"I didn't. " she said, "I opened a way to the Dies Diei, it is its light that you see, and feel, reflected here. "[PARAGRAPH]"And who are you?" Verchiel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I am Gosea the Dwindling, sorceress of Ceridwen. " She said. She said something after but it faded to nothing to Verchiel's ears, another lie. [PARAGRAPH]"Will you guide the city to let us leave?" Gosea asked. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel had heard of sorcerers trapping angels, but only in areas consecrated to the fallen. Bourne was no longer sacred, but he wondered if she thought it so weak that she could attack him, even beneath the city. [PARAGRAPH]"You are a husk, no different than the abomination you created from that poor dock worker. You are blind, afraid and alone. And you are dangerous. " Verchiel said. [PARAGRAPH]If his words had any effect on her, she didn't show it. "No," he continued, "I will guide them to stand against you and your queen. Faith opens our eyes, faith gives us courage and faith means that we are not alone. "[PARAGRAPH]With a thought Gosea extinguished the channel to Dies Diei. The light flickered out and the shadows rushed in to reclaim it. There was no attack from Gosea, she simply pulled her hood over her head and rested her chin on her palms while Verchiel slipped up through the top of the chamber and back into the daylight in the small plaza. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 9[PARAGRAPH]Gosea was still sitting in the runic circle when Mahon woke up. He stretched lazily and then stood up without bending his waist or using any momentum. He simply placed the soles of his feet on the floor and straightened his knees in denial of the fact that it should have been impossible to do so. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you commune with the dead?" Mahon asked, studying the circle. He had learned a little about sorcery while traveling with Gosea, but he didn't recognize any of the symbols she had carefully traced out. [PARAGRAPH]"No," she answered, "I spoke with an angel of Lugus, the one that sanctified this city. I was hoping we could skip this battle and get on to our task. "[PARAGRAPH]"I don't know much about angels. " Mahon said, "But I assume he didn't accept the offer. "[PARAGRAPH]"No. "[PARAGRAPH]"Should we be moving if he knows we are here? Can't he give someone a vision or commune with one of their sorcerers?" Mahon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I doubt there are any sorcerers talented enough to be able to see into the ether in Bourne. And holy men may be even rarer. The angel may be able to inspire those in his city, but they lack the faith to see or hear him, much as he might try. There are no miracles to be had in Bourne. "[PARAGRAPH]"I saw a miracle. " Cain said without moving. He was still on his bedroll, lying on his side and facing away from Gosea and Mahon. "The tower guard healed his companion, the one Mahon nearly decapitated. He prayed, and then it sounded like he was talking to someone. And his friend was healed. "[PARAGRAPH]"What was his name?" Gosea asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Mikel. " Cain said, "Captain Mikel Alaunus. "[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 10[PARAGRAPH]Just before dawn the next morning Mikel stood before the Cathedral of Bells. Ceth and Deirdre were with him. Deirdre was carrying Anna, who was slumped asleep on her mother's shoulder. [PARAGRAPH]All three were surprised to see that the cathedral was flooded with worshipers. And though it was the largest temple in the city, there were far too many people clamoring in front of the temple to get inside. [PARAGRAPH]"What's going on?" Deirdre asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know. " Mikel said, "Ceth, can you see if you can find Knight Commander Marlowe? I don't know if we are going to be able to find open seats for the service. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel and Deirdre waited outside and watched the crowd as Ceth tried to find Marlowe. At first Mikel wondered if the crowd may have gathered because of his vision. But these people seemed nervous and afraid. Judging by their clothing, many were from the docks. [PARAGRAPH]A few Literals came out of the temple and began to organize the crowd into smaller groups for prayers and sermons in the open square. Mikel was considering joining one when Ceth poked out of the cathedral and waved for Mikel and Deirdre to join him. [PARAGRAPH]"Marlowe has seats reserved for us. " Ceth said when they reached him. [PARAGRAPH]They followed Ceth into the cathedral. Compared to the small Fenestran temple the cathedral was a palace. A high arched foyer was decorated with candles and organ music from the nave could be heard echoing throughout. [PARAGRAPH]The nave was huge and shaped like an amphitheater, with two rows of balconies overlooking the main floor and a central stage where seven thrones faced a long, marble altar. Unlit candles wreathed the stage. Behind the stage a staircase seemed to ascend into a gold, topaz and amber sun design, but actually led to the cathedrals presbytery . [PARAGRAPH]"Luminary Rimmon would like to speak with you before the service. " Ceth said. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel followed Ceth up the cathedral's central aisle and onto the stage. Mikel felt the eyes of the crowded cathedral on their backs as they walked across the stage. It wasn't unusual to have guards in attendance, even in full uniform, but it was unusual to have them going to speak to the Luminary before the service. [PARAGRAPH]Knight Commander Marlowe was in the shallow preparation area behind the stage talking with Luminary Rimmon and a few Literals. Ceth and Mikel stood a respectful distance away until Marlowe waved them over. [PARAGRAPH]"Speaker Rimmon, allow me to introduce the soldiers I told you about. This is captain Mikel Alaunus and his lieutenant Ceth Kiln. " Marlowe said. [PARAGRAPH]"It is a pleasure to meet you captain. " Rimmon said, grasping Mikel's hand. Rimmon was a powerfully built man for a priest; he would be as comfortable on the battlefield as he was within the cathedral. His pale yellow robes and glittering necklace of sunstones contrasted with his short, practical hair and callous hands. [PARAGRAPH]"It is an honor. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"And you as well lieutenant Kiln. " Rimmon said, turning to Ceth. "Are those scars from the attack," He examined Ceth's neck, "and that were healed by the power of Lugus?"[PARAGRAPH]"Yes eyeman. I mean, yes Luminary. " Ceth said turning a bit red in the face. [PARAGRAPH]Rimmon smiled. "Eyeman is fine. You can even call me Rimmon if you want, though I have yet to meet a soldier that will do that. "[PARAGRAPH]After he was finished examining Ceth's scars Rimmon added, "And you captain Alaunus, you saw the angel?"[PARAGRAPH]"Yes Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"What did the angel look like?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"He appeared to be the angel from one of the stained glass windows in the Fenestran temple. Literal Edain identified him as Verchiel. He had skin like yellow glass with light shining through it. He appeared as a stained glass window come to life. " Mikel said. Mikel was sure that Rimmon had already heard the details of his vision, though it seemed he preferred to get an account directly from Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]"And what did he tell you?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"That there is a sickness within Bourne. That I can stop it if I have faith. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]Rimmon considered Mikel closely, much as he had investigated Ceth's scars. "Have you heard about the attack last night?"[PARAGRAPH]Mikel and Ceth exchanged concerned looks. [PARAGRAPH]"No Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"I'll let Marlowe fill you in on the details. " Rimmon said, "But the city is in a panic and I intend to use your vision to help bring calm. The people need to know that Lugus cares for us, that he is protecting us. Do you agree with that?"[PARAGRAPH]"Yes of course Luminary. " Mikel said, though he wasn't sure how he felt about his vision being used for propaganda. Or how protected the city really was if there had been an attack last night. [PARAGRAPH]After a pause Rimmon added, "Is there anything you left out of your story? Anything you would like to clarify? This is the time for brutal truth captain. "[PARAGRAPH]"No Luminary. " Mikel said, "I take the mandate of truth very seriously. It is exactly as I said. "[PARAGRAPH]"Very good captain. I don't mean to question your integrity, but before a sermon I have to make sure everything I say is true. I hope you understand. " Rimmon said. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]At that they were ushered to their seats. Marlowe had some set aside in the first balcony. There was even a seat reserved for Anna, though she preferred to sit on her mother's lap. [PARAGRAPH]"What was Luminary Rimmon like?" Deirdre whispered as they waited for the service to start. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know. " Mikel said, "He seemed worried about the city. "[PARAGRAPH]The touch of dawn light on the windows signaled the beginning of the service. Literal's funneled in from the foyer, each carrying a tall candle. As one they lit the candles around the stage, bringing the cathedral to light. [PARAGRAPH]Luminary Rimmon came up from the back of the stage with a large tome in his hands. He set the tome on a stand and then thanked the Literals, who bowed slightly and retreated to the edges of the room. [PARAGRAPH]"Another day has come, another promise has been kept. " Rimmon said. Then he paused, looking out at the assembled faces and down at his notes. Seeming to abandon his notes Rimmon spoke directly to the room. "We were attacked last night and eleven guardsmen were killed. In the docks some buildings caught fire and nearly three dozen prisoners escaped from the Drain. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel and Ceth looked first at each other and then at Marlowe, who returned their looks with a slight nod. They seemed to be the only ones in the room who didn't know about the attack. [PARAGRAPH]"Captain Cerron was one of the men killed. " Marlowe whispered. [PARAGRAPH]"Did Cain escape?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Marlowe nodded again. [PARAGRAPH]"It was a horrible night. " Rimmon continued. "But it is day now, and Lugus has not forgotten the people of Bourne. Many of you have heard rumors of a miracle on the north bridge, and I can tell you that it is true. An angel saved the life of a guard near death and delivered a message to one of our captains warning us of the coming danger. "[PARAGRAPH]There were audible gasps from the audience. [PARAGRAPH]"That captain is with us, Captain Mikel Alaunus. As well as the man the angel saved, Lieutenant Ceth Kiln. " Rimmon gestured toward where Mikel and Ceth sat on the balcony and everyone in the temple craned to see them. "Lieutenant Kiln still carries the scars from the attack but he has recovered. The city of Bourne is unchanged. "[PARAGRAPH]Rimmon continued with his sermon, comforting and encouraging the audience to stand firm, to carry a message of hope out to the city. But Mikel lost track of his words. The angel Verchiel was walking down the center aisle of the nave, and no one seemed to notice. [PARAGRAPH]The angel's wings were spread, and exactly as he had appeared before his skin seemed to glow like the sun through honey. In his left hand he held his familiar crescent shaped shield, but in his right he held a sword that burned with a perfect golden fire. [PARAGRAPH]The light from Verchiel was nearly blinding. It reflected from every surface in the cathedral and yet no one turned to look at him. When he walked between the people and where they sat looking at Rimmon they continued to look straight ahead. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stopped at the front of the aisle, directly in front of Rimmon. If anything Rimmon may have squinted his eyes in the light, but he continued his sermon and ignored the angel. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel looked at Dierdre and Ceth, but neither seemed to notice the angel. They both sat contentedly listening to Rimmon's sermon as the angel turned and walked to the edge of the room, where a single Literal stood watching the sermon. The Literal was an old woman, as old as Mikel had ever seen working at the church. She was thin, with grey hair and age spots on her wrinkled skin. Her face was etched with wisdom and sadness. And Mikel was sure she could see the angel. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stopped in front of the woman and spoke to her. Mikel couldn't hear the angel's words, but they sounded compassionate and kind. The woman's eyes filled with tears, then she looked away and hurried out of the cathedral. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel's light dimmed with her loss. Then with a great flap of his wings Verchiel took off into the open air of the cathedral and soared toward where Mikel was sitting in the balcony. He landed easily on the balcony rail, just in front of Dierdre, though she continued to stare through him at Rimmon just as the rest of the room was. [PARAGRAPH]"We are at the center of the sickness. I will show you that which blinds others. " Verchiel said. [PARAGRAPH]And with that the world changed to one painted in grays. Around him the ghost-like figures of the cathedral dreamed, whispered, cried or simply sat apart from the world around them. Though an angel, who retained his radiant orange and yellow colors, stood a few feet from them they didn't see him. [PARAGRAPH]"Why can't they see you?" Mikel whispered. [PARAGRAPH]"Fear, ambition, apathy. " Verchiel said, "In some cases even hope or love can bind them. Anything that can keep a man from fully trusting the divine. I have stood eternal guard over them and the city, and in too many cases I have been forced too only watch as they have suffered. I can touch upon the power of Lugus, but only as the faith of man allows. "[PARAGRAPH]"How can that faith be restored?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"We must pierce the darkness. " Verchiel and Luminary Rimmon both said at once. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel was momentarily confused by hearing the two voices together, but Rimmon continued with his sermon, unaware he had answered Mikel's question or had spoken in concert with an angel. [PARAGRAPH]"What can I do?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Tell your command to maintain the guards at the gates. Although they are dangerous, one of their number is injured. One of them could escape at any time by walking across the river. But the sorceress is weakened in this city, her strength will not return on this ground and she will not escape unless we allow it. "[PARAGRAPH]With that Verchiel was gone and the cathedral dropped back to the normal colors of the world, though to Mikel's eyes they seemed more drab after watching the angel. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel listened and prayed as Rimmon finished the sermon, offerings were accepted and the crowd seemed more generous on the eve of the tragedy, or more hopeful to buy some of Lugus's goodwill. [PARAGRAPH]After the closing prayer everyone rose and began funneling out of the cathedral. Mikel touched Deirdre's arm as she was about to leave. [PARAGRAPH]"Go home. " Mikel said. "I have to speak to Marlowe, I will be home soon. "[PARAGRAPH]"Come home with us. " Deirdre said, pulling at his shirt. "You have already done so much. "[PARAGRAPH]"I'll be home later. " Mikel said, then softening he kissed his wife and his daughter. "I will be okay. "[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre looked ready to argue but she let it go. She whispered something to him, but it was lost in the surrounding voices and then she was gone in the crowd heading out of the building. [PARAGRAPH]"Knight Commander," Mikel said, "may I speak with you and the Luminary Rimmon again?"[PARAGRAPH]Marlowe looked surprised, but he nodded and Marlowe, Mikel and Ceth worked their way against the crowd and down to the altar where Rimmon stood comforting a few of the parishioners that had approached him after the service. [PARAGRAPH]Intimidated by the arrival of the soldiers the parishioners said a quick goodbye and left Rimmon alone with them. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes Captain?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel became suddenly self-conscious, he looked around to see if he could see the angel, but Verchiel was gone. [PARAGRAPH]"The angel spoke to me again, during your service. " Mikel said. Ceth's eyes widened and Marlowe looked nervous. If Rimmon showed any emotion it was only a slight pursing of his lips. [PARAGRAPH]"And what did he say?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel relayed the story as he remembered it, from the vision of the gray cathedral full of parishioners wrapped in their own worries, to the warnings about watching the gates and continuing to look for Gosea and her companions. [PARAGRAPH]Rimmon listened to the whole story and considered his words carefully before asking, "Why do you think an angel would tell you to have us do something we are already doing?"[PARAGRAPH]"I don't know Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"Why do you think the angel delivers these messages to you instead of," Rimmon paused here, picking his words carefully, "more senior members of the temple?"[PARAGRAPH]"I don't know Luminary. " Mikel answered again. [PARAGRAPH]"Your vision and the people in this cathedral that couldn't hear the angel because of their more earthly concerns, did that apply to me as well?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel began to answer that he didn't know again. But he did know, and he again thought of his vows and the Mandate of Truth. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes Luminary, I believe it did. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel kept his eyes down on the floor, he didn't want to know what expression was on Rimmon's face. [PARAGRAPH]"Is there anything else captain?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"No Luminary. "[PARAGRAPH]With that Rimmon turned and walked back across the stage and into the presbytery. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 11[PARAGRAPH]It was a long walk back to Wyn Manor. Mikel had said goodbye to Ceth and Marlowe at the Cathedral of Bells and he kept his head down as he walked across the city. A few people called out to him as he passed, even some he didn't know and he half-heartedly returned their calls. [PARAGRAPH]He entered the Wyn manor kitchen as he had before, the kitchen smelled good and there was a fresh plate of bread and cheese sitting on the table. [PARAGRAPH]"Diery?" AnnaSophia called from upstairs. [PARAGRAPH]"No," Mikel called back, suddenly shaken out of his dark thoughts, "It's Mikel. Did Deirdre leave?"[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia came into the kitchen and her expression answered Mikel's question. Before she said anything he was back out the door and running toward the small house he shared with his wife and daughter. [PARAGRAPH]She wasn't supposed to go home alone, but maybe she forgot something. Maybe Anna wanted one of her toys. There is no chance that, out of all of the people of Bourne, Deirdre and Anna would run into Gosea. But somehow Mikel knew that was exactly what happened. Cain knew who he was. Everyone in the city was talking about them, it wouldn't have been hard to find out he had a wife and daughter. [PARAGRAPH]By the time he reached his house his world began falling apart one piece at a time. First the note pinned to the front door with a hairpin like Deirdre wore. He opened it with shaking hands. [PARAGRAPH][PARAGRAPH]Mikel,[PARAGRAPH]Order your men, claim a vision, do whatever you need to do to draw the guards away from the harbor gate tonight. If you do so, we will leave the city without incident. If you don't we will sacrifice your wife and your sweet daughter to Ceridwen, the breaker of men, and then kill many more on our way out of your dusty city. [PARAGRAPH]The choice is yours. Cain hopes you deny us, your wife reminds him of his own. [PARAGRAPH] - Gosea[PARAGRAPH][PARAGRAPH]Mikel was back at Wyn manor. He hadn't noticed the walk back, the city was a distant echo, a world apart from the prison of fear collapsing on him. AnnaSophia met him in the yard, and though she asked questions he couldn't understand them. He only held out the note as explanation. She read it and rushed him into the house. [PARAGRAPH]"Mikel, Deirdre needs you. Anna needs you. " AnnaSophia said, that at least echoed through to him. [PARAGRAPH]"I'm here. " Mikel replied, "I understand. " He tried to force the fear away. I need to get to the guard station, I need. . . to pray. "[PARAGRAPH]"No," AnnaSophia said, her voice perfectly calm, her eyes as focused and adamant as any knight commander. "You must do what they want. "[PARAGRAPH]"I cannot forsake Lugus. " Mikel said, "He will protect Deirdre and Anna, he will protect us if we remain faithful. As he did with Ceth. "[PARAGRAPH]"I have lost one faithful family member in Lugus's service already, I will not offer up my daughter and granddaughter!" AnnaSophia nearly screamed, her resolve falling apart like shattered glass. "Do you imagine that the faithful never fail, that they never suffer, that they never die? That I didn't once tell myself that Lugus would protect what I loved and bring him home safe? You can bring her home safe, you are the only one. "[PARAGRAPH]"Let me pray. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 12[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel knew Deirdre and Anna were being held in an abandoned workshop near the docks. He knew that Cain was watching them and that if the guards rushed the building they could save them before Cain could kill them. But there was a reason Gosea had taken Mikel's wife, she didn't know if she could control him, but she knew she could destroy him. And now Verchiel watched the small flicker of Mikel's faith, that gateway that allowed him to speak to Mikel, go out. [PARAGRAPH]Though Mikel prayed, though tears ran down his face and he desperately wanted to hear, and though Verchiel stood beside him in spirit, with tears streaming down his own face, that vast chasm of fear and doubt kept them apart. [PARAGRAPH]"Your desire to be faithful isn't enough. " Verchiel whispered. "You must give up your fear, you must place your faith in Lugus and I will make you a beacon that will drive away the night. "[PARAGRAPH]But Mikel couldn't hear him. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 13[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia hands only trembled a bit as she sipped her tea. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you get an answer?" she asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel stood up, still stunned as he had been ever since he saw the note, but he no longer had the delusion of a quick solution. [PARAGRAPH]"No, I saw the angel before, he talked to me, I don't know why he won't come now. "[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia didn't offer an answer. [PARAGRAPH]"I love my city, I love my religion and I love Lugus. " She said carefully. "But there is a limit to all things. Maybe I'm weak, but we can't sacrifice the people we love for our beliefs. It doesn't serve Lugus to let them die. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel picked up the note and headed out the manor's front door. [PARAGRAPH]"Are you going to save them?" AnnaSophia asked. [PARAGRAPH]He stopped in the doorway with his back to her. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know. " Mikel said, it was all he could offer before he headed out into the street. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 14[PARAGRAPH]Mikel met Commander Marlowe and Luminary Rimmon at the Cathedral of Bells. The vaulted ceilings of the cathedral had never seemed more empty, and though they stood close together and talked in hushed tones in the empty cathedral, their voices echoed back them in conspiratorial whispers. [PARAGRAPH]"I know what they are going to try to do. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]Marlowe hadn't questioned Mikel's request to meet at the temple with Rimmon. Both men could see the concern and panic on Mikel's face and in his voice. Though they waited, Mikel didn't say anything. [PARAGRAPH]"Is Deirdre okay?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel's head fell into his hands. "No Luminary, she's not. They took her and Anna. I don't know where they are. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel explained the note and the threat as they listened. [PARAGRAPH]"Maybe we are best to let them flee the city, and we will have the best chance to save Mikel's wife and daughter. Commander do you really think you could stop them if they wanted to fight their way out? The witch's power is considerable. " Rimmon said. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know Luminary. " Marlowe answered. "But they have killed my men, our brothers, I still have families to meet with. Though more may die, I cannot simply let them go unavenged. "[PARAGRAPH]"What are your thought's Captain? Am I to assume that you wish to fight the battle since you declined their offer to mislead us?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I am bound by the Mandate of Truth. " Mikel said, "And I remain devote to the sun, even during deepest night. What if we pretend to abandon the gate?"[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 15[PARAGRAPH]Mahon slipped in the small home through a panel in the roof, falling to the floor with the grace of a dancer stepping from one step to another. [PARAGRAPH]"Did they clear the gate?" Gosea asked. [PARAGRAPH]"They are pretending to. Soldiers are disguised as commoners, some are hidden in the gatehouse. The chains inside the gate hang unlocked, but they have attached another set on the other side of the gate. "[PARAGRAPH]"What needless sacrifice. " Gosea said, mostly to herself. "Cain, kill the mother and child. "[PARAGRAPH]"Does it matter?" Cain asked, and though Gosea's dark eyes didn't reflect any irritation at his question, she did study him closely. [PARAGRAPH]"I assumed we would kill them either way. " Mahon said as he settled on the couch. [PARAGRAPH]"It's a spiritual game we play. " Gosea answered. "If the captain would have betrayed his city and god, then I have no need for his family, he is broken. But if he has chosen to trust his faith, then I cannot allow that fire to burn at our back. I cannot have his faith rewarded or we risk a new enemy for Galveholm. "[PARAGRAPH]"If we kill his family, he will be an enemy of Galveholm. " Cain said. [PARAGRAPH]"A man of faith can do more than an army of soldiers. He is useless broken. Kill his family. "[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 16[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel dropped to his knees and cried. He was an angel of Lugus, lord of the dawn and revelation, but he was unable to deliver his message. He knew where Mikel's wife and daughter were imprisoned, Verchiel was kneeling beside them in the ether. But Mikel was too full of fear and doubt to hear the angel's voice. Even now the witch and her guards were in the small homes common room planning to kill their prisoners. Deirdre and Anna had only a few minutes left to live. [PARAGRAPH]"Why are you crying?"[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stopped in surprise. He looked up to see see the innocent face of Anna looking at him quizzically. [PARAGRAPH]"Can you see me child?" Verchiel asked, equally puzzled. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course. " she said, "What is your name?"[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre sat staring at the iron bound door of the cell as she had since she was taken. The room was an old cellar and still had a pile of old tools and supplies in it. She had been through it a dozen times but there was nothing that could help her escape. She tried to stay strong and save her tears for when her daughter wasn't watching. She was so lost in her thoughts it took her a minute to realize Anna was holding a conversation with an old broom. [PARAGRAPH]"Chipmunk, who are you talking to?" Deirdre asked. [PARAGRAPH]Anna smiled, "His name is Verchiel, he's an angel and he will help us get back to daddy. "[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre had no words. At three years old her daughter had gone crazy. Deirdre wasn't sure if she should be jealous of her daughters hope, or condemn her for it. [PARAGRAPH]"We need something shiny" Anna said, going through the pile of supplies. She finally found an old copper plate that seemed to satisfy her and she started cleaning it with the hem of her dress. [PARAGRAPH]Deirdre heard the door to the cellar open. It was barely an hour since they had been fed and an unexpected visit from their kidnappers couldn't be good. Deirdre pulled Anna into her arms and when she squirmed Deirdre told her to be quiet. [PARAGRAPH]There was a jingle of keys and the cellar door opened. Cain, the largest of the kidnappers, opened the door. He had his axe drawn. [PARAGRAPH]"Sorry" he said with some sympathy, "your husband's too stubborn for his own good. "[PARAGRAPH]At that Anna tore free of her mother's grip and stood protectively in front of her. She held the polished copper plate above her head and Cain stepped back slightly at the sudden move. Nothing happened. [PARAGRAPH]Then Anna asked the broom, "What do I say?"[PARAGRAPH]"Come on. " Cain said. "There's no joy in killing a child. But you won't be my first. "[PARAGRAPH]"You cannot hide your actions" Anna shouted in a voice half her own and half unworldly, "Lugus will reveal all. If you mean to escape, then flee now into the darkness; this area has been claimed by the rose of summer!"[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre was stunned. But Cain wasn't about to be cowed by a three year with an old plate, and he stepped towards Anna. [PARAGRAPH]The copper plate exploded in light. It was as if Anna held the sun above her head. Cain covered his eyes in pain as light flooded the cellar, the small stairway and up in-to the home. Inside the house it rushed over Mahon and Gosea and broke free of every window or crack in the home's walls and spilled out onto the dark streets of Bourne and through the patchwork roof up into the night sky. [PARAGRAPH]Everyone in Bourne who had ever whispered a silent prayer to Lugus felt the stirring of holy power. The guards hidden at the harbor gate threw off their disguises and rushed to the home, as did the nearby watch and the local eyemen. [PARAGRAPH]Cain tried to stand against the waves of blinding light even though it burnt through to his closed and shielded eyes. He placed his axe in front of him and risked one peek at where he thought Anna was standing. When he looked he saw a golden angel standing before him with a blazing sword. [PARAGRAPH]"My arda is upon these two, you will not harm them. " the angel said. [PARAGRAPH]Cain raised his axe and pressed forward, but he was engulfed in light. Every darkness within him was undone, every cruel, pained memory swallowed like shadows chased out of a brightly lit room. Cain slumped back against the wall, his arms fell to his side and he dropped the axe on the floor. There were no memories left, and he stared up into the light with the innocence of a child. [PARAGRAPH]"It's okay. " Anna said as she stepped forward and took his large calloused hand in hers. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 17[PARAGRAPH]As the light exploded out of the small house's cellar Mahon and Gosea both fled out into the street. [PARAGRAPH]"Take the Heartstone. " Gosea said, pushing the delicately wrapped package into Mahon's hands. "Get it to Tebryn, get out of this city. "[PARAGRAPH]"I won't leave you alone. " Mahon argued. [PARAGRAPH]City guards carrying lanterns were already flooding onto the street, the site of the house still bursting with light caused them to pause briefly, but they would see Ma-hon and Gosea soon. [PARAGRAPH]"I am never alone. " Gosea said. "Get over the wall, now!"[PARAGRAPH]Mahon turned to look at the nearly 40 foot tall stone wall, "I'm going to need some help. " he said to himself. [PARAGRAPH]Gosea turned toward the guards and was careful to stay away from any of the beams of light streaming out of the house. [PARAGRAPH]"Sino, Vulnero, Dolor, Carcer, Ictus. . . " and on Gosea went, naming the myriad of spirits bound into her rings, runes and tattoos. At each name a spirit flew from her, a few, then dozens as her calls blurred together and became as wild and powerful as a storm at sea. Each spirit followed her command and jumped into the lanterns the guards carried, possessing the fire, gathering the oil about them and then leaping out onto the guards or the surrounding buildings. [PARAGRAPH]Guards screamed and rolled on the ground, but these flames couldn't simply be doused, they would leap off the guards and leap back. Guards tried patting each other down, or throwing their cloaks on each other, but it only caused confusion and the flames continued to dance among them. [PARAGRAPH]"Obey me" Gosea shouted as she flung her hands up over her head, away from the guards and toward the wall. As one, all of the flames streaked through the night air like dragonfire and struck the wall, sending oil straying in all directions, creating a pillar of thick, black smoke. But the wall had survived sieges, outside of some char marks it was unaffected. [PARAGRAPH]Commander Marlowe and Mikel reached the street in time to see the scattered guards still trying to understand what had happened. Marlowe immediately began shouting orders for the men to form up and prepare to rush the house, a squad was ordered to start triaging buckets of water and the injured were pulled back behind the lines. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel saw Gosea and Mahon standing silhouetted by the fire burning against the city wall. [PARAGRAPH]"Wait, Mikel. " Marlowe yelled, "They aren't going anywhere, they are trapped. "[PARAGRAPH]"No, they're not. " Mikel yelled back as he drew his sword and charged toward them. [PARAGRAPH]"Go!" Gosea shouted to Mahon. Spurred on by her words he sprinted toward the burning wall. Gosea turned to face Mikel, and her face was as pale and impassive as the moon. Even shadowed by the burning wall behind her Mikel could still see those immutable dark eyes. [PARAGRAPH]"Surrender!" Mikel shouted. [PARAGRAPH]Gosea didn't reply. Meaning to push quickly by her, Mikel dipped down, sweeping his sword low, below her arm and towards her thigh for a cut that would be painful, but not lethal. [PARAGRAPH]At the last moment Gosea moved toward Mikel, stabbing at him from a thin dagger in a hand that had appeared empty. The dagger went right through Mikel's arm, catching itself between the twin bones of the forearm and digging all the way through until its point poked out of the other side of his arm. This stopped his swing and she used his momentum, and her leverage to spin him around. [PARAGRAPH]Blinded by pain Mikel slammed the metal gloved fist of his other hand into Gosea's face. The witch's head snapped back, her nose shattered and her facial features swam as bones broke and gave way under the force. She let go of her knife and collapsed backwards onto the street. [PARAGRAPH]Nearly choking on blood Gosea spoke one more name, "Peractio. "[PARAGRAPH]A winged serpent the size of a man burst painfully up out of Gosea. Flowing from every part of her it filled her mouth, her nose, her ears and though she tried to scream, the serpent kept her from doing so. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel pulled the dagger out of his arm and switched his sword to the other hand just in time to block the serpent's first attack. Though his sword cut right across the serpent's body, the steel did not injure the demonic creature. [PARAGRAPH]The serpent lunged again and Mikel was forced to back up against the house. In the distance he could see Gosea struggling to get back up on her feet and the end of Mahon's sprint toward the burning wall. Instead of being stopped by the wall Mahon jumped up and stepped on the billowing smoke, riding it up and continuing to jump from black, ashy plume to plume to the top of the wall. [PARAGRAPH]With his back to the small house Mikel ducked another attack by the serpent and brought his sword up in a wide arch, an attack the serpent easily avoided as his sword plunged into one of the house's closed shutters. With his weapon trapped the serpent hissed, his eyes were cold, black and empty and for a brief second Mikel was lost in the utter lack of passion or rage in them. [PARAGRAPH]Then Mikel ripped the shutter off of the window and the serpent was bathed in the streaming white light bursting out of the house. The creature howled the sound of wind rushing down an endless pit and broke apart like oil consumed by fire. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 18[PARAGRAPH]Gosea was quickly apprehended. The enigmatic witch was gone, replaced by a scared young woman who cursed the guards, the city and Lugus loudly and with great fervor. Though riders were sent from the gate to chase down Mahon, he wasn't found. [PARAGRAPH]But it was Marlowe's voice that drew Mikel's attention. The soldiers had charged into the house, whose light was beginning to dim, and the commander's voice thundered above the burning fire, the screaming witch, and the growing amount of soldiers rushing into the square. It was a call of something more important than battle and demons and Mikel rushed to get to him. [PARAGRAPH]The soldiers parted as Mikel rushed into the house where his wife and daughter stood smiling and uninjured. Mikel swept them both up into his arms. It was hours before he let go of either of them. [PARAGRAPH]</English>
		<French>Gosea can channel spirits, usually demons, but has no ability to control them. Instead they possess her and use her as a puppet. She has power, but no will, and she is helpless to be anything but a victim to the forces that control her. [PARAGRAPH:4]Fideism[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 1[PARAGRAPH]Stained glass windows decorated the walls of the Fenestran temple. The windows were so large the walls seemed more glass than stone. The windows on the east favored yellow while those on the west side of the temple favored orange which caused the airy temple to change hue throughout the day. [PARAGRAPH]The temples dome was topped by a plain round window so at noon, as it was now, it was at its brightest. The light reflected off the temples polished bronze columns, leaving few shadows in the large room. The rooms focus was at its center where a pillar of light fell on a priest wearing pale yellow robes and the man that knelt before him. A small group of friends and family dotted the first few pews of the temple, a modest but proud turnout. [PARAGRAPH]"In duty and honor I consecrate this man to you dear Lugus, rose of summer. So that his life and spirit may be yours, to use and guide as you see fit. Bless him and keep him in your care as he remains vigilant to your will and that of the church. "[PARAGRAPH]"Arise Mikel Alaunus, new man of Bourne. " the priest continued. "As a humble servant of Lugus and this city I consecrate you as captain Alaunus, champion of the dawn, holy knight in the army of Bourne the Gleaming. Arise and accept the mandate of truth, throw your secrets away and join the revealing light of Lugus. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel stood. He was nearly a head taller than the young priest and his broad shoulders were evident even beneath the loose ceremonial tunic. His skin was the color of copper, as compared to the milky cast of the others in the room, and where his tunic fell low on his neck the black swirl of a tattoo could be seen. Mikel wasn't afraid of the mandate of truth, but public speaking, even to this small crowd, made him nervous. [PARAGRAPH]"I grew up in an orphanage in Galveholm, capital of the Sheaim empire. " Mikel began. "The orphanage wasn't like those here in Bourne. It wasn't a place to raise children, it was a place to store them. Galveholm is a brutal, violent city, full of promise and power for those willing to take it, and little protection for anyone else. "[PARAGRAPH]"I killed a man, a boy really, when I was twelve. His name was Augess and though he was only a year younger, he was small for his age. I struck out of habit more than any real malice, but he was angry at the way we treated him. He attacked me. He was in a rage, but still too weak to hurt me. I became angry too, and I killed him in the orphanage stairwell surrounded by the cruel cheers of the other boys. "[PARAGRAPH]"By the time I was fifteen I had killed two more. I was a murderer, an extortionist, a thief and a liar. My skill with a sword made me useful to cruel men. But when the man I worked for was assassinated, when others who worked for him began to die, I fled. "[PARAGRAPH]"I worked on caravans and ships before ending up in Bourne. I knew as soon as I saw this city I wanted to stay here. The cities high white walls, the battlements that seemed to be topped with gold and the cathedrals that dotted the city's skyline were all so different from the twisted towers and dark alleys of Galveholm. "[PARAGRAPH]"I was nearly arrested when I tried to enter the city. I am Sheaimic by birth and my tattoos are not only evidence of my past, but illegal in Bourne. After speaking with Gate Captain Marlowe he agreed to allow me my freedom if I worked on a local farm and stayed out of the city. I did so, working for Ferris Tawns, for just over three years. "[PARAGRAPH]"Ferris was a wonderful boss, and the years spent on his farm were my happiest to that point in my life. "[PARAGRAPH]Ferris and his wife, who were sitting near the back of the small group, didn't display any emotion at the praise. This wasn't simple appreciation, but a religious ceremony and everyone understood that regardless of what was revealed, the mandate of truth wasn't about those in the story, it was about the speaker. [PARAGRAPH]"I am ashamed to say I stole from Ferris while I worked from him. Though he shared his table with me, and paid me well I stole small things I could sell to traders on the road. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel was relieved to notice Ferris and his wife remained stoic. That was harder for him to admit than the murders. Failing after changing his life seemed like a bigger loss than the things he had done before. [PARAGRAPH]"Gate Captain Marlowe kept in touch with me and made sure his mercy was well placed. He eventually allowed me to travel with Ferris to the city's market to sell produce, and I enjoyed those trips. I befriended the market guards and when they were looking for new recruits, with Ferris and Marlowe's blessing, I applied. "[PARAGRAPH]"I have been working in the market for the past seven years. It was where I met my wife Deirdre, who I love deeply. We have been married for five years and four years ago we had a daughter, Anna. "[PARAGRAPH]Anna was unable to maintain the stoic expression and beamed at the mention of her name. Though Deirdre looked outwardly passive and listening, Mikel knew she was nearly as nervous as he was. The mandate of truth caused a lot of new knights to reveal past infidelities and crimes that sometimes destroyed families. Mikel was delighted he had no transgressions against his marriage, wife or daughter to admit. [PARAGRAPH]"Shortly after Anna's birth I began to feel drawn to the cities temples. Deirdre's father had been a knight commander in the church and gave his life in service to Lugus. My friend and fellow guardsman Ceth spent many shifts talking about his faith and the Empyrean . In time I began attending dawn rituals with him and my family. "[PARAGRAPH]"Three weeks ago I was offered the opportunity to become a knight in the service of Lugus and lead my own guard unit on the north bridge. I am undeserving of this honor, but I will give my devotion, my life, and my eternal soul, to the service of Lugus and to this city. "[PARAGRAPH]At this Mikel knelt again. [PARAGRAPH]The priest rubbed his thumb in a small pot on his belt, scooping out honey colored oil which he rubbed on Mikel's closed eyes. [PARAGRAPH]"Remember you carry the mandate of truth with you always. " the priest intoned. "Open your eyes to a world without deception, live your life revealed and without fear. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel opened his eyes. The oil burned and through the amber haze the bright temple appeared even brighter. Mikel could hear the people in the pews standing up and talking to each other, friends congratulating his wife. But he could only see a dizzying dance of light. The stained glass windows, once beautiful but lifeless, now glowed with an inner fire that made them seem alive. Angels and saints of the Empyrean looked down at him in full radiant glory. And one, an angel with a crescent shaped shield and a hand lost to golden light, seemed to float apart from the window. The angel looked down at Mikel with a look of passive benevolence. The angel reached out its burning hand, as if to touch Mikel on the forehead. But the light was too bright and although Mikel's eyes teared up as he tried to watch the vision, he was forced to blink and the room returned to normal. The angel was once again just a figure in the window. [PARAGRAPH]With one last look at the window Mikel turned back to the priest. [PARAGRAPH]"Thank you Literal Edain," Mikel said to the priest, "It is an honor I will give my life to uphold. "[PARAGRAPH]The priest smiled, but said nothing. [PARAGRAPH]"Is any sort of donation customary?" Mikel added quietly, embarrassed he was unaware of the protocol. [PARAGRAPH]"No my son," the priest said patting Mikel's hand. "You do a great service for our god. It is I who should be thanking you. Go and enjoy the day and your family. Though I expect to see you for morning devotions. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course eyeman . "[PARAGRAPH]The rest of the small group joined in congratulating Mikel. But Mikel found himself glancing back at the window that showed the angel with the crescent shield. After a few minutes Mikel was able to break away and ask the priest about it. [PARAGRAPH]"Literal Edain, who is the angel in the third eastern window?" Mikel asked. "The one with the crescent shield?"[PARAGRAPH]The priest stopped putting away the objects from the ceremony and looked at the window as if trying to remember. [PARAGRAPH]"I believe his name is Verchiel. Nearly sixty years ago, soon after this temple was first built, an occisor chased two children in here. A nine year old girl named Amelie and her brother, who was a few years younger. Amelie fell at the foot of the altar and prayed for help while her brother tried to fight the occisor. The boy was killed, but when the occisor went for Amelie, Verchiel protected her. The occisor fled from the temple and Amelie devoted her life to the Empyrean. "[PARAGRAPH]After a pause the priest added, "Why do you ask?"[PARAGRAPH]"The oil. . . " Mikel said clumsily, "I mean, I thought I saw that angel move during the ceremony. "[PARAGRAPH]"That is good. " Edain said, though Mikel couldn't tell if he was being patronizing or if visions like his were so common that the priest was unimpressed by it. Edain patted Mikel's arm and without saying more went back to storing the altar cloth in the small recess behind the altar. [PARAGRAPH]Deirdre approached the altar still beaming with pride at her husband. Anna followed her mother, anxious to hug her father but unsure if she was allowed to come close yet. Anna beamed up at Mikel with a smile identical to her mother's as he scooped her up in his arms. [PARAGRAPH]"My mother has a carriage ready, I think she is almost as proud of you as I am. " Deirdre whispered as she hugged Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 2[PARAGRAPH]At dawn the next morning Mikel was back at the temple. It was nearly full as the crowd went through morning devotions, alternatively sitting in quiet reflection, open prayer, and listening to Literal Edain speak. This morning Edain talked about Bridgit, the archangel of Bhall, who remained true to her goddess's mandate of divine passion even as Bhall fell to the whispers of Agares. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth sat on one side of Mikel, and Deirdre on the other. Anna sat on her mother's lap dutifully listening to the sermon, her eyes wide with wonder. She had blue ribbons in her blond hair, and in the yellow light of the temple her hair seemed to be made of gold. [PARAGRAPH]With a whispered blessing Literal Edain dismissed the congregation and almost as one the crowd rose to leave. Mikel interrupted the group funneling out to give his wife and daughter a quick kiss. [PARAGRAPH]"I will see you tonight. " Mikel whispered. Then to Ceth he added, "Can you wait for me? I want to speak to the eyeman. "[PARAGRAPH]Ceth nodded and stepped outside to get out of the way of those leaving behind him. After a hug Deirdre and her mother took Anna out into the city, already talking about their plans for the day. Mikel waited until the temple was clear before he approached Edain. [PARAGRAPH]"Eyeman, do you have a minute?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course. " Edain said sitting in the first pew and signaling Mikel to sit beside him. "What is it?"[PARAGRAPH]"It's about the mandate of truth. I have a question about when it is appropriate. "[PARAGRAPH]Edain sat passively, giving no indication if these sorts of questions were expected or unusual after someone has been through the ceremony. [PARAGRAPH]"I am a part of a lie, but it is not my secret. " Mikel said, "My mother-in-law believes I met Dierdre while working as a guard in the market, that I saved her from a thief. The truth is, we met when I caught Deirdre stealing from one of the merchants. "[PARAGRAPH]Again there was no indication if this surprised Edain or not. [PARAGRAPH]"I want to be honest with my mother-in-law, but I don't want to violate my wife's trust. What does the mandate of truth require of me? What does Lugus ask?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Edain offered a practiced smile. "The mandate of truth is a heavy burden. One that cannot be forced on any man, and must be accepted willingly. You cannot force your wife to live under its restrictions just because you do. To do so is to invite secrets between you, and the purpose of the mandate of truth is to live without secrets. "[PARAGRAPH]Edain paused before continuing. "But, you should encourage your wife to be honest in all things. This lie does not protect her, it traps her. One cannot change the past simply by saying it is not so. Speaking personally I have known AnnaSophia for many years, and I have no doubt she will have compassion for her daughter if she is told the truth. "[PARAGRAPH]"Yes eyeman. " Mikel said, "You are right. Thank you. "[PARAGRAPH]After another thanks Mikel headed out of the temple, where Ceth waited for him. They were a few blocks from the north bridge and the walk was a good way to warm up on the cold morning. [PARAGRAPH]The north bridge was unguarded during the winter. The few that crossed it were local farmers and traders, and even they were infrequent. But once the northern passes opened, activity would increase until it became one of the busiest bridges in Bourne. [PARAGRAPH]When it was built the bridge was wide enough that one of the aspen trees that grew along the rivers northern bank could have been laid across it. But since that time merchants had setup stalls on both sides of the bridge and there was barely room left for two caravans to pass. [PARAGRAPH]When Mikel and Ceth arrived the gates at both ends of the bridge were closed. Mikel unlocked each and turned to look at the empty stalls and the bridge tower. A deer stood in the woods at the north end of the bridge watching the two men. [PARAGRAPH]"Are we supposed to protect the city from the deer?" Ceth asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Laugh now, in a few weeks you will have more than enough work. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"By work you mean sitting by the tower watching caravans roll by, right?" Ceth said. [PARAGRAPH]"Right, and the occasional patrol up and down the bridge. But don't worry, we have some real work today. " Mikel said unlocking the bridge tower and opening it to stuffy room with a small jail, desk and armory. A nest of webs filled the corners of the room and the dried husks of rats hung in the webbing. [PARAGRAPH]"Today we clean. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"Then who is going to keep an eye on the deer?" Ceth said disgusted. [PARAGRAPH]The spider was nearly the size of a man's head, and both the men were glad there was no one else on the bridge to hear their screams as they chased and eventually killed it. They spent the rest of the day cleaning the tower. They accepted a small shipment of weapons and armor, stored them in the armory and then sat outside the tower and watched the river and the leafless woods beyond for the rest of the afternoon. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 3[PARAGRAPH]Just as Mikel promised, within a few weeks the bridge was alive with activity. All of the stalls were open with merchants hawking their wares to passing caravans, and it was rare to have a moment without at least one caravan on the bridge. The woods on the north bank were now green, the days were warmer and Mikel had ten guards, including his lieutenant Ceth, assigned to the north bridge and reporting to him. [PARAGRAPH]"Come down off my wagons!"[PARAGRAPH]The scream was angry, though it was easily lost in the chaos of people arguing over the price of goods, yelling for people to move out of the way of wagons and the sounds of various mules, oxen and chickens scattered over the bridge. [PARAGRAPH]"Guardsman!" an angry merchant yelled, looking at Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]"Captain," Mikel corrected, "and what can I do for you?"[PARAGRAPH]"There is a man, a thief, rooting through my goods. " the merchant exclaimed. He was a large man and his face was bright red with anger. He looked to be about to climb up onto the wagon where a wiry man poked beneath the tarps that covered it, if he could manage to lift his bulk up off the road, which didn't seem likely. [PARAGRAPH]"Greylin," Mikel called, "get off the wagon. I've warned you about this before. "[PARAGRAPH]"Mikel, tell him I'm no thief. I'm just checking to see what he has for sale. " Then turning to the red faced merchant Greylin added, "How much do you want for these radishes? I could take the whole batch off your hands. "[PARAGRAPH]Cutting off the merchant before he started to scream again, Mikel said "Now Greylin, or it's a night in the cell. "[PARAGRAPH]With a look of disappointment Greylin climbed down. "The real thieves are in the market, they won't pay anything for these goods. They don't offer fair deals to outsiders. Not like me, I respect a man who traveled all the way to Bourne. You don't have to be my cousin's sister's whatever to get a fair deal from me. "[PARAGRAPH]"Greylin is harmless. " Mikel said to the merchant whose face was returning to a normal color, "And he isn't a thief, though he is overeager. You won't have any more problems with him. " Mikel said this last point loud enough that Greylin could hear him. [PARAGRAPH]After making sure the merchant wasn't going to attack Greylin, Mikel headed back and sat down outside the guard tower beside Ceth. The two rarely had a chance to work together since Ceth was the bridge lieutenant and in charge of the bridge during shifts Mikel wasn't working. [PARAGRAPH]"Is it any better at night?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"It's not this crowded. But it's steady until dusk, then we get a rush of activity as people try to get into or out of the city. We never get the gates closed on time. " then Ceth added, "I was going to ask Donovan if he could work tonight. Fenton is sick, covered with boils if his wife is to be believed, and I'm down a man. "[PARAGRAPH]"Donovan is sick too, sounds like he may have the same thing. We only have three men on the bridge today. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"Think they may be all off drinking somewhere?" Ceth said half-joking. [PARAGRAPH]"I saw Donovan. " Mikel said, "He looked horrible. A bunch of people in the city have been getting sick, most get better in a few days. I can cover for Fenton, maybe I can talk Deirdre into bringing us some dinner. "[PARAGRAPH]"Are you sure? I can ask someone else. " Ceth said. [PARAGRAPH]"It's no problem, but you have to pay me back by sticking around and covering Donovan's shift for the rest of the day. "[PARAGRAPH]The rest of the day went smoothly. Just as Ceth described there was a rush of activity just before the gates closed and by the time the dusk bells rang throughout Bourne the gates were all still open. Finally a little more than an hour later they were closed and locked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel locked the guard tower and met Ceth for a final walk down to check in with the overnight guards on the north side of the bridge. Walking down they were surprised to see three figures walking toward them. It was too dark to see clearly but it looked to be a woman flanked by two men. One of the men was a bear of a man, thick through the chest and shoulders. He plodded forward with all the grace of a boulder rolling down hill. The other man was the opposite, he was almost lost in the silhouette of his cloak. A slight turn and this man stepped into the shadows of one of the merchant stalls and disappeared. [PARAGRAPH]"Halt. " Ceth called lifting his spear. The two figures they could still see continued walking forward as if they hadn't heard him. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel's hand went instinctively to his sword hilt. Something about these people worried him. The gate guards wouldn't allow anyone on the bridge after closing. And the way one of the companions disappeared spoke to a skill beyond simple travelers. Mikel hadn't even drawn his sword other than to care for it since being assigned to the bridge. He had used his sap a few times and sometimes threatened to use a short cudgel he carried. But this was the first time he was tempted to draw his sword. A blue ribbon tied around the swords hilt reminded him to stay calm. [PARAGRAPH]"Careful," Mikel whispered to Ceth, "there were three of them. "[PARAGRAPH]They were now close enough to see each other. The woman was the most notable, with pale alabaster skin that made her look almost ghostlike in the moonlight. She wore burgundy robes so dark Mikel first mistook them for black, her hair was long and black and her eyes were dark pools. She was beautiful, as long as you avoided her eyes, which were cold and empty. [PARAGRAPH]Her bearlike companion wore a horsehair cloak and worn leather armor. He held a thick double bladed axe casually in his hand, it dripped with a dark liquid. Mikel could see the swirl of black tatoo's sticking out from beneath his leather bracers. [PARAGRAPH]"Sheaim!" Mikel yelled, hand going to his sword. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth lowered his spear, pointing it threateningly at the woman as he stepped towards her. She ignored him, throwing her head back as if to howl. But instead of making any noise Mikel felt a sudden pressure on his ears and head that was so strong it made him dizzy. Not only did the woman make no noise, everything went perfectly silent. The sound of the wind blowing across the tarps over merchant stalls disappeared, the sounds of the river lapping against the bridges foundations was gone, only perfect empty silence remained. [PARAGRAPH]It was silent as the man with the double bladed axe walked towards Mikel. Silent as Ceth approached the woman. Ceth shook his head and looked at Mikel in confusion, whatever was affecting Mikel was affecting him as well. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel drew his sword in time to parry the axeman's attack. He could now see that the liquid on the axe was fresh blood, and he had little doubt it was from the overnight guards. This axeman could have been any of the kids that grew up in the orphanage with him. He had the same copper colored skin, and the same delight on his face at the opportunity to cause pain. [PARAGRAPH]But Mikel was not a simple guardsman grown soft settling disputes between merchants. With force the axeman wasn't expecting Mikel parried the axe and brought an armored elbow up hard against the side of the axeman's face. Suddenly the look of delight was gone, replaced by anger. [PARAGRAPH]The cloaked man that had slipped into the shadows came out. He stepped between Ceth and the woman, and when Ceth lunged with his spear he leapt up and landed easily on the end of Ceth's spear. [PARAGRAPH]There he stood, almost frozen, an axe in each hand and seemingly without affecting the weight of spear at all. Ceth stood unbelieving. First the silence and now this man stood on the tip of his spear as if balancing on a tightrope. The scene had an eerie dreamlike quality. [PARAGRAPH]Meanwhile the axeman Mikel was fighting continued to swing wildly. Mikel drew his cudgel in his left hand and it was quickly destroyed by the powerful axe. Another parry and an elbow to the axeman's face sent the axeman stumbling backwards, cursing soundlessly. Mikel didn't waste the opportunity and stabbed the axeman's exposed side, just below his kidney and through until stopped by the leather plate on the axeman's back. The axeman stumbled back further and fell, a dark pool quickly welled around the wound. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth tried to shake his spear, to knock off the man standing on it. But instead the man ran up the length of the spear. Coming up nearly to Ceth's hand the attacker swung his twin axes, catching Ceth's throat and sending a bright red arch of blood high into the air, some even struck Mikel, though he was over three meters away. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth went back, head down hard into the stone bridge. He dropped the spear and the man nimbly landed on the ground, turning toward Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]The woman stopped her silent howl and sound returned with another dizzying pop of pressure. [PARAGRAPH]"Leave him, run. " the woman said pointing toward the south end of the bridge. Together the two started running toward the city. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel fell at Ceth's side, ignoring the fleeing attackers and the axeman lying wounded on the bridge. Ceth's eyes were spinning wildly in fear and confusion, but they stopped when they locked onto Mikel's. He tried to speak but that only caused more blood to spill out of his open throat. Mikel clasped both hands over Ceth's throat, trying in vain to stop the bleeding, though blood continued to pour through his fingers. [PARAGRAPH]"Please, please, please. " Mikel whispered, trying to contain the horror rushing through him. A deep breath and his thoughts focused, his fear was gone. [PARAGRAPH]"Please, Lugus, lord of the dawn, do not forget us. " Mikel whispered, "Do not let him die. He has seen too few days. Share your mercy and your light with him. "[PARAGRAPH]There was a sudden heat through Mikel's fingers and he felt Ceth gasp. Opening his eyes Mikel saw Verchiel, the angel in the temple, kneeling on the other side of Ceth, mirroring Mikel's pose. Verchiel was praying too, and where the angel's hands passed through Mikel's he felt heat and power. [PARAGRAPH]Any shock or surprise was gone in this moment. Mikel only cared about saving Ceth and did not question the appearance of the glowing angel. Verchiel appeared much like a stained glass window, his skin was golden and slightly translucent and an inner light seemed to radiate from him. He wore modest white robes trimmed in yellow and he had the same crescent shaped bronze shield decorated with beautifully faceted gemstones. [PARAGRAPH]As the warmth faded Verchiel looked up into Mikel's face. "There is a sickness within Bourne. If you have faith we can heal the city. "[PARAGRAPH]"I do, I will. " said Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]At that Verchiel spread his wings, appearing exactly as he did in the window, and disappeared. [PARAGRAPH]"Mikel," Ceth said straining through Mikel's pressure on his throat, "what happened?"[PARAGRAPH]Mikel removed his hands to see two long scars on Ceth's throat. They were thick and bright red, but completely closed and the skin around the wounds looked fresh and healthy. [PARAGRAPH]"The angel healed you. " Mikel said, though he realized how strange those words sounded. [PARAGRAPH]Both men were broken out of their thoughts by the sound of the axeman Mikel had stabbed trying to get up. The axeman grabbed his side, weak from the loss of blood. Despite his obvious pain he was already standing and he raised his axe menacingly. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel rolled up and charged the axeman. Mikel's sword knocked the axe easily aside and Mikel set his shoulder low and into the axeman's chest. The axeman flew backwards, losing hold of his axe as he slammed into the side of a merchant stall and then fell hard against the ground. This time nothing silenced him and his cries were loud and profane. [PARAGRAPH]"I'll take care of him. " Ceth said picking himself up and grabbing his cudgel. [PARAGRAPH]"Are you sure you are okay?" Mikel said, but Ceth moved quickly, rolling the cursing axeman over and tying his hands. Despite the stains of blood on his neck, face and breastplate Ceth was completely recovered from the attack. [PARAGRAPH]"I'm going to warn the city guard, put him in the cell. " Mikel said. Then, without waiting for Ceth's answer, Mikel ran south along the bridge, chasing after the woman and the other attacker. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 4[PARAGRAPH]Mikel couldn't help feeling negligent in missing the next morning's dawn ceremony. As the morning bells rang out through the city he was sitting in a very crowded north bridge tower. Ceth was here as was Mikel's senior officer, Knight Commander Marlowe, and a crowd of other officers and priests. [PARAGRAPH]One of these priests was questioning the axeman, who gave his name as Cain the Torn, and who remained locked in the towers single cell. Mikel listened to the questioning as he and Ceth recounted their memories of the attack. [PARAGRAPH]"Cain, do you think your companions could have overcome the guard captain on their own?" the priest asked the prisoner. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes. " Cain answered. [PARAGRAPH]"Then why would you protect them if they abandoned you so easily? You would be dead if not for our care, left to die or be arrested while they escaped. There are two dead guardsmen, and nearly a third but for the grace of Lugus. Would you bear the burden for these crimes alone?"[PARAGRAPH]Cain didn't answer. He was still pale from the loss of blood and leaned against the cell wall. It was obvious the priest's persistent questions were having some impact on him. Seeing Cain wasn't going to respond the priest tried a different tact. [PARAGRAPH]"Cain, do you have a family. A wife and children?"[PARAGRAPH]"I did. " Cain answered, "I was much worse then. I lost control and killed them. "[PARAGRAPH]Cain seemed to be lost in the memory of the event. His answer quieted the rest of the people in the room, but the priest continued undeterred. [PARAGRAPH]"It is good you admit that. You would not want to die with that burden upon you. You can be forgiven, you can find peace. But this woman, she wanted you to continue killing, to use you. "[PARAGRAPH]"She. . . " Cain said looking up at the people in the room, "knows who I really am. "[PARAGRAPH]"It is not who you have to be. " the priest continued, "Your wife, she saw a different man. She knew who you really are. "[PARAGRAPH]"No," Cain said with emotion, "not until the night I killed her. That was the first time she really saw me. "[PARAGRAPH]The priest continued questioning but Cain didn't offer any further information, and nothing about his companions. Forgiveness and repentance may appeal to those raised in Bourne, but Mikel wasn't surprised the Sheaimic axeman was uninterested in the concepts. [PARAGRAPH]"This is a miracle. " Knight Commander Marlowe said placing his hand on Mikel's shoulder. "A vision, a warning and the life of one of our guardsman saved. This is a blessing not only to you but the city itself. It is an honor that Lugus would intervene. "[PARAGRAPH]"Yes sir. " Mikel said, "I feel like I should be at the dawn ceremony now, or out looking for the woman and the other man. "[PARAGRAPH]"A soldier always wants to be doing. But you are a part of the city, and without moving you are accomplishing both. Runners have been sent to all of the temples and guard stations in Bourne. The guards are all looking for them, and thanks are being offered in all the temples. " Marlowe answered. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel was surprised, he knew the runners had been sent to the guard stations, he had started that process last night. But knowing the priests were being told about his vision made him self-conscious. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth had it even worse. The priests were taking turns investigating the scars on his neck and treating him like a sacred relic. He had been choking on blood until, as if waking from a bad dream, the pain was gone. He thought he was dead except for the flood of cool night air in his lungs. Ceth hadn't seen the angel or known about it until Mikel told him. [PARAGRAPH]"Tomorrow why don't you and Ceth come to the dawn ritual at the Cathedral of Bells ? I am sure Luminary Rimmon would like to meet you. "[PARAGRAPH]"It would be an honor. " Mikel said, though the prospect of meeting the high priest of Bourne made him more nervous than the fight on the bridge. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth agreed to the invitation and the two stayed long enough to sign Cain over to the city guard, who would transport him to city prison. After stopping to give instruction to the day watch, Mikel set off for Dierdre's mother's manor. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel had sent a runner to Dierdre less than an hour after the fight, giving her a short explanation of what had happened and asking her to go to her mother's house to be safe. Mikel had ordered the runner to escort her to her mother's house. [PARAGRAPH]Dierdre's father had been a knight commander in charge of a thousand men. He died on the battlefield, giving his life for Lugus and Bourne in the autumn just after Dierdre's eighth birthday. Before he died he built the squat stone manor, now called Wyn Manor. [PARAGRAPH]The manor had four wings, but since Dierdre's mother AnnaSophia lived in it alone only the east wing remained open. Dierdre met Mikel as he entered the kitchen door the family most commonly used. AnnaSophia was in the kitchen behind her daughter pouring tea. Anna, who had tried to wait up for her father's return, had finally succumbed to sleep and was lost in a tangle of blankets on a couch in the adjoining great room. [PARAGRAPH]"What happened?" Dierdre said, unaccustomed to any change in the normal guard schedule. [PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia, whose marriage contained many mornings like this shooed her daughter away from the door and offered Mikel a seat at the kitchen table, which he gladly dropped into. Mikel didn't have time to speak before a cup of hot tea was placed before him, along with some dry rolls and a small pot of butter. [PARAGRAPH]"Thank you," Mikel mumbled as he ripped off a piece of bread and stuffed it in his mouth. [PARAGRAPH]Noticing Mikel was still covered with sweat and the spray of blood AnnaSophia went to wet a rag for him to clean off with. Before she could do so Dierdre also noticed the dried blood splattered line across his breastplate. [PARAGRAPH]"Is that blood?" Dierdre asked, her voice rising. [PARAGRAPH]"Quiet Diery. " AnnaSophia said, indicating where Anna slept. "Let Mikel eat a bit first, he is here and safe. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel quickly finished eating and washed the blood off his armor while he told both of the women what happened. Dierdre was stunned by Mikel's description of the angel and Ceth's healing, but AnnaSophia only listened carefully and waited until the story was complete to ask her question. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you tell anyone about your vision?" AnnaSophia asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes, of course, I told Knight Commander Marlowe and it was relayed to the guard stations and to the temples before dawn. "[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia's looked down, her brow furrowed, seemingly intent on the crumbs she was sweeping off the counter. [PARAGRAPH]"Do you think I shouldn't have?" Mikel asked. "Do you think I didn't really see an angel?"[PARAGRAPH]"I think you saw an angel. " AnnaSophia said quickly, "But I wonder how the church will accept your miracle and vision. These are rare events, it may be years before we hear of anything similar. What will the church expect of you because of it?"[PARAGRAPH]"They will know he is a hero. That the church did well to make him a captain. " Dierdre answered. [PARAGRAPH]"I am sure you are right. " AnnaSophia said, but she continued brushing off the counter though no crumbs remained. [PARAGRAPH]They talked for a few more minutes before Mikel's exhaustion began to catch up with him. After asking if he could borrow one of the guest bedrooms Mikel picked the sleeping Anna up off the couch and carried her into the bedroom where he placed her gently on the bed before collapsing beside her. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel's dreams where thick and muddy. The fight on the bridge mixed with those from his boyhood in Galveholm. He dreamt about Cain killing his wife and Herod Wyn, a man he had never met, who died in the service of Lugus leaving his wife widowed and his daughter fatherless. And though he searched in his dreams for another vision of the angel, it never came. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 5[PARAGRAPH]The noon bells woke Mikel. It had only been a few hours sleep, but it would have to be enough. He washed up before putting his armor back on. As he was putting his sword belt on he noticed his sword was still stained with Cain's blood. He took the sword out and cleaned it. [PARAGRAPH]The blood had even stained the blue ribbon tied around its hilt. Mikel felt suddenly angry he had been forced into a fight on the bridge, that they had attacked him and killed the other guards. That an angel had intervened and spoken with him, and that Ceth had been injured in the first place. He had hoped his days of sword fights were past. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel kissed Anna, who still lay sleeping peacefully on the bed, and headed down to the great room. [PARAGRAPH]Dierdre had taken her daughter's position on the couch and was snoring softly. AnnaSophia was still in the kitchen, though she peeked in when she heard Mikel before going back to her work. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel walked into the kitchen and saw she was packing a half loaf of bread, a bag of almonds and a fresh canteen. She set it out for him as Mikel entered the room. [PARAGRAPH]"Does this mean I'm leaving?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"If you stay I'll gladly cook you something better. But I don't think your coming downstairs for my cooking. " she answered. [PARAGRAPH]"No, you are right. " Mikel pocketed the food and the canteen then added, "Thank you for your help this morning. I was, I still am, overwhelmed. When Dierdre wakes up could you tell her to wait here for me and I'll come back tonight to walk her home. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course. " AnnaSophia said. [PARAGRAPH]With that Mikel headed out into the city on a walk to the city prison. It was a fair walk from Wyn Manor and he was glad to have the bread and almonds to snack on while he walked. [PARAGRAPH]Bourne was set in a series of low hills between the Fellin river, which the north bridge crossed, and the much larger Arduro straight to the south. The straight was too large for a bridge so the south side of Bourne was dominated by docks and warehouses. To protect the city from flooding a levee was built among the docks with a series of maze like sewer tunnels beneath. Since its construction the building has since been turned into the city prison, though it still goes by its original name, the Drain. [PARAGRAPH]A wall now surrounded the Drain and provided some protection from flood waters but Mikel felt nervous each time he entered the prison. [PARAGRAPH]"Afternoon captain. " a guard said as Mikel approached. Still fairly new to his role Mikel was surprised to see the respect accorded him by junior guards. And the few guarding the prison seemed even more impressed as they stood formally and one unlocked the outside gate to let him in. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel headed through the gate and down the gradually sloping stone staircase. Lamps were set in the walls, and though the staircase was clean and dry, moisture beaded on the walls. [PARAGRAPH]At the end the stairwell opened to the prisons main processing room. Almost a dozen guards worked here and four main shafts lead out to the converted cells. [PARAGRAPH]"Are you captain Alaunus?" a guard asked. He was sitting at a desk beside a woman draped in a cranberry shawl. [PARAGRAPH]At the mention of his name many of the guards, who had been talking to each other or filling out papers, stopped working and looked up. But the woman didn't turn. She sat facing the guard that had called for him, with her back to Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes I am. " Mikel said crossing the room to the guard's desk, "I was hoping to speak with Cain. I have a few questions about his purpose here in Bourne. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course captain. " the guard said. "He is in tunnel C. But we may have a witness that saw the woman who was traveling with Cain last night. " The guard indicated the woman sitting at his desk. [PARAGRAPH]The woman looked to be both frail and fierce. Her shawl was gathered tightly about her in the cool dungeon. The hands grasping at it were gaunt, little more than skin worn thin by years pulled over gnarled bone. But her clear grey eyes refused to admit weakness. She was angry, or annoyed, or her scowl was permanently fixed on her face. It was not a face accustomed to smiling. [PARAGRAPH]"Hello ma'am. " Mikel said. "I'm captain Mikel Alaunus of the north bridge. I fought with the woman and her guards last night. They killed two of my men. Can you describe the woman you saw?"[PARAGRAPH]The woman didn't answer, she just stared at Mikel in a way that made him feel guilty, though he wasn't sure what for. The guard broke the silence, reading from his notes. [PARAGRAPH]"Fisher Lizabeth Konal," the guard started, once again indicating the woman, "said her son was at the Sparrow last night being chatted up by young foreign lady who matched the description of the woman on the bridge. Pretty, with dark hair and cloak that was so dark red it was nearly black. She said any man in the bar would have been happy to pay for her, and didn't know why she would be wasting her time on her dullard of a son. "[PARAGRAPH]Seeing Mikel's look of surprise the guard quickly added, "That's from her description, not from me captain. "[PARAGRAPH]"Did you see her closely?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes, I went in to yell at my son. " Lizabeth answered, "To get him to the docks to work a shift but he was rooted to the bar stool as usual. That witch glared at me. I've seen more warmth in a corpse's eyes. " Her voice was a thin rasp entirely suited for her angry face. [PARAGRAPH]"Can we speak to your son?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"If you can find him. He's been missing since last night. " she answered. [PARAGRAPH]"We already have two men out looking for him and a patrol out searching the area around the Sparrow. " the guard added quickly. [PARAGRAPH]"Why would she want to talk to your son?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"No idea. The boy is as useless as a painting to a blind man. " she said. [PARAGRAPH]The old woman didn't seem willing to offer anything further. [PARAGRAPH]"Any thoughts soldier?" Mikel asked the guard. [PARAGRAPH]"No captain. By all accounts Anton Konal, that's her son, was a large man. Maybe a good six to nine inches taller than you. He was a guard for a brief time a few years ago but rarely reported to his shift and was let go. Now he spends his time drinking in the Sparrow, passed out on its floor or working as a dock hand. Fisher Konal's assessment of her son seems accurate. It's unlikely he is a secret Sheaim contact in the city, or of any real use to anyone. "[PARAGRAPH]Then, as if forgetting he was speaking in front of Anton's mother the guard added, "Sorry ma'am". [PARAGRAPH]"All true," she said. [PARAGRAPH]"It does sound like her. " Mikel said, "I will ask Cain about it. Soldier, if the patrol turns anything up would you let me know? I will be stationed at the north bridge tonight. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course captain. " the guard replied. [PARAGRAPH]After thanking Fisher Konal, Mikel headed down into Tunnel C. Mikel walked passed rows of cells, some empty and others filled with a mix of pickpockets, prostitutes and drunkards. After walking to the end of the first row and down a spiral staircase, Cain's cell became obvious. There was a small group of people standing outside it. [PARAGRAPH]Two guards stood silent watch outside the cell, another pair was inside. There was a man in an orange waistcoat who Mikel recognized as a local speaker, and a Literal with pale yellow robes was tending to a small brazier that was burning incense. Lastly captain Cerron, the head of the prison stood looking into the cell. Cerron noticed Mikel approaching. [PARAGRAPH]"Captain Alunus, welcome to the Drain. I'm sorry I haven't had a chance to make it out to the north bridge and congratulate you on your promotion yet. " Captain Cerron said. [PARAGRAPH]"Thank you captain," Mikel replied, "I know you are busy and it's only a matter of time before all the sentry captains get to meet with you. I am only sorry we couldn't be meeting over a less tragic incident. "[PARAGRAPH]"Yes, this one is a mystery. And I'm sorry to hear about your men. My son trained with soldier Ruen, he was a good man. " Cerron said. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes he was. " Mikel said. "How is the interrogation going?"[PARAGRAPH]"We haven't gotten much out of him. " Cerron answered. "He claims he and his companions were cutting through Bourne on their way to Galveholm and he doubts either of them are still in Bourne. He says the woman's name is Gosea and the other man's name was Mahon. The Literal is preparing for the kiss of the innocent so we know if he is lying or not. "[PARAGRAPH]"Do you mind if I ask him a few questions?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Captain Cerron checked with the speaker and the Literal, neither of which had any objection. [PARAGRAPH]"But I will need your weapons before you enter the cell. Just in case. " Cerron said. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel removed his sword belt and handed it to the captain. Then one of the guards unlocked the cell as the others stood ready for Cain to move. But Cain sat on a bench in the back of the cell with his head down and his curly hair hanging in front of his face. He didn't look up even as Mikel entered the cell, crossed it and sat down beside him. [PARAGRAPH]The two men were similar in size with deep coppery skin. They both had black hair and similar tattoos across their chest, back and arms. The connection was not lost on Mikel who was so accustomed to looking different that sitting by a man that could have been his brother was unsettling. [PARAGRAPH]"Have they told you about the kiss of the innocent?" Mikel began. With no sound from Cain he continued, "They heat a coal on the brazier, then pray over it. When their prayers are complete they will put it in your mouth. If you have been honest the coal will not burn you. If you have lied, then it will burn your mouth and tongue so badly you will never speak again. "[PARAGRAPH]"Do you believe that?" Cain asked, his head still down. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel was surprised by the question. He knew many questioned the impact of the gods in the world, but this was a man who traveled with a witch who could drink the sound out of an area and another who could stand on the end of a spear without adding any weight to it. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course I do. I have seen it performed many times. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"I've have some experience with torture. This technique is also used among the Sheaim but without the religious trappings. I think it originally came from the Bannor. It works because a lying man is more nervous, his mouth goes dry and the coal burns him. An innocent man has more moisture in his mouth so he isn't burned. That's assuming the coal is prepared at the right temperature. If it is too hot anyone will be burned by it. I suspect your preparation ritual is all about getting it to the correct temperature, at least I hope it is. " Cain said, finally looking up at where the Literal was still praying over the brazier. [PARAGRAPH]"Have you been honest?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Why wouldn't I be? The worst I've done you already know. I killed a couple of your men. I assume you are going to kill me for it. Why lie?"[PARAGRAPH]"Do you know where your companions are now?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Cain ignored the question. Looking at Mikel he asked, "Why did you become a rooster?"[PARAGRAPH]"I fled Galveholm because I was on the losing side of one of the street wars. I ended up here by accident, but I liked it. It was a better life and they are good people. Lugus revealed himself to me and allowed me to become something more than the thug and murderer I was. " Mikel answered. "In fact, that night on the bridge I saw an angel. It healed my lieutenant and told me there was a disease in Bourne I was to help cleanse. But it didn't tell me how. "[PARAGRAPH]"Why do you suppose the gods never tell us the whole story?" Cain asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I think it's because your friends are the disease and you know where they are. So I already have everything I need. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"You are wrong, I have no idea where they are. Probably halfway to Galveholm. I think the gods don't tell us the full story because if we knew how things were going to turn out, we would never follow them. " Cain said. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel considered Cain quietly. He didn't believe Cain was lying, but Mikel had been softened by years living in Bourne. People here were horrible liars, they became nervous and talkative. Among the Sheaim many had no guilt lying or killing, and they talked emotionlessly about both. [PARAGRAPH]"Your friend lived?" Cain asked. [PARAGRAPH]"My lieutenant, yes. The angel healed him. " Mikel answered. [PARAGRAPH]"Mahon isn't going to be happy about that. He likes to claim anytime he swings his axes, someone dies. As far as I know it has always been true. "[PARAGRAPH]"Do you think he will stay in Bourne long enough to kill Ceth?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"No, he will do what Gosea wants. And she is too practical to care about Mahon's streak or a guard that got away. " Cain said. [PARAGRAPH]"Any idea why Gosea was at a bar last night chatting up a local dock hand?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]For the first time Cain looked surprised. When Mikel asked again Cain denied knowing why she would be there, and this time Mikel was sure he was lying. Despite Mikel's attempts to get any more information Cain wouldn't talk. Hearing about the bar visit had scared him, or reinforced his loyalty. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel stayed long enough to watch the Literal place the coal in Cain's mouth. Though Cain attempted to take it willingly, to get the test over with quickly, his fear overcame him at the last second and he had to be restrained by the guards and the coal forced into his mouth. [PARAGRAPH]Cain was uninjured by the coal beyond some minor burns. It was enough for the Literal to proclaim he had been honest in all his answers. Mikel doubted that was the case. [PARAGRAPH]But it was getting close to time for the night shift. Though he felt like he hadn't gained any usable information Mikel thanked captain Cerron and headed out of the Drain on the long walk to the north bridge. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 6[PARAGRAPH]Anton Konal had been burning for nearly twenty hours. [PARAGRAPH]It hadn't been hard to lure him to the empty silo, he followed Gosea without complaint. Even though he towered over the petite witch, he hadn't tried to force himself on her. Instead he begged and offered clumsy compliments in an attempt to seduce her. Gosea was disgusted by him. [PARAGRAPH]The hard part was finding a place for the sacrifice. Since it was early spring many of the silos along the docks were empty, and Mahon found one large enough to construct what they needed without anyone seeing the fire. Gosea's magic would take care of the screams. [PARAGRAPH]Once Anton arrived Mahon tied him to the large post in the center of the empty silo. Anton was forced atop a pile of refuse from the docks, splintered crates and barrels, planks and rope. All were coated with lamp oil. [PARAGRAPH]Gosea lit the flames and they stood in perfect silence as Anton writhed in pain. The fire consumed his feet then up along his legs. His skin peeled and blackened, revealing thick layers of fat beneath that burned and melted like candle wax. There was so much fat on him that hot, liquid streams of it crawled down his legs and dripped hissing into the fire. [PARAGRAPH]In time he stopped screaming, but Gosea's magic wouldn't let him die. His voice was gone and the flames had eaten away all the unnecessary parts of him. Anton's massive frame, blackened and burnt, was little more than bones covered with thick muscle. [PARAGRAPH]That was when the ritual changed. Instead of being consumed by the fire Anton's body began consuming it. Mahon poured more lamp oil on the fire until the flames were as high as Anton's waist but Anton seemed empowered by it. The fire greedily licked at Anton's chest, arms and shoulders. It was absorbed and drawn into him. And over time a hot orange glow came from within his chest, and behind his eyes. [PARAGRAPH]There he stood, eyes fixed on Gosea in passive supplication. He was no longer alive, but unable to die. His most basic animalistic desires were tethered to his body by Gosea's spell. When the ritual was done Mahon cut him free and what had been Anton lumbered off the pyre, ready to receive Gosea's commands. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 7[PARAGRAPH]The midnight bells rang through the city. Dawn and noon were sacred times in Bourne, even dusk was seen as a time of reflection and rest. But there was little comfort in midnight. In the well ordered city this was the one time when strange things happened. And it was when the two guards standing attention at the Drain's outer gate spotted Anton Konal's corpse lumbering toward them. [PARAGRAPH]A cloak had been placed over him, but it was nearly burnt off. His body glowed like a coal, his skin and muscles were charred and black, but beneath the guards could see slivers of orange fire. Though the body lumbering toward them was on fire it was more terrifying that the flames didn't seem to bother it. [PARAGRAPH]The guards yelled for help before grabbing their spears. Neither had any desire to get close to the creature. [PARAGRAPH]They waited until they heard other guards running up the stairs out of the Drain before attacking. One stabbed Anton's corpse, and the creature made no attempt to avoid the spear. It punctured Anton's large chest and slid easily through. Anton hurried forward, up along the spear and grabbed the startled guard. His thick hands closed on the guards throats and the guards strangled screams were mixed with the pain of burning hands on his skin. [PARAGRAPH]"Shields men!" captain Cerron called, racing up the stairs behind his soldiers. "Do not waste yourself on lethal attacks, the creature has no vulnerable organs. Lop off any piece that gets close to you. "[PARAGRAPH]Following their orders the guards with shields readied them and closed with short blades and axes. Anton turned and the spear that was still stuck through him spun wildly, but when Anton reached for another soldier he was blocked by a shield. One guard sliced across Anton's back with a sword, and another, with a lucky blow from his axe, severed Anton's hand. [PARAGRAPH]Anton roared in anger. The places where he had been struck burned with an angry orange light. [PARAGRAPH]"Be patient men, we will bring this creature down. " Cerron called, readying his own shield as Anton's attention turned to him. [PARAGRAPH]Anton charged, and though two guards stabbed him with spears he ignored both attacks. One guard was whipped around by the force of the charging giant, the other spear snapped in half. [PARAGRAPH]Cerron dove toward the creature's left side. Though Anton had no hand on that arm he beat it furiously against the captain's shield like a giant club. Cerron deflected the attack and returned his own, ducking low and chopping into Anton's knee with his axe. [PARAGRAPH]Despite the lack of pain, or the need for lungs, heart or mind even the walking dead still need their knees. As the kneecap splintered Anton fell onto the street. [PARAGRAPH]The guards were quick to take advantage of the fall. Cerron spun to deliver another blow to the back of Anton's leg, nearly amputating it entirely. A flurry of other attacks rained down on the creature's body, each leaving an angry hot scar in its place. [PARAGRAPH]Anton shuddered and then his body exploded. With a final howl the flames were released from the prison of his burnt corpse and they swept out over the guards, the Drain front gate, and the surrounding buildings. The cobblestones burnt and fractured in the heat, the bodies of the soldiers did much worse. Helmets were melted to flesh, exposed skin was burnt down to bone. Cerron and his men were killed. [PARAGRAPH]There were only two guards left in the Drain, and they fell easily to Mahon's twin axes. [PARAGRAPH]"Split up and find Cain. " Gosea ordered, throwing Mahon the set of keys from one of the guards. "Let out anyone you find along the way. "[PARAGRAPH]Cain heard the explosion and knew what it was. By the time Gosea found his cell he was standing at the bars calling for her. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you tell them about the heartstone?" Gosea whispered as she unlocked his cell. [PARAGRAPH]"No, and they didn't ask about it. " Cain replied. "They just wanted to know where you were. I honestly told them I believed you would be halfway to Galveholm. "[PARAGRAPH]Gosea studied his face with eyes that revealed none of her thoughts. Then she handed Cain an axe she had taken from one of the guard's corpses. [PARAGRAPH]"Let us go. We don't have much time. " Gosea said. [PARAGRAPH]On the way up to the main processing room Cain saw that most of the cells were open and the prisoners had fled out into the city. Outside of one cell where the body of a prisoner lay dead on the floor. Cain guessed the excitement at his freedom had caused the man to try to take liberties with his beautiful rescuer. He hadn't even touched Gosea before she had killed him for it. [PARAGRAPH]They called for Mahon from the processing room and he ran up to meet them. Any prisoners that weren't released yet were left in their cells. Together the three fled up into the city. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 8[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stood floating above the high white walls of Bourne as dawn struck the great city. Once an angel had stood at each tower, divine guardians of this sacred city. The moniker Bourne the Gleaming was not due to the white walls, but the holy power that once permeated it. [PARAGRAPH]But that was centuries ago. In time, and across generations, the city had faded. The compact only allowed the gods, and their agents, to act when empowered by mortal faith. And there was little of that left in Bourne. [PARAGRAPH]As an angel of the god of revelation Verchiel stood silent witness to the triumphs and failures of the city, though there was little he could do to help, guide or protect its people. But each morning he prayed that it would get better, that through their faith he would be able to stand with them, that he could do more than watch them in pain. [PARAGRAPH]As Verchiel looked over the grey city the sun began to creep over its walls and light up the few citizens that had got an early start on the day. A baker plodded along the alleyway, yawning as he went. A young man rushed home, still swaying clumsily from the night before. [PARAGRAPH]From the heart of the city the cathedral bells rang and people headed to service. Born by the light streaming across the city Verchiel arched across the sky and as it struck the golden symbol of the Empyrean on the great Cathedral window Verchiel was there beside it. [PARAGRAPH]Inside parishioners talked in the muted tones of morning. Luminary Rimmon prepared himself for the morning service, thinking through the news of the attack and the way to calm the city before everyone learned about the prison breakin and the deaths of the guards. The Luminary was a decent man, more pragmatic than philosophical, more politician than priest. And though Verchiel had tried to go to him many times, the Luminary was unable to see or hear the angel. [PARAGRAPH]As the service started there was a flash of light from within the city, east of the cathedral. Not the light of fire or anything physical, but the outpouring of faith, of the true power of Lugus, the god of the Sun. [PARAGRAPH]It is hard to surprise an angel that has been with the world since the sun first shone upon it. But Verchiel was, for a long moment, stunned. Then, cautiously, he swept down from his perch on the cathedral and flew over the streets of Bourne. The people seemed unaware of the welling power, they opened their stands, brushed off their walks, or hurried to work as Verchiel swept over them. Until he found himself over a small plaza near the docs. Warehouses were on all sides, and this was typically used as a place for traders to meet and work out deals with the various ships docked nearby. But there were no new ships in yet today and the plaza was deserted. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel could feel the power here, it strengthened him and he noticed that, much like the city, he had faded as well. But the source of the power wasn't here in the plaza, it was under it. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel slipped down through the cobblestones and dirt and into the city sewers. He had rarely seen them before, it was rare that men of faith would have a reason to be in such dark corners. [PARAGRAPH]A symbol of the Empyrean was traced in gold on the smooth stone of the sewer platform. Light poured through it like a beacon and lit the chamber, sending light into places untouched by it for centuries. In the distance rats squeaked in frustration as they fled the area, and quieter predators slipped into the murky channels nearby and disappeared. [PARAGRAPH]On the other side of the sewer platform there was another rune, this one made of silver and inside it sat a woman with dark, empty eyes and skin that has never felt the touch of sunlight. [PARAGRAPH]She began talking while Verchiel looked around. She was looking right at him, though Verchiel couldn't hear her words. Behind her two men slept, seemingly unaware of what was happening, and she hadn't thought to protect them with the circle she used around herself. [PARAGRAPH]"Deceit and manipulation are as unknown to me as compassion to the fallen. " Verchiel said, "I cannot hear anything you say if it is not true. "[PARAGRAPH]As the woman considered, Verchiel looked within her. He was accustomed to some reaction from mortals that saw him, seeing the divine can make the corrupt repent, the simple pious, can make the devout transform. Even the most worldly had been awestruck by his presence. But this woman showed nothing. [PARAGRAPH]He saw within her a girl who didn't speak her first word until she was 8. She was raised in an asylum in Galveholm, and thought to be cursed or touched or simple. She spent years staring into the shadowed corners of her room and whispering to imagined things. Her eyes were the empty hopelessness of those who threw themselves off the high walls of Bourn, who cut themselves and watched with cold detachment as their life flowed out of them. The most remarkable thing about this woman was that she was here at all, Verchiel could see nothing within her that would motivate her to leave that small closet room at the asylum. A part of her may still remain there. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel was interrupted from his study as she spoke. [PARAGRAPH]"I want you to guide the people of this city to let us leave. If we have to fight our way out more people will die. " She said. [PARAGRAPH]"How did you consecrate this place?" Verchiel asked, ignoring her statement. [PARAGRAPH]"I didn't. " she said, "I opened a way to the Dies Diei, it is its light that you see, and feel, reflected here. "[PARAGRAPH]"And who are you?" Verchiel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I am Gosea the Dwindling, sorceress of Ceridwen. " She said. She said something after but it faded to nothing to Verchiel's ears, another lie. [PARAGRAPH]"Will you guide the city to let us leave?" Gosea asked. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel had heard of sorcerers trapping angels, but only in areas consecrated to the fallen. Bourne was no longer sacred, but he wondered if she thought it so weak that she could attack him, even beneath the city. [PARAGRAPH]"You are a husk, no different than the abomination you created from that poor dock worker. You are blind, afraid and alone. And you are dangerous. " Verchiel said. [PARAGRAPH]If his words had any effect on her, she didn't show it. "No," he continued, "I will guide them to stand against you and your queen. Faith opens our eyes, faith gives us courage and faith means that we are not alone. "[PARAGRAPH]With a thought Gosea extinguished the channel to Dies Diei. The light flickered out and the shadows rushed in to reclaim it. There was no attack from Gosea, she simply pulled her hood over her head and rested her chin on her palms while Verchiel slipped up through the top of the chamber and back into the daylight in the small plaza. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 9[PARAGRAPH]Gosea was still sitting in the runic circle when Mahon woke up. He stretched lazily and then stood up without bending his waist or using any momentum. He simply placed the soles of his feet on the floor and straightened his knees in denial of the fact that it should have been impossible to do so. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you commune with the dead?" Mahon asked, studying the circle. He had learned a little about sorcery while traveling with Gosea, but he didn't recognize any of the symbols she had carefully traced out. [PARAGRAPH]"No," she answered, "I spoke with an angel of Lugus, the one that sanctified this city. I was hoping we could skip this battle and get on to our task. "[PARAGRAPH]"I don't know much about angels. " Mahon said, "But I assume he didn't accept the offer. "[PARAGRAPH]"No. "[PARAGRAPH]"Should we be moving if he knows we are here? Can't he give someone a vision or commune with one of their sorcerers?" Mahon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I doubt there are any sorcerers talented enough to be able to see into the ether in Bourne. And holy men may be even rarer. The angel may be able to inspire those in his city, but they lack the faith to see or hear him, much as he might try. There are no miracles to be had in Bourne. "[PARAGRAPH]"I saw a miracle. " Cain said without moving. He was still on his bedroll, lying on his side and facing away from Gosea and Mahon. "The tower guard healed his companion, the one Mahon nearly decapitated. He prayed, and then it sounded like he was talking to someone. And his friend was healed. "[PARAGRAPH]"What was his name?" Gosea asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Mikel. " Cain said, "Captain Mikel Alaunus. "[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 10[PARAGRAPH]Just before dawn the next morning Mikel stood before the Cathedral of Bells. Ceth and Deirdre were with him. Deirdre was carrying Anna, who was slumped asleep on her mother's shoulder. [PARAGRAPH]All three were surprised to see that the cathedral was flooded with worshipers. And though it was the largest temple in the city, there were far too many people clamoring in front of the temple to get inside. [PARAGRAPH]"What's going on?" Deirdre asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know. " Mikel said, "Ceth, can you see if you can find Knight Commander Marlowe? I don't know if we are going to be able to find open seats for the service. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel and Deirdre waited outside and watched the crowd as Ceth tried to find Marlowe. At first Mikel wondered if the crowd may have gathered because of his vision. But these people seemed nervous and afraid. Judging by their clothing, many were from the docks. [PARAGRAPH]A few Literals came out of the temple and began to organize the crowd into smaller groups for prayers and sermons in the open square. Mikel was considering joining one when Ceth poked out of the cathedral and waved for Mikel and Deirdre to join him. [PARAGRAPH]"Marlowe has seats reserved for us. " Ceth said when they reached him. [PARAGRAPH]They followed Ceth into the cathedral. Compared to the small Fenestran temple the cathedral was a palace. A high arched foyer was decorated with candles and organ music from the nave could be heard echoing throughout. [PARAGRAPH]The nave was huge and shaped like an amphitheater, with two rows of balconies overlooking the main floor and a central stage where seven thrones faced a long, marble altar. Unlit candles wreathed the stage. Behind the stage a staircase seemed to ascend into a gold, topaz and amber sun design, but actually led to the cathedrals presbytery . [PARAGRAPH]"Luminary Rimmon would like to speak with you before the service. " Ceth said. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel followed Ceth up the cathedral's central aisle and onto the stage. Mikel felt the eyes of the crowded cathedral on their backs as they walked across the stage. It wasn't unusual to have guards in attendance, even in full uniform, but it was unusual to have them going to speak to the Luminary before the service. [PARAGRAPH]Knight Commander Marlowe was in the shallow preparation area behind the stage talking with Luminary Rimmon and a few Literals. Ceth and Mikel stood a respectful distance away until Marlowe waved them over. [PARAGRAPH]"Speaker Rimmon, allow me to introduce the soldiers I told you about. This is captain Mikel Alaunus and his lieutenant Ceth Kiln. " Marlowe said. [PARAGRAPH]"It is a pleasure to meet you captain. " Rimmon said, grasping Mikel's hand. Rimmon was a powerfully built man for a priest; he would be as comfortable on the battlefield as he was within the cathedral. His pale yellow robes and glittering necklace of sunstones contrasted with his short, practical hair and callous hands. [PARAGRAPH]"It is an honor. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"And you as well lieutenant Kiln. " Rimmon said, turning to Ceth. "Are those scars from the attack," He examined Ceth's neck, "and that were healed by the power of Lugus?"[PARAGRAPH]"Yes eyeman. I mean, yes Luminary. " Ceth said turning a bit red in the face. [PARAGRAPH]Rimmon smiled. "Eyeman is fine. You can even call me Rimmon if you want, though I have yet to meet a soldier that will do that. "[PARAGRAPH]After he was finished examining Ceth's scars Rimmon added, "And you captain Alaunus, you saw the angel?"[PARAGRAPH]"Yes Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"What did the angel look like?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"He appeared to be the angel from one of the stained glass windows in the Fenestran temple. Literal Edain identified him as Verchiel. He had skin like yellow glass with light shining through it. He appeared as a stained glass window come to life. " Mikel said. Mikel was sure that Rimmon had already heard the details of his vision, though it seemed he preferred to get an account directly from Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]"And what did he tell you?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"That there is a sickness within Bourne. That I can stop it if I have faith. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]Rimmon considered Mikel closely, much as he had investigated Ceth's scars. "Have you heard about the attack last night?"[PARAGRAPH]Mikel and Ceth exchanged concerned looks. [PARAGRAPH]"No Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"I'll let Marlowe fill you in on the details. " Rimmon said, "But the city is in a panic and I intend to use your vision to help bring calm. The people need to know that Lugus cares for us, that he is protecting us. Do you agree with that?"[PARAGRAPH]"Yes of course Luminary. " Mikel said, though he wasn't sure how he felt about his vision being used for propaganda. Or how protected the city really was if there had been an attack last night. [PARAGRAPH]After a pause Rimmon added, "Is there anything you left out of your story? Anything you would like to clarify? This is the time for brutal truth captain. "[PARAGRAPH]"No Luminary. " Mikel said, "I take the mandate of truth very seriously. It is exactly as I said. "[PARAGRAPH]"Very good captain. I don't mean to question your integrity, but before a sermon I have to make sure everything I say is true. I hope you understand. " Rimmon said. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]At that they were ushered to their seats. Marlowe had some set aside in the first balcony. There was even a seat reserved for Anna, though she preferred to sit on her mother's lap. [PARAGRAPH]"What was Luminary Rimmon like?" Deirdre whispered as they waited for the service to start. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know. " Mikel said, "He seemed worried about the city. "[PARAGRAPH]The touch of dawn light on the windows signaled the beginning of the service. Literal's funneled in from the foyer, each carrying a tall candle. As one they lit the candles around the stage, bringing the cathedral to light. [PARAGRAPH]Luminary Rimmon came up from the back of the stage with a large tome in his hands. He set the tome on a stand and then thanked the Literals, who bowed slightly and retreated to the edges of the room. [PARAGRAPH]"Another day has come, another promise has been kept. " Rimmon said. Then he paused, looking out at the assembled faces and down at his notes. Seeming to abandon his notes Rimmon spoke directly to the room. "We were attacked last night and eleven guardsmen were killed. In the docks some buildings caught fire and nearly three dozen prisoners escaped from the Drain. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel and Ceth looked first at each other and then at Marlowe, who returned their looks with a slight nod. They seemed to be the only ones in the room who didn't know about the attack. [PARAGRAPH]"Captain Cerron was one of the men killed. " Marlowe whispered. [PARAGRAPH]"Did Cain escape?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Marlowe nodded again. [PARAGRAPH]"It was a horrible night. " Rimmon continued. "But it is day now, and Lugus has not forgotten the people of Bourne. Many of you have heard rumors of a miracle on the north bridge, and I can tell you that it is true. An angel saved the life of a guard near death and delivered a message to one of our captains warning us of the coming danger. "[PARAGRAPH]There were audible gasps from the audience. [PARAGRAPH]"That captain is with us, Captain Mikel Alaunus. As well as the man the angel saved, Lieutenant Ceth Kiln. " Rimmon gestured toward where Mikel and Ceth sat on the balcony and everyone in the temple craned to see them. "Lieutenant Kiln still carries the scars from the attack but he has recovered. The city of Bourne is unchanged. "[PARAGRAPH]Rimmon continued with his sermon, comforting and encouraging the audience to stand firm, to carry a message of hope out to the city. But Mikel lost track of his words. The angel Verchiel was walking down the center aisle of the nave, and no one seemed to notice. [PARAGRAPH]The angel's wings were spread, and exactly as he had appeared before his skin seemed to glow like the sun through honey. In his left hand he held his familiar crescent shaped shield, but in his right he held a sword that burned with a perfect golden fire. [PARAGRAPH]The light from Verchiel was nearly blinding. It reflected from every surface in the cathedral and yet no one turned to look at him. When he walked between the people and where they sat looking at Rimmon they continued to look straight ahead. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stopped at the front of the aisle, directly in front of Rimmon. If anything Rimmon may have squinted his eyes in the light, but he continued his sermon and ignored the angel. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel looked at Dierdre and Ceth, but neither seemed to notice the angel. They both sat contentedly listening to Rimmon's sermon as the angel turned and walked to the edge of the room, where a single Literal stood watching the sermon. The Literal was an old woman, as old as Mikel had ever seen working at the church. She was thin, with grey hair and age spots on her wrinkled skin. Her face was etched with wisdom and sadness. And Mikel was sure she could see the angel. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stopped in front of the woman and spoke to her. Mikel couldn't hear the angel's words, but they sounded compassionate and kind. The woman's eyes filled with tears, then she looked away and hurried out of the cathedral. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel's light dimmed with her loss. Then with a great flap of his wings Verchiel took off into the open air of the cathedral and soared toward where Mikel was sitting in the balcony. He landed easily on the balcony rail, just in front of Dierdre, though she continued to stare through him at Rimmon just as the rest of the room was. [PARAGRAPH]"We are at the center of the sickness. I will show you that which blinds others. " Verchiel said. [PARAGRAPH]And with that the world changed to one painted in grays. Around him the ghost-like figures of the cathedral dreamed, whispered, cried or simply sat apart from the world around them. Though an angel, who retained his radiant orange and yellow colors, stood a few feet from them they didn't see him. [PARAGRAPH]"Why can't they see you?" Mikel whispered. [PARAGRAPH]"Fear, ambition, apathy. " Verchiel said, "In some cases even hope or love can bind them. Anything that can keep a man from fully trusting the divine. I have stood eternal guard over them and the city, and in too many cases I have been forced too only watch as they have suffered. I can touch upon the power of Lugus, but only as the faith of man allows. "[PARAGRAPH]"How can that faith be restored?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"We must pierce the darkness. " Verchiel and Luminary Rimmon both said at once. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel was momentarily confused by hearing the two voices together, but Rimmon continued with his sermon, unaware he had answered Mikel's question or had spoken in concert with an angel. [PARAGRAPH]"What can I do?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Tell your command to maintain the guards at the gates. Although they are dangerous, one of their number is injured. One of them could escape at any time by walking across the river. But the sorceress is weakened in this city, her strength will not return on this ground and she will not escape unless we allow it. "[PARAGRAPH]With that Verchiel was gone and the cathedral dropped back to the normal colors of the world, though to Mikel's eyes they seemed more drab after watching the angel. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel listened and prayed as Rimmon finished the sermon, offerings were accepted and the crowd seemed more generous on the eve of the tragedy, or more hopeful to buy some of Lugus's goodwill. [PARAGRAPH]After the closing prayer everyone rose and began funneling out of the cathedral. Mikel touched Deirdre's arm as she was about to leave. [PARAGRAPH]"Go home. " Mikel said. "I have to speak to Marlowe, I will be home soon. "[PARAGRAPH]"Come home with us. " Deirdre said, pulling at his shirt. "You have already done so much. "[PARAGRAPH]"I'll be home later. " Mikel said, then softening he kissed his wife and his daughter. "I will be okay. "[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre looked ready to argue but she let it go. She whispered something to him, but it was lost in the surrounding voices and then she was gone in the crowd heading out of the building. [PARAGRAPH]"Knight Commander," Mikel said, "may I speak with you and the Luminary Rimmon again?"[PARAGRAPH]Marlowe looked surprised, but he nodded and Marlowe, Mikel and Ceth worked their way against the crowd and down to the altar where Rimmon stood comforting a few of the parishioners that had approached him after the service. [PARAGRAPH]Intimidated by the arrival of the soldiers the parishioners said a quick goodbye and left Rimmon alone with them. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes Captain?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel became suddenly self-conscious, he looked around to see if he could see the angel, but Verchiel was gone. [PARAGRAPH]"The angel spoke to me again, during your service. " Mikel said. Ceth's eyes widened and Marlowe looked nervous. If Rimmon showed any emotion it was only a slight pursing of his lips. [PARAGRAPH]"And what did he say?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel relayed the story as he remembered it, from the vision of the gray cathedral full of parishioners wrapped in their own worries, to the warnings about watching the gates and continuing to look for Gosea and her companions. [PARAGRAPH]Rimmon listened to the whole story and considered his words carefully before asking, "Why do you think an angel would tell you to have us do something we are already doing?"[PARAGRAPH]"I don't know Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"Why do you think the angel delivers these messages to you instead of," Rimmon paused here, picking his words carefully, "more senior members of the temple?"[PARAGRAPH]"I don't know Luminary. " Mikel answered again. [PARAGRAPH]"Your vision and the people in this cathedral that couldn't hear the angel because of their more earthly concerns, did that apply to me as well?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel began to answer that he didn't know again. But he did know, and he again thought of his vows and the Mandate of Truth. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes Luminary, I believe it did. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel kept his eyes down on the floor, he didn't want to know what expression was on Rimmon's face. [PARAGRAPH]"Is there anything else captain?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"No Luminary. "[PARAGRAPH]With that Rimmon turned and walked back across the stage and into the presbytery. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 11[PARAGRAPH]It was a long walk back to Wyn Manor. Mikel had said goodbye to Ceth and Marlowe at the Cathedral of Bells and he kept his head down as he walked across the city. A few people called out to him as he passed, even some he didn't know and he half-heartedly returned their calls. [PARAGRAPH]He entered the Wyn manor kitchen as he had before, the kitchen smelled good and there was a fresh plate of bread and cheese sitting on the table. [PARAGRAPH]"Diery?" AnnaSophia called from upstairs. [PARAGRAPH]"No," Mikel called back, suddenly shaken out of his dark thoughts, "It's Mikel. Did Deirdre leave?"[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia came into the kitchen and her expression answered Mikel's question. Before she said anything he was back out the door and running toward the small house he shared with his wife and daughter. [PARAGRAPH]She wasn't supposed to go home alone, but maybe she forgot something. Maybe Anna wanted one of her toys. There is no chance that, out of all of the people of Bourne, Deirdre and Anna would run into Gosea. But somehow Mikel knew that was exactly what happened. Cain knew who he was. Everyone in the city was talking about them, it wouldn't have been hard to find out he had a wife and daughter. [PARAGRAPH]By the time he reached his house his world began falling apart one piece at a time. First the note pinned to the front door with a hairpin like Deirdre wore. He opened it with shaking hands. [PARAGRAPH][PARAGRAPH]Mikel,[PARAGRAPH]Order your men, claim a vision, do whatever you need to do to draw the guards away from the harbor gate tonight. If you do so, we will leave the city without incident. If you don't we will sacrifice your wife and your sweet daughter to Ceridwen, the breaker of men, and then kill many more on our way out of your dusty city. [PARAGRAPH]The choice is yours. Cain hopes you deny us, your wife reminds him of his own. [PARAGRAPH] - Gosea[PARAGRAPH][PARAGRAPH]Mikel was back at Wyn manor. He hadn't noticed the walk back, the city was a distant echo, a world apart from the prison of fear collapsing on him. AnnaSophia met him in the yard, and though she asked questions he couldn't understand them. He only held out the note as explanation. She read it and rushed him into the house. [PARAGRAPH]"Mikel, Deirdre needs you. Anna needs you. " AnnaSophia said, that at least echoed through to him. [PARAGRAPH]"I'm here. " Mikel replied, "I understand. " He tried to force the fear away. I need to get to the guard station, I need. . . to pray. "[PARAGRAPH]"No," AnnaSophia said, her voice perfectly calm, her eyes as focused and adamant as any knight commander. "You must do what they want. "[PARAGRAPH]"I cannot forsake Lugus. " Mikel said, "He will protect Deirdre and Anna, he will protect us if we remain faithful. As he did with Ceth. "[PARAGRAPH]"I have lost one faithful family member in Lugus's service already, I will not offer up my daughter and granddaughter!" AnnaSophia nearly screamed, her resolve falling apart like shattered glass. "Do you imagine that the faithful never fail, that they never suffer, that they never die? That I didn't once tell myself that Lugus would protect what I loved and bring him home safe? You can bring her home safe, you are the only one. "[PARAGRAPH]"Let me pray. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 12[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel knew Deirdre and Anna were being held in an abandoned workshop near the docks. He knew that Cain was watching them and that if the guards rushed the building they could save them before Cain could kill them. But there was a reason Gosea had taken Mikel's wife, she didn't know if she could control him, but she knew she could destroy him. And now Verchiel watched the small flicker of Mikel's faith, that gateway that allowed him to speak to Mikel, go out. [PARAGRAPH]Though Mikel prayed, though tears ran down his face and he desperately wanted to hear, and though Verchiel stood beside him in spirit, with tears streaming down his own face, that vast chasm of fear and doubt kept them apart. [PARAGRAPH]"Your desire to be faithful isn't enough. " Verchiel whispered. "You must give up your fear, you must place your faith in Lugus and I will make you a beacon that will drive away the night. "[PARAGRAPH]But Mikel couldn't hear him. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 13[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia hands only trembled a bit as she sipped her tea. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you get an answer?" she asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel stood up, still stunned as he had been ever since he saw the note, but he no longer had the delusion of a quick solution. [PARAGRAPH]"No, I saw the angel before, he talked to me, I don't know why he won't come now. "[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia didn't offer an answer. [PARAGRAPH]"I love my city, I love my religion and I love Lugus. " She said carefully. "But there is a limit to all things. Maybe I'm weak, but we can't sacrifice the people we love for our beliefs. It doesn't serve Lugus to let them die. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel picked up the note and headed out the manor's front door. [PARAGRAPH]"Are you going to save them?" AnnaSophia asked. [PARAGRAPH]He stopped in the doorway with his back to her. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know. " Mikel said, it was all he could offer before he headed out into the street. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 14[PARAGRAPH]Mikel met Commander Marlowe and Luminary Rimmon at the Cathedral of Bells. The vaulted ceilings of the cathedral had never seemed more empty, and though they stood close together and talked in hushed tones in the empty cathedral, their voices echoed back them in conspiratorial whispers. [PARAGRAPH]"I know what they are going to try to do. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]Marlowe hadn't questioned Mikel's request to meet at the temple with Rimmon. Both men could see the concern and panic on Mikel's face and in his voice. Though they waited, Mikel didn't say anything. [PARAGRAPH]"Is Deirdre okay?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel's head fell into his hands. "No Luminary, she's not. They took her and Anna. I don't know where they are. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel explained the note and the threat as they listened. [PARAGRAPH]"Maybe we are best to let them flee the city, and we will have the best chance to save Mikel's wife and daughter. Commander do you really think you could stop them if they wanted to fight their way out? The witch's power is considerable. " Rimmon said. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know Luminary. " Marlowe answered. "But they have killed my men, our brothers, I still have families to meet with. Though more may die, I cannot simply let them go unavenged. "[PARAGRAPH]"What are your thought's Captain? Am I to assume that you wish to fight the battle since you declined their offer to mislead us?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I am bound by the Mandate of Truth. " Mikel said, "And I remain devote to the sun, even during deepest night. What if we pretend to abandon the gate?"[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 15[PARAGRAPH]Mahon slipped in the small home through a panel in the roof, falling to the floor with the grace of a dancer stepping from one step to another. [PARAGRAPH]"Did they clear the gate?" Gosea asked. [PARAGRAPH]"They are pretending to. Soldiers are disguised as commoners, some are hidden in the gatehouse. The chains inside the gate hang unlocked, but they have attached another set on the other side of the gate. "[PARAGRAPH]"What needless sacrifice. " Gosea said, mostly to herself. "Cain, kill the mother and child. "[PARAGRAPH]"Does it matter?" Cain asked, and though Gosea's dark eyes didn't reflect any irritation at his question, she did study him closely. [PARAGRAPH]"I assumed we would kill them either way. " Mahon said as he settled on the couch. [PARAGRAPH]"It's a spiritual game we play. " Gosea answered. "If the captain would have betrayed his city and god, then I have no need for his family, he is broken. But if he has chosen to trust his faith, then I cannot allow that fire to burn at our back. I cannot have his faith rewarded or we risk a new enemy for Galveholm. "[PARAGRAPH]"If we kill his family, he will be an enemy of Galveholm. " Cain said. [PARAGRAPH]"A man of faith can do more than an army of soldiers. He is useless broken. Kill his family. "[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 16[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel dropped to his knees and cried. He was an angel of Lugus, lord of the dawn and revelation, but he was unable to deliver his message. He knew where Mikel's wife and daughter were imprisoned, Verchiel was kneeling beside them in the ether. But Mikel was too full of fear and doubt to hear the angel's voice. Even now the witch and her guards were in the small homes common room planning to kill their prisoners. Deirdre and Anna had only a few minutes left to live. [PARAGRAPH]"Why are you crying?"[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stopped in surprise. He looked up to see see the innocent face of Anna looking at him quizzically. [PARAGRAPH]"Can you see me child?" Verchiel asked, equally puzzled. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course. " she said, "What is your name?"[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre sat staring at the iron bound door of the cell as she had since she was taken. The room was an old cellar and still had a pile of old tools and supplies in it. She had been through it a dozen times but there was nothing that could help her escape. She tried to stay strong and save her tears for when her daughter wasn't watching. She was so lost in her thoughts it took her a minute to realize Anna was holding a conversation with an old broom. [PARAGRAPH]"Chipmunk, who are you talking to?" Deirdre asked. [PARAGRAPH]Anna smiled, "His name is Verchiel, he's an angel and he will help us get back to daddy. "[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre had no words. At three years old her daughter had gone crazy. Deirdre wasn't sure if she should be jealous of her daughters hope, or condemn her for it. [PARAGRAPH]"We need something shiny" Anna said, going through the pile of supplies. She finally found an old copper plate that seemed to satisfy her and she started cleaning it with the hem of her dress. [PARAGRAPH]Deirdre heard the door to the cellar open. It was barely an hour since they had been fed and an unexpected visit from their kidnappers couldn't be good. Deirdre pulled Anna into her arms and when she squirmed Deirdre told her to be quiet. [PARAGRAPH]There was a jingle of keys and the cellar door opened. Cain, the largest of the kidnappers, opened the door. He had his axe drawn. [PARAGRAPH]"Sorry" he said with some sympathy, "your husband's too stubborn for his own good. "[PARAGRAPH]At that Anna tore free of her mother's grip and stood protectively in front of her. She held the polished copper plate above her head and Cain stepped back slightly at the sudden move. Nothing happened. [PARAGRAPH]Then Anna asked the broom, "What do I say?"[PARAGRAPH]"Come on. " Cain said. "There's no joy in killing a child. But you won't be my first. "[PARAGRAPH]"You cannot hide your actions" Anna shouted in a voice half her own and half unworldly, "Lugus will reveal all. If you mean to escape, then flee now into the darkness; this area has been claimed by the rose of summer!"[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre was stunned. But Cain wasn't about to be cowed by a three year with an old plate, and he stepped towards Anna. [PARAGRAPH]The copper plate exploded in light. It was as if Anna held the sun above her head. Cain covered his eyes in pain as light flooded the cellar, the small stairway and up in-to the home. Inside the house it rushed over Mahon and Gosea and broke free of every window or crack in the home's walls and spilled out onto the dark streets of Bourne and through the patchwork roof up into the night sky. [PARAGRAPH]Everyone in Bourne who had ever whispered a silent prayer to Lugus felt the stirring of holy power. The guards hidden at the harbor gate threw off their disguises and rushed to the home, as did the nearby watch and the local eyemen. [PARAGRAPH]Cain tried to stand against the waves of blinding light even though it burnt through to his closed and shielded eyes. He placed his axe in front of him and risked one peek at where he thought Anna was standing. When he looked he saw a golden angel standing before him with a blazing sword. [PARAGRAPH]"My arda is upon these two, you will not harm them. " the angel said. [PARAGRAPH]Cain raised his axe and pressed forward, but he was engulfed in light. Every darkness within him was undone, every cruel, pained memory swallowed like shadows chased out of a brightly lit room. Cain slumped back against the wall, his arms fell to his side and he dropped the axe on the floor. There were no memories left, and he stared up into the light with the innocence of a child. [PARAGRAPH]"It's okay. " Anna said as she stepped forward and took his large calloused hand in hers. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 17[PARAGRAPH]As the light exploded out of the small house's cellar Mahon and Gosea both fled out into the street. [PARAGRAPH]"Take the Heartstone. " Gosea said, pushing the delicately wrapped package into Mahon's hands. "Get it to Tebryn, get out of this city. "[PARAGRAPH]"I won't leave you alone. " Mahon argued. [PARAGRAPH]City guards carrying lanterns were already flooding onto the street, the site of the house still bursting with light caused them to pause briefly, but they would see Ma-hon and Gosea soon. [PARAGRAPH]"I am never alone. " Gosea said. "Get over the wall, now!"[PARAGRAPH]Mahon turned to look at the nearly 40 foot tall stone wall, "I'm going to need some help. " he said to himself. [PARAGRAPH]Gosea turned toward the guards and was careful to stay away from any of the beams of light streaming out of the house. [PARAGRAPH]"Sino, Vulnero, Dolor, Carcer, Ictus. . . " and on Gosea went, naming the myriad of spirits bound into her rings, runes and tattoos. At each name a spirit flew from her, a few, then dozens as her calls blurred together and became as wild and powerful as a storm at sea. Each spirit followed her command and jumped into the lanterns the guards carried, possessing the fire, gathering the oil about them and then leaping out onto the guards or the surrounding buildings. [PARAGRAPH]Guards screamed and rolled on the ground, but these flames couldn't simply be doused, they would leap off the guards and leap back. Guards tried patting each other down, or throwing their cloaks on each other, but it only caused confusion and the flames continued to dance among them. [PARAGRAPH]"Obey me" Gosea shouted as she flung her hands up over her head, away from the guards and toward the wall. As one, all of the flames streaked through the night air like dragonfire and struck the wall, sending oil straying in all directions, creating a pillar of thick, black smoke. But the wall had survived sieges, outside of some char marks it was unaffected. [PARAGRAPH]Commander Marlowe and Mikel reached the street in time to see the scattered guards still trying to understand what had happened. Marlowe immediately began shouting orders for the men to form up and prepare to rush the house, a squad was ordered to start triaging buckets of water and the injured were pulled back behind the lines. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel saw Gosea and Mahon standing silhouetted by the fire burning against the city wall. [PARAGRAPH]"Wait, Mikel. " Marlowe yelled, "They aren't going anywhere, they are trapped. "[PARAGRAPH]"No, they're not. " Mikel yelled back as he drew his sword and charged toward them. [PARAGRAPH]"Go!" Gosea shouted to Mahon. Spurred on by her words he sprinted toward the burning wall. Gosea turned to face Mikel, and her face was as pale and impassive as the moon. Even shadowed by the burning wall behind her Mikel could still see those immutable dark eyes. [PARAGRAPH]"Surrender!" Mikel shouted. [PARAGRAPH]Gosea didn't reply. Meaning to push quickly by her, Mikel dipped down, sweeping his sword low, below her arm and towards her thigh for a cut that would be painful, but not lethal. [PARAGRAPH]At the last moment Gosea moved toward Mikel, stabbing at him from a thin dagger in a hand that had appeared empty. The dagger went right through Mikel's arm, catching itself between the twin bones of the forearm and digging all the way through until its point poked out of the other side of his arm. This stopped his swing and she used his momentum, and her leverage to spin him around. [PARAGRAPH]Blinded by pain Mikel slammed the metal gloved fist of his other hand into Gosea's face. The witch's head snapped back, her nose shattered and her facial features swam as bones broke and gave way under the force. She let go of her knife and collapsed backwards onto the street. [PARAGRAPH]Nearly choking on blood Gosea spoke one more name, "Peractio. "[PARAGRAPH]A winged serpent the size of a man burst painfully up out of Gosea. Flowing from every part of her it filled her mouth, her nose, her ears and though she tried to scream, the serpent kept her from doing so. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel pulled the dagger out of his arm and switched his sword to the other hand just in time to block the serpent's first attack. Though his sword cut right across the serpent's body, the steel did not injure the demonic creature. [PARAGRAPH]The serpent lunged again and Mikel was forced to back up against the house. In the distance he could see Gosea struggling to get back up on her feet and the end of Mahon's sprint toward the burning wall. Instead of being stopped by the wall Mahon jumped up and stepped on the billowing smoke, riding it up and continuing to jump from black, ashy plume to plume to the top of the wall. [PARAGRAPH]With his back to the small house Mikel ducked another attack by the serpent and brought his sword up in a wide arch, an attack the serpent easily avoided as his sword plunged into one of the house's closed shutters. With his weapon trapped the serpent hissed, his eyes were cold, black and empty and for a brief second Mikel was lost in the utter lack of passion or rage in them. [PARAGRAPH]Then Mikel ripped the shutter off of the window and the serpent was bathed in the streaming white light bursting out of the house. The creature howled the sound of wind rushing down an endless pit and broke apart like oil consumed by fire. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 18[PARAGRAPH]Gosea was quickly apprehended. The enigmatic witch was gone, replaced by a scared young woman who cursed the guards, the city and Lugus loudly and with great fervor. Though riders were sent from the gate to chase down Mahon, he wasn't found. [PARAGRAPH]But it was Marlowe's voice that drew Mikel's attention. The soldiers had charged into the house, whose light was beginning to dim, and the commander's voice thundered above the burning fire, the screaming witch, and the growing amount of soldiers rushing into the square. It was a call of something more important than battle and demons and Mikel rushed to get to him. [PARAGRAPH]The soldiers parted as Mikel rushed into the house where his wife and daughter stood smiling and uninjured. Mikel swept them both up into his arms. It was hours before he let go of either of them. [PARAGRAPH]</French>
		<German>Gosea can channel spirits, usually demons, but has no ability to control them. Instead they possess her and use her as a puppet. She has power, but no will, and she is helpless to be anything but a victim to the forces that control her. [PARAGRAPH:4]Fideism[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 1[PARAGRAPH]Stained glass windows decorated the walls of the Fenestran temple. The windows were so large the walls seemed more glass than stone. The windows on the east favored yellow while those on the west side of the temple favored orange which caused the airy temple to change hue throughout the day. [PARAGRAPH]The temples dome was topped by a plain round window so at noon, as it was now, it was at its brightest. The light reflected off the temples polished bronze columns, leaving few shadows in the large room. The rooms focus was at its center where a pillar of light fell on a priest wearing pale yellow robes and the man that knelt before him. A small group of friends and family dotted the first few pews of the temple, a modest but proud turnout. [PARAGRAPH]"In duty and honor I consecrate this man to you dear Lugus, rose of summer. So that his life and spirit may be yours, to use and guide as you see fit. Bless him and keep him in your care as he remains vigilant to your will and that of the church. "[PARAGRAPH]"Arise Mikel Alaunus, new man of Bourne. " the priest continued. "As a humble servant of Lugus and this city I consecrate you as captain Alaunus, champion of the dawn, holy knight in the army of Bourne the Gleaming. Arise and accept the mandate of truth, throw your secrets away and join the revealing light of Lugus. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel stood. He was nearly a head taller than the young priest and his broad shoulders were evident even beneath the loose ceremonial tunic. His skin was the color of copper, as compared to the milky cast of the others in the room, and where his tunic fell low on his neck the black swirl of a tattoo could be seen. Mikel wasn't afraid of the mandate of truth, but public speaking, even to this small crowd, made him nervous. [PARAGRAPH]"I grew up in an orphanage in Galveholm, capital of the Sheaim empire. " Mikel began. "The orphanage wasn't like those here in Bourne. It wasn't a place to raise children, it was a place to store them. Galveholm is a brutal, violent city, full of promise and power for those willing to take it, and little protection for anyone else. "[PARAGRAPH]"I killed a man, a boy really, when I was twelve. His name was Augess and though he was only a year younger, he was small for his age. I struck out of habit more than any real malice, but he was angry at the way we treated him. He attacked me. He was in a rage, but still too weak to hurt me. I became angry too, and I killed him in the orphanage stairwell surrounded by the cruel cheers of the other boys. "[PARAGRAPH]"By the time I was fifteen I had killed two more. I was a murderer, an extortionist, a thief and a liar. My skill with a sword made me useful to cruel men. But when the man I worked for was assassinated, when others who worked for him began to die, I fled. "[PARAGRAPH]"I worked on caravans and ships before ending up in Bourne. I knew as soon as I saw this city I wanted to stay here. The cities high white walls, the battlements that seemed to be topped with gold and the cathedrals that dotted the city's skyline were all so different from the twisted towers and dark alleys of Galveholm. "[PARAGRAPH]"I was nearly arrested when I tried to enter the city. I am Sheaimic by birth and my tattoos are not only evidence of my past, but illegal in Bourne. After speaking with Gate Captain Marlowe he agreed to allow me my freedom if I worked on a local farm and stayed out of the city. I did so, working for Ferris Tawns, for just over three years. "[PARAGRAPH]"Ferris was a wonderful boss, and the years spent on his farm were my happiest to that point in my life. "[PARAGRAPH]Ferris and his wife, who were sitting near the back of the small group, didn't display any emotion at the praise. This wasn't simple appreciation, but a religious ceremony and everyone understood that regardless of what was revealed, the mandate of truth wasn't about those in the story, it was about the speaker. [PARAGRAPH]"I am ashamed to say I stole from Ferris while I worked from him. Though he shared his table with me, and paid me well I stole small things I could sell to traders on the road. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel was relieved to notice Ferris and his wife remained stoic. That was harder for him to admit than the murders. Failing after changing his life seemed like a bigger loss than the things he had done before. [PARAGRAPH]"Gate Captain Marlowe kept in touch with me and made sure his mercy was well placed. He eventually allowed me to travel with Ferris to the city's market to sell produce, and I enjoyed those trips. I befriended the market guards and when they were looking for new recruits, with Ferris and Marlowe's blessing, I applied. "[PARAGRAPH]"I have been working in the market for the past seven years. It was where I met my wife Deirdre, who I love deeply. We have been married for five years and four years ago we had a daughter, Anna. "[PARAGRAPH]Anna was unable to maintain the stoic expression and beamed at the mention of her name. Though Deirdre looked outwardly passive and listening, Mikel knew she was nearly as nervous as he was. The mandate of truth caused a lot of new knights to reveal past infidelities and crimes that sometimes destroyed families. Mikel was delighted he had no transgressions against his marriage, wife or daughter to admit. [PARAGRAPH]"Shortly after Anna's birth I began to feel drawn to the cities temples. Deirdre's father had been a knight commander in the church and gave his life in service to Lugus. My friend and fellow guardsman Ceth spent many shifts talking about his faith and the Empyrean . In time I began attending dawn rituals with him and my family. "[PARAGRAPH]"Three weeks ago I was offered the opportunity to become a knight in the service of Lugus and lead my own guard unit on the north bridge. I am undeserving of this honor, but I will give my devotion, my life, and my eternal soul, to the service of Lugus and to this city. "[PARAGRAPH]At this Mikel knelt again. [PARAGRAPH]The priest rubbed his thumb in a small pot on his belt, scooping out honey colored oil which he rubbed on Mikel's closed eyes. [PARAGRAPH]"Remember you carry the mandate of truth with you always. " the priest intoned. "Open your eyes to a world without deception, live your life revealed and without fear. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel opened his eyes. The oil burned and through the amber haze the bright temple appeared even brighter. Mikel could hear the people in the pews standing up and talking to each other, friends congratulating his wife. But he could only see a dizzying dance of light. The stained glass windows, once beautiful but lifeless, now glowed with an inner fire that made them seem alive. Angels and saints of the Empyrean looked down at him in full radiant glory. And one, an angel with a crescent shaped shield and a hand lost to golden light, seemed to float apart from the window. The angel looked down at Mikel with a look of passive benevolence. The angel reached out its burning hand, as if to touch Mikel on the forehead. But the light was too bright and although Mikel's eyes teared up as he tried to watch the vision, he was forced to blink and the room returned to normal. The angel was once again just a figure in the window. [PARAGRAPH]With one last look at the window Mikel turned back to the priest. [PARAGRAPH]"Thank you Literal Edain," Mikel said to the priest, "It is an honor I will give my life to uphold. "[PARAGRAPH]The priest smiled, but said nothing. [PARAGRAPH]"Is any sort of donation customary?" Mikel added quietly, embarrassed he was unaware of the protocol. [PARAGRAPH]"No my son," the priest said patting Mikel's hand. "You do a great service for our god. It is I who should be thanking you. Go and enjoy the day and your family. Though I expect to see you for morning devotions. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course eyeman . "[PARAGRAPH]The rest of the small group joined in congratulating Mikel. But Mikel found himself glancing back at the window that showed the angel with the crescent shield. After a few minutes Mikel was able to break away and ask the priest about it. [PARAGRAPH]"Literal Edain, who is the angel in the third eastern window?" Mikel asked. "The one with the crescent shield?"[PARAGRAPH]The priest stopped putting away the objects from the ceremony and looked at the window as if trying to remember. [PARAGRAPH]"I believe his name is Verchiel. Nearly sixty years ago, soon after this temple was first built, an occisor chased two children in here. A nine year old girl named Amelie and her brother, who was a few years younger. Amelie fell at the foot of the altar and prayed for help while her brother tried to fight the occisor. The boy was killed, but when the occisor went for Amelie, Verchiel protected her. The occisor fled from the temple and Amelie devoted her life to the Empyrean. "[PARAGRAPH]After a pause the priest added, "Why do you ask?"[PARAGRAPH]"The oil. . . " Mikel said clumsily, "I mean, I thought I saw that angel move during the ceremony. "[PARAGRAPH]"That is good. " Edain said, though Mikel couldn't tell if he was being patronizing or if visions like his were so common that the priest was unimpressed by it. Edain patted Mikel's arm and without saying more went back to storing the altar cloth in the small recess behind the altar. [PARAGRAPH]Deirdre approached the altar still beaming with pride at her husband. Anna followed her mother, anxious to hug her father but unsure if she was allowed to come close yet. Anna beamed up at Mikel with a smile identical to her mother's as he scooped her up in his arms. [PARAGRAPH]"My mother has a carriage ready, I think she is almost as proud of you as I am. " Deirdre whispered as she hugged Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 2[PARAGRAPH]At dawn the next morning Mikel was back at the temple. It was nearly full as the crowd went through morning devotions, alternatively sitting in quiet reflection, open prayer, and listening to Literal Edain speak. This morning Edain talked about Bridgit, the archangel of Bhall, who remained true to her goddess's mandate of divine passion even as Bhall fell to the whispers of Agares. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth sat on one side of Mikel, and Deirdre on the other. Anna sat on her mother's lap dutifully listening to the sermon, her eyes wide with wonder. She had blue ribbons in her blond hair, and in the yellow light of the temple her hair seemed to be made of gold. [PARAGRAPH]With a whispered blessing Literal Edain dismissed the congregation and almost as one the crowd rose to leave. Mikel interrupted the group funneling out to give his wife and daughter a quick kiss. [PARAGRAPH]"I will see you tonight. " Mikel whispered. Then to Ceth he added, "Can you wait for me? I want to speak to the eyeman. "[PARAGRAPH]Ceth nodded and stepped outside to get out of the way of those leaving behind him. After a hug Deirdre and her mother took Anna out into the city, already talking about their plans for the day. Mikel waited until the temple was clear before he approached Edain. [PARAGRAPH]"Eyeman, do you have a minute?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course. " Edain said sitting in the first pew and signaling Mikel to sit beside him. "What is it?"[PARAGRAPH]"It's about the mandate of truth. I have a question about when it is appropriate. "[PARAGRAPH]Edain sat passively, giving no indication if these sorts of questions were expected or unusual after someone has been through the ceremony. [PARAGRAPH]"I am a part of a lie, but it is not my secret. " Mikel said, "My mother-in-law believes I met Dierdre while working as a guard in the market, that I saved her from a thief. The truth is, we met when I caught Deirdre stealing from one of the merchants. "[PARAGRAPH]Again there was no indication if this surprised Edain or not. [PARAGRAPH]"I want to be honest with my mother-in-law, but I don't want to violate my wife's trust. What does the mandate of truth require of me? What does Lugus ask?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Edain offered a practiced smile. "The mandate of truth is a heavy burden. One that cannot be forced on any man, and must be accepted willingly. You cannot force your wife to live under its restrictions just because you do. To do so is to invite secrets between you, and the purpose of the mandate of truth is to live without secrets. "[PARAGRAPH]Edain paused before continuing. "But, you should encourage your wife to be honest in all things. This lie does not protect her, it traps her. One cannot change the past simply by saying it is not so. Speaking personally I have known AnnaSophia for many years, and I have no doubt she will have compassion for her daughter if she is told the truth. "[PARAGRAPH]"Yes eyeman. " Mikel said, "You are right. Thank you. "[PARAGRAPH]After another thanks Mikel headed out of the temple, where Ceth waited for him. They were a few blocks from the north bridge and the walk was a good way to warm up on the cold morning. [PARAGRAPH]The north bridge was unguarded during the winter. The few that crossed it were local farmers and traders, and even they were infrequent. But once the northern passes opened, activity would increase until it became one of the busiest bridges in Bourne. [PARAGRAPH]When it was built the bridge was wide enough that one of the aspen trees that grew along the rivers northern bank could have been laid across it. But since that time merchants had setup stalls on both sides of the bridge and there was barely room left for two caravans to pass. [PARAGRAPH]When Mikel and Ceth arrived the gates at both ends of the bridge were closed. Mikel unlocked each and turned to look at the empty stalls and the bridge tower. A deer stood in the woods at the north end of the bridge watching the two men. [PARAGRAPH]"Are we supposed to protect the city from the deer?" Ceth asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Laugh now, in a few weeks you will have more than enough work. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"By work you mean sitting by the tower watching caravans roll by, right?" Ceth said. [PARAGRAPH]"Right, and the occasional patrol up and down the bridge. But don't worry, we have some real work today. " Mikel said unlocking the bridge tower and opening it to stuffy room with a small jail, desk and armory. A nest of webs filled the corners of the room and the dried husks of rats hung in the webbing. [PARAGRAPH]"Today we clean. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"Then who is going to keep an eye on the deer?" Ceth said disgusted. [PARAGRAPH]The spider was nearly the size of a man's head, and both the men were glad there was no one else on the bridge to hear their screams as they chased and eventually killed it. They spent the rest of the day cleaning the tower. They accepted a small shipment of weapons and armor, stored them in the armory and then sat outside the tower and watched the river and the leafless woods beyond for the rest of the afternoon. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 3[PARAGRAPH]Just as Mikel promised, within a few weeks the bridge was alive with activity. All of the stalls were open with merchants hawking their wares to passing caravans, and it was rare to have a moment without at least one caravan on the bridge. The woods on the north bank were now green, the days were warmer and Mikel had ten guards, including his lieutenant Ceth, assigned to the north bridge and reporting to him. [PARAGRAPH]"Come down off my wagons!"[PARAGRAPH]The scream was angry, though it was easily lost in the chaos of people arguing over the price of goods, yelling for people to move out of the way of wagons and the sounds of various mules, oxen and chickens scattered over the bridge. [PARAGRAPH]"Guardsman!" an angry merchant yelled, looking at Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]"Captain," Mikel corrected, "and what can I do for you?"[PARAGRAPH]"There is a man, a thief, rooting through my goods. " the merchant exclaimed. He was a large man and his face was bright red with anger. He looked to be about to climb up onto the wagon where a wiry man poked beneath the tarps that covered it, if he could manage to lift his bulk up off the road, which didn't seem likely. [PARAGRAPH]"Greylin," Mikel called, "get off the wagon. I've warned you about this before. "[PARAGRAPH]"Mikel, tell him I'm no thief. I'm just checking to see what he has for sale. " Then turning to the red faced merchant Greylin added, "How much do you want for these radishes? I could take the whole batch off your hands. "[PARAGRAPH]Cutting off the merchant before he started to scream again, Mikel said "Now Greylin, or it's a night in the cell. "[PARAGRAPH]With a look of disappointment Greylin climbed down. "The real thieves are in the market, they won't pay anything for these goods. They don't offer fair deals to outsiders. Not like me, I respect a man who traveled all the way to Bourne. You don't have to be my cousin's sister's whatever to get a fair deal from me. "[PARAGRAPH]"Greylin is harmless. " Mikel said to the merchant whose face was returning to a normal color, "And he isn't a thief, though he is overeager. You won't have any more problems with him. " Mikel said this last point loud enough that Greylin could hear him. [PARAGRAPH]After making sure the merchant wasn't going to attack Greylin, Mikel headed back and sat down outside the guard tower beside Ceth. The two rarely had a chance to work together since Ceth was the bridge lieutenant and in charge of the bridge during shifts Mikel wasn't working. [PARAGRAPH]"Is it any better at night?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"It's not this crowded. But it's steady until dusk, then we get a rush of activity as people try to get into or out of the city. We never get the gates closed on time. " then Ceth added, "I was going to ask Donovan if he could work tonight. Fenton is sick, covered with boils if his wife is to be believed, and I'm down a man. "[PARAGRAPH]"Donovan is sick too, sounds like he may have the same thing. We only have three men on the bridge today. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"Think they may be all off drinking somewhere?" Ceth said half-joking. [PARAGRAPH]"I saw Donovan. " Mikel said, "He looked horrible. A bunch of people in the city have been getting sick, most get better in a few days. I can cover for Fenton, maybe I can talk Deirdre into bringing us some dinner. "[PARAGRAPH]"Are you sure? I can ask someone else. " Ceth said. [PARAGRAPH]"It's no problem, but you have to pay me back by sticking around and covering Donovan's shift for the rest of the day. "[PARAGRAPH]The rest of the day went smoothly. Just as Ceth described there was a rush of activity just before the gates closed and by the time the dusk bells rang throughout Bourne the gates were all still open. Finally a little more than an hour later they were closed and locked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel locked the guard tower and met Ceth for a final walk down to check in with the overnight guards on the north side of the bridge. Walking down they were surprised to see three figures walking toward them. It was too dark to see clearly but it looked to be a woman flanked by two men. One of the men was a bear of a man, thick through the chest and shoulders. He plodded forward with all the grace of a boulder rolling down hill. The other man was the opposite, he was almost lost in the silhouette of his cloak. A slight turn and this man stepped into the shadows of one of the merchant stalls and disappeared. [PARAGRAPH]"Halt. " Ceth called lifting his spear. The two figures they could still see continued walking forward as if they hadn't heard him. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel's hand went instinctively to his sword hilt. Something about these people worried him. The gate guards wouldn't allow anyone on the bridge after closing. And the way one of the companions disappeared spoke to a skill beyond simple travelers. Mikel hadn't even drawn his sword other than to care for it since being assigned to the bridge. He had used his sap a few times and sometimes threatened to use a short cudgel he carried. But this was the first time he was tempted to draw his sword. A blue ribbon tied around the swords hilt reminded him to stay calm. [PARAGRAPH]"Careful," Mikel whispered to Ceth, "there were three of them. "[PARAGRAPH]They were now close enough to see each other. The woman was the most notable, with pale alabaster skin that made her look almost ghostlike in the moonlight. She wore burgundy robes so dark Mikel first mistook them for black, her hair was long and black and her eyes were dark pools. She was beautiful, as long as you avoided her eyes, which were cold and empty. [PARAGRAPH]Her bearlike companion wore a horsehair cloak and worn leather armor. He held a thick double bladed axe casually in his hand, it dripped with a dark liquid. Mikel could see the swirl of black tatoo's sticking out from beneath his leather bracers. [PARAGRAPH]"Sheaim!" Mikel yelled, hand going to his sword. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth lowered his spear, pointing it threateningly at the woman as he stepped towards her. She ignored him, throwing her head back as if to howl. But instead of making any noise Mikel felt a sudden pressure on his ears and head that was so strong it made him dizzy. Not only did the woman make no noise, everything went perfectly silent. The sound of the wind blowing across the tarps over merchant stalls disappeared, the sounds of the river lapping against the bridges foundations was gone, only perfect empty silence remained. [PARAGRAPH]It was silent as the man with the double bladed axe walked towards Mikel. Silent as Ceth approached the woman. Ceth shook his head and looked at Mikel in confusion, whatever was affecting Mikel was affecting him as well. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel drew his sword in time to parry the axeman's attack. He could now see that the liquid on the axe was fresh blood, and he had little doubt it was from the overnight guards. This axeman could have been any of the kids that grew up in the orphanage with him. He had the same copper colored skin, and the same delight on his face at the opportunity to cause pain. [PARAGRAPH]But Mikel was not a simple guardsman grown soft settling disputes between merchants. With force the axeman wasn't expecting Mikel parried the axe and brought an armored elbow up hard against the side of the axeman's face. Suddenly the look of delight was gone, replaced by anger. [PARAGRAPH]The cloaked man that had slipped into the shadows came out. He stepped between Ceth and the woman, and when Ceth lunged with his spear he leapt up and landed easily on the end of Ceth's spear. [PARAGRAPH]There he stood, almost frozen, an axe in each hand and seemingly without affecting the weight of spear at all. Ceth stood unbelieving. First the silence and now this man stood on the tip of his spear as if balancing on a tightrope. The scene had an eerie dreamlike quality. [PARAGRAPH]Meanwhile the axeman Mikel was fighting continued to swing wildly. Mikel drew his cudgel in his left hand and it was quickly destroyed by the powerful axe. Another parry and an elbow to the axeman's face sent the axeman stumbling backwards, cursing soundlessly. Mikel didn't waste the opportunity and stabbed the axeman's exposed side, just below his kidney and through until stopped by the leather plate on the axeman's back. The axeman stumbled back further and fell, a dark pool quickly welled around the wound. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth tried to shake his spear, to knock off the man standing on it. But instead the man ran up the length of the spear. Coming up nearly to Ceth's hand the attacker swung his twin axes, catching Ceth's throat and sending a bright red arch of blood high into the air, some even struck Mikel, though he was over three meters away. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth went back, head down hard into the stone bridge. He dropped the spear and the man nimbly landed on the ground, turning toward Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]The woman stopped her silent howl and sound returned with another dizzying pop of pressure. [PARAGRAPH]"Leave him, run. " the woman said pointing toward the south end of the bridge. Together the two started running toward the city. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel fell at Ceth's side, ignoring the fleeing attackers and the axeman lying wounded on the bridge. Ceth's eyes were spinning wildly in fear and confusion, but they stopped when they locked onto Mikel's. He tried to speak but that only caused more blood to spill out of his open throat. Mikel clasped both hands over Ceth's throat, trying in vain to stop the bleeding, though blood continued to pour through his fingers. [PARAGRAPH]"Please, please, please. " Mikel whispered, trying to contain the horror rushing through him. A deep breath and his thoughts focused, his fear was gone. [PARAGRAPH]"Please, Lugus, lord of the dawn, do not forget us. " Mikel whispered, "Do not let him die. He has seen too few days. Share your mercy and your light with him. "[PARAGRAPH]There was a sudden heat through Mikel's fingers and he felt Ceth gasp. Opening his eyes Mikel saw Verchiel, the angel in the temple, kneeling on the other side of Ceth, mirroring Mikel's pose. Verchiel was praying too, and where the angel's hands passed through Mikel's he felt heat and power. [PARAGRAPH]Any shock or surprise was gone in this moment. Mikel only cared about saving Ceth and did not question the appearance of the glowing angel. Verchiel appeared much like a stained glass window, his skin was golden and slightly translucent and an inner light seemed to radiate from him. He wore modest white robes trimmed in yellow and he had the same crescent shaped bronze shield decorated with beautifully faceted gemstones. [PARAGRAPH]As the warmth faded Verchiel looked up into Mikel's face. "There is a sickness within Bourne. If you have faith we can heal the city. "[PARAGRAPH]"I do, I will. " said Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]At that Verchiel spread his wings, appearing exactly as he did in the window, and disappeared. [PARAGRAPH]"Mikel," Ceth said straining through Mikel's pressure on his throat, "what happened?"[PARAGRAPH]Mikel removed his hands to see two long scars on Ceth's throat. They were thick and bright red, but completely closed and the skin around the wounds looked fresh and healthy. [PARAGRAPH]"The angel healed you. " Mikel said, though he realized how strange those words sounded. [PARAGRAPH]Both men were broken out of their thoughts by the sound of the axeman Mikel had stabbed trying to get up. The axeman grabbed his side, weak from the loss of blood. Despite his obvious pain he was already standing and he raised his axe menacingly. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel rolled up and charged the axeman. Mikel's sword knocked the axe easily aside and Mikel set his shoulder low and into the axeman's chest. The axeman flew backwards, losing hold of his axe as he slammed into the side of a merchant stall and then fell hard against the ground. This time nothing silenced him and his cries were loud and profane. [PARAGRAPH]"I'll take care of him. " Ceth said picking himself up and grabbing his cudgel. [PARAGRAPH]"Are you sure you are okay?" Mikel said, but Ceth moved quickly, rolling the cursing axeman over and tying his hands. Despite the stains of blood on his neck, face and breastplate Ceth was completely recovered from the attack. [PARAGRAPH]"I'm going to warn the city guard, put him in the cell. " Mikel said. Then, without waiting for Ceth's answer, Mikel ran south along the bridge, chasing after the woman and the other attacker. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 4[PARAGRAPH]Mikel couldn't help feeling negligent in missing the next morning's dawn ceremony. As the morning bells rang out through the city he was sitting in a very crowded north bridge tower. Ceth was here as was Mikel's senior officer, Knight Commander Marlowe, and a crowd of other officers and priests. [PARAGRAPH]One of these priests was questioning the axeman, who gave his name as Cain the Torn, and who remained locked in the towers single cell. Mikel listened to the questioning as he and Ceth recounted their memories of the attack. [PARAGRAPH]"Cain, do you think your companions could have overcome the guard captain on their own?" the priest asked the prisoner. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes. " Cain answered. [PARAGRAPH]"Then why would you protect them if they abandoned you so easily? You would be dead if not for our care, left to die or be arrested while they escaped. There are two dead guardsmen, and nearly a third but for the grace of Lugus. Would you bear the burden for these crimes alone?"[PARAGRAPH]Cain didn't answer. He was still pale from the loss of blood and leaned against the cell wall. It was obvious the priest's persistent questions were having some impact on him. Seeing Cain wasn't going to respond the priest tried a different tact. [PARAGRAPH]"Cain, do you have a family. A wife and children?"[PARAGRAPH]"I did. " Cain answered, "I was much worse then. I lost control and killed them. "[PARAGRAPH]Cain seemed to be lost in the memory of the event. His answer quieted the rest of the people in the room, but the priest continued undeterred. [PARAGRAPH]"It is good you admit that. You would not want to die with that burden upon you. You can be forgiven, you can find peace. But this woman, she wanted you to continue killing, to use you. "[PARAGRAPH]"She. . . " Cain said looking up at the people in the room, "knows who I really am. "[PARAGRAPH]"It is not who you have to be. " the priest continued, "Your wife, she saw a different man. She knew who you really are. "[PARAGRAPH]"No," Cain said with emotion, "not until the night I killed her. That was the first time she really saw me. "[PARAGRAPH]The priest continued questioning but Cain didn't offer any further information, and nothing about his companions. Forgiveness and repentance may appeal to those raised in Bourne, but Mikel wasn't surprised the Sheaimic axeman was uninterested in the concepts. [PARAGRAPH]"This is a miracle. " Knight Commander Marlowe said placing his hand on Mikel's shoulder. "A vision, a warning and the life of one of our guardsman saved. This is a blessing not only to you but the city itself. It is an honor that Lugus would intervene. "[PARAGRAPH]"Yes sir. " Mikel said, "I feel like I should be at the dawn ceremony now, or out looking for the woman and the other man. "[PARAGRAPH]"A soldier always wants to be doing. But you are a part of the city, and without moving you are accomplishing both. Runners have been sent to all of the temples and guard stations in Bourne. The guards are all looking for them, and thanks are being offered in all the temples. " Marlowe answered. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel was surprised, he knew the runners had been sent to the guard stations, he had started that process last night. But knowing the priests were being told about his vision made him self-conscious. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth had it even worse. The priests were taking turns investigating the scars on his neck and treating him like a sacred relic. He had been choking on blood until, as if waking from a bad dream, the pain was gone. He thought he was dead except for the flood of cool night air in his lungs. Ceth hadn't seen the angel or known about it until Mikel told him. [PARAGRAPH]"Tomorrow why don't you and Ceth come to the dawn ritual at the Cathedral of Bells ? I am sure Luminary Rimmon would like to meet you. "[PARAGRAPH]"It would be an honor. " Mikel said, though the prospect of meeting the high priest of Bourne made him more nervous than the fight on the bridge. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth agreed to the invitation and the two stayed long enough to sign Cain over to the city guard, who would transport him to city prison. After stopping to give instruction to the day watch, Mikel set off for Dierdre's mother's manor. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel had sent a runner to Dierdre less than an hour after the fight, giving her a short explanation of what had happened and asking her to go to her mother's house to be safe. Mikel had ordered the runner to escort her to her mother's house. [PARAGRAPH]Dierdre's father had been a knight commander in charge of a thousand men. He died on the battlefield, giving his life for Lugus and Bourne in the autumn just after Dierdre's eighth birthday. Before he died he built the squat stone manor, now called Wyn Manor. [PARAGRAPH]The manor had four wings, but since Dierdre's mother AnnaSophia lived in it alone only the east wing remained open. Dierdre met Mikel as he entered the kitchen door the family most commonly used. AnnaSophia was in the kitchen behind her daughter pouring tea. Anna, who had tried to wait up for her father's return, had finally succumbed to sleep and was lost in a tangle of blankets on a couch in the adjoining great room. [PARAGRAPH]"What happened?" Dierdre said, unaccustomed to any change in the normal guard schedule. [PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia, whose marriage contained many mornings like this shooed her daughter away from the door and offered Mikel a seat at the kitchen table, which he gladly dropped into. Mikel didn't have time to speak before a cup of hot tea was placed before him, along with some dry rolls and a small pot of butter. [PARAGRAPH]"Thank you," Mikel mumbled as he ripped off a piece of bread and stuffed it in his mouth. [PARAGRAPH]Noticing Mikel was still covered with sweat and the spray of blood AnnaSophia went to wet a rag for him to clean off with. Before she could do so Dierdre also noticed the dried blood splattered line across his breastplate. [PARAGRAPH]"Is that blood?" Dierdre asked, her voice rising. [PARAGRAPH]"Quiet Diery. " AnnaSophia said, indicating where Anna slept. "Let Mikel eat a bit first, he is here and safe. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel quickly finished eating and washed the blood off his armor while he told both of the women what happened. Dierdre was stunned by Mikel's description of the angel and Ceth's healing, but AnnaSophia only listened carefully and waited until the story was complete to ask her question. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you tell anyone about your vision?" AnnaSophia asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes, of course, I told Knight Commander Marlowe and it was relayed to the guard stations and to the temples before dawn. "[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia's looked down, her brow furrowed, seemingly intent on the crumbs she was sweeping off the counter. [PARAGRAPH]"Do you think I shouldn't have?" Mikel asked. "Do you think I didn't really see an angel?"[PARAGRAPH]"I think you saw an angel. " AnnaSophia said quickly, "But I wonder how the church will accept your miracle and vision. These are rare events, it may be years before we hear of anything similar. What will the church expect of you because of it?"[PARAGRAPH]"They will know he is a hero. That the church did well to make him a captain. " Dierdre answered. [PARAGRAPH]"I am sure you are right. " AnnaSophia said, but she continued brushing off the counter though no crumbs remained. [PARAGRAPH]They talked for a few more minutes before Mikel's exhaustion began to catch up with him. After asking if he could borrow one of the guest bedrooms Mikel picked the sleeping Anna up off the couch and carried her into the bedroom where he placed her gently on the bed before collapsing beside her. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel's dreams where thick and muddy. The fight on the bridge mixed with those from his boyhood in Galveholm. He dreamt about Cain killing his wife and Herod Wyn, a man he had never met, who died in the service of Lugus leaving his wife widowed and his daughter fatherless. And though he searched in his dreams for another vision of the angel, it never came. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 5[PARAGRAPH]The noon bells woke Mikel. It had only been a few hours sleep, but it would have to be enough. He washed up before putting his armor back on. As he was putting his sword belt on he noticed his sword was still stained with Cain's blood. He took the sword out and cleaned it. [PARAGRAPH]The blood had even stained the blue ribbon tied around its hilt. Mikel felt suddenly angry he had been forced into a fight on the bridge, that they had attacked him and killed the other guards. That an angel had intervened and spoken with him, and that Ceth had been injured in the first place. He had hoped his days of sword fights were past. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel kissed Anna, who still lay sleeping peacefully on the bed, and headed down to the great room. [PARAGRAPH]Dierdre had taken her daughter's position on the couch and was snoring softly. AnnaSophia was still in the kitchen, though she peeked in when she heard Mikel before going back to her work. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel walked into the kitchen and saw she was packing a half loaf of bread, a bag of almonds and a fresh canteen. She set it out for him as Mikel entered the room. [PARAGRAPH]"Does this mean I'm leaving?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"If you stay I'll gladly cook you something better. But I don't think your coming downstairs for my cooking. " she answered. [PARAGRAPH]"No, you are right. " Mikel pocketed the food and the canteen then added, "Thank you for your help this morning. I was, I still am, overwhelmed. When Dierdre wakes up could you tell her to wait here for me and I'll come back tonight to walk her home. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course. " AnnaSophia said. [PARAGRAPH]With that Mikel headed out into the city on a walk to the city prison. It was a fair walk from Wyn Manor and he was glad to have the bread and almonds to snack on while he walked. [PARAGRAPH]Bourne was set in a series of low hills between the Fellin river, which the north bridge crossed, and the much larger Arduro straight to the south. The straight was too large for a bridge so the south side of Bourne was dominated by docks and warehouses. To protect the city from flooding a levee was built among the docks with a series of maze like sewer tunnels beneath. Since its construction the building has since been turned into the city prison, though it still goes by its original name, the Drain. [PARAGRAPH]A wall now surrounded the Drain and provided some protection from flood waters but Mikel felt nervous each time he entered the prison. [PARAGRAPH]"Afternoon captain. " a guard said as Mikel approached. Still fairly new to his role Mikel was surprised to see the respect accorded him by junior guards. And the few guarding the prison seemed even more impressed as they stood formally and one unlocked the outside gate to let him in. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel headed through the gate and down the gradually sloping stone staircase. Lamps were set in the walls, and though the staircase was clean and dry, moisture beaded on the walls. [PARAGRAPH]At the end the stairwell opened to the prisons main processing room. Almost a dozen guards worked here and four main shafts lead out to the converted cells. [PARAGRAPH]"Are you captain Alaunus?" a guard asked. He was sitting at a desk beside a woman draped in a cranberry shawl. [PARAGRAPH]At the mention of his name many of the guards, who had been talking to each other or filling out papers, stopped working and looked up. But the woman didn't turn. She sat facing the guard that had called for him, with her back to Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes I am. " Mikel said crossing the room to the guard's desk, "I was hoping to speak with Cain. I have a few questions about his purpose here in Bourne. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course captain. " the guard said. "He is in tunnel C. But we may have a witness that saw the woman who was traveling with Cain last night. " The guard indicated the woman sitting at his desk. [PARAGRAPH]The woman looked to be both frail and fierce. Her shawl was gathered tightly about her in the cool dungeon. The hands grasping at it were gaunt, little more than skin worn thin by years pulled over gnarled bone. But her clear grey eyes refused to admit weakness. She was angry, or annoyed, or her scowl was permanently fixed on her face. It was not a face accustomed to smiling. [PARAGRAPH]"Hello ma'am. " Mikel said. "I'm captain Mikel Alaunus of the north bridge. I fought with the woman and her guards last night. They killed two of my men. Can you describe the woman you saw?"[PARAGRAPH]The woman didn't answer, she just stared at Mikel in a way that made him feel guilty, though he wasn't sure what for. The guard broke the silence, reading from his notes. [PARAGRAPH]"Fisher Lizabeth Konal," the guard started, once again indicating the woman, "said her son was at the Sparrow last night being chatted up by young foreign lady who matched the description of the woman on the bridge. Pretty, with dark hair and cloak that was so dark red it was nearly black. She said any man in the bar would have been happy to pay for her, and didn't know why she would be wasting her time on her dullard of a son. "[PARAGRAPH]Seeing Mikel's look of surprise the guard quickly added, "That's from her description, not from me captain. "[PARAGRAPH]"Did you see her closely?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes, I went in to yell at my son. " Lizabeth answered, "To get him to the docks to work a shift but he was rooted to the bar stool as usual. That witch glared at me. I've seen more warmth in a corpse's eyes. " Her voice was a thin rasp entirely suited for her angry face. [PARAGRAPH]"Can we speak to your son?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"If you can find him. He's been missing since last night. " she answered. [PARAGRAPH]"We already have two men out looking for him and a patrol out searching the area around the Sparrow. " the guard added quickly. [PARAGRAPH]"Why would she want to talk to your son?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"No idea. The boy is as useless as a painting to a blind man. " she said. [PARAGRAPH]The old woman didn't seem willing to offer anything further. [PARAGRAPH]"Any thoughts soldier?" Mikel asked the guard. [PARAGRAPH]"No captain. By all accounts Anton Konal, that's her son, was a large man. Maybe a good six to nine inches taller than you. He was a guard for a brief time a few years ago but rarely reported to his shift and was let go. Now he spends his time drinking in the Sparrow, passed out on its floor or working as a dock hand. Fisher Konal's assessment of her son seems accurate. It's unlikely he is a secret Sheaim contact in the city, or of any real use to anyone. "[PARAGRAPH]Then, as if forgetting he was speaking in front of Anton's mother the guard added, "Sorry ma'am". [PARAGRAPH]"All true," she said. [PARAGRAPH]"It does sound like her. " Mikel said, "I will ask Cain about it. Soldier, if the patrol turns anything up would you let me know? I will be stationed at the north bridge tonight. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course captain. " the guard replied. [PARAGRAPH]After thanking Fisher Konal, Mikel headed down into Tunnel C. Mikel walked passed rows of cells, some empty and others filled with a mix of pickpockets, prostitutes and drunkards. After walking to the end of the first row and down a spiral staircase, Cain's cell became obvious. There was a small group of people standing outside it. [PARAGRAPH]Two guards stood silent watch outside the cell, another pair was inside. There was a man in an orange waistcoat who Mikel recognized as a local speaker, and a Literal with pale yellow robes was tending to a small brazier that was burning incense. Lastly captain Cerron, the head of the prison stood looking into the cell. Cerron noticed Mikel approaching. [PARAGRAPH]"Captain Alunus, welcome to the Drain. I'm sorry I haven't had a chance to make it out to the north bridge and congratulate you on your promotion yet. " Captain Cerron said. [PARAGRAPH]"Thank you captain," Mikel replied, "I know you are busy and it's only a matter of time before all the sentry captains get to meet with you. I am only sorry we couldn't be meeting over a less tragic incident. "[PARAGRAPH]"Yes, this one is a mystery. And I'm sorry to hear about your men. My son trained with soldier Ruen, he was a good man. " Cerron said. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes he was. " Mikel said. "How is the interrogation going?"[PARAGRAPH]"We haven't gotten much out of him. " Cerron answered. "He claims he and his companions were cutting through Bourne on their way to Galveholm and he doubts either of them are still in Bourne. He says the woman's name is Gosea and the other man's name was Mahon. The Literal is preparing for the kiss of the innocent so we know if he is lying or not. "[PARAGRAPH]"Do you mind if I ask him a few questions?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Captain Cerron checked with the speaker and the Literal, neither of which had any objection. [PARAGRAPH]"But I will need your weapons before you enter the cell. Just in case. " Cerron said. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel removed his sword belt and handed it to the captain. Then one of the guards unlocked the cell as the others stood ready for Cain to move. But Cain sat on a bench in the back of the cell with his head down and his curly hair hanging in front of his face. He didn't look up even as Mikel entered the cell, crossed it and sat down beside him. [PARAGRAPH]The two men were similar in size with deep coppery skin. They both had black hair and similar tattoos across their chest, back and arms. The connection was not lost on Mikel who was so accustomed to looking different that sitting by a man that could have been his brother was unsettling. [PARAGRAPH]"Have they told you about the kiss of the innocent?" Mikel began. With no sound from Cain he continued, "They heat a coal on the brazier, then pray over it. When their prayers are complete they will put it in your mouth. If you have been honest the coal will not burn you. If you have lied, then it will burn your mouth and tongue so badly you will never speak again. "[PARAGRAPH]"Do you believe that?" Cain asked, his head still down. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel was surprised by the question. He knew many questioned the impact of the gods in the world, but this was a man who traveled with a witch who could drink the sound out of an area and another who could stand on the end of a spear without adding any weight to it. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course I do. I have seen it performed many times. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"I've have some experience with torture. This technique is also used among the Sheaim but without the religious trappings. I think it originally came from the Bannor. It works because a lying man is more nervous, his mouth goes dry and the coal burns him. An innocent man has more moisture in his mouth so he isn't burned. That's assuming the coal is prepared at the right temperature. If it is too hot anyone will be burned by it. I suspect your preparation ritual is all about getting it to the correct temperature, at least I hope it is. " Cain said, finally looking up at where the Literal was still praying over the brazier. [PARAGRAPH]"Have you been honest?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Why wouldn't I be? The worst I've done you already know. I killed a couple of your men. I assume you are going to kill me for it. Why lie?"[PARAGRAPH]"Do you know where your companions are now?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Cain ignored the question. Looking at Mikel he asked, "Why did you become a rooster?"[PARAGRAPH]"I fled Galveholm because I was on the losing side of one of the street wars. I ended up here by accident, but I liked it. It was a better life and they are good people. Lugus revealed himself to me and allowed me to become something more than the thug and murderer I was. " Mikel answered. "In fact, that night on the bridge I saw an angel. It healed my lieutenant and told me there was a disease in Bourne I was to help cleanse. But it didn't tell me how. "[PARAGRAPH]"Why do you suppose the gods never tell us the whole story?" Cain asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I think it's because your friends are the disease and you know where they are. So I already have everything I need. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"You are wrong, I have no idea where they are. Probably halfway to Galveholm. I think the gods don't tell us the full story because if we knew how things were going to turn out, we would never follow them. " Cain said. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel considered Cain quietly. He didn't believe Cain was lying, but Mikel had been softened by years living in Bourne. People here were horrible liars, they became nervous and talkative. Among the Sheaim many had no guilt lying or killing, and they talked emotionlessly about both. [PARAGRAPH]"Your friend lived?" Cain asked. [PARAGRAPH]"My lieutenant, yes. The angel healed him. " Mikel answered. [PARAGRAPH]"Mahon isn't going to be happy about that. He likes to claim anytime he swings his axes, someone dies. As far as I know it has always been true. "[PARAGRAPH]"Do you think he will stay in Bourne long enough to kill Ceth?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"No, he will do what Gosea wants. And she is too practical to care about Mahon's streak or a guard that got away. " Cain said. [PARAGRAPH]"Any idea why Gosea was at a bar last night chatting up a local dock hand?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]For the first time Cain looked surprised. When Mikel asked again Cain denied knowing why she would be there, and this time Mikel was sure he was lying. Despite Mikel's attempts to get any more information Cain wouldn't talk. Hearing about the bar visit had scared him, or reinforced his loyalty. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel stayed long enough to watch the Literal place the coal in Cain's mouth. Though Cain attempted to take it willingly, to get the test over with quickly, his fear overcame him at the last second and he had to be restrained by the guards and the coal forced into his mouth. [PARAGRAPH]Cain was uninjured by the coal beyond some minor burns. It was enough for the Literal to proclaim he had been honest in all his answers. Mikel doubted that was the case. [PARAGRAPH]But it was getting close to time for the night shift. Though he felt like he hadn't gained any usable information Mikel thanked captain Cerron and headed out of the Drain on the long walk to the north bridge. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 6[PARAGRAPH]Anton Konal had been burning for nearly twenty hours. [PARAGRAPH]It hadn't been hard to lure him to the empty silo, he followed Gosea without complaint. Even though he towered over the petite witch, he hadn't tried to force himself on her. Instead he begged and offered clumsy compliments in an attempt to seduce her. Gosea was disgusted by him. [PARAGRAPH]The hard part was finding a place for the sacrifice. Since it was early spring many of the silos along the docks were empty, and Mahon found one large enough to construct what they needed without anyone seeing the fire. Gosea's magic would take care of the screams. [PARAGRAPH]Once Anton arrived Mahon tied him to the large post in the center of the empty silo. Anton was forced atop a pile of refuse from the docks, splintered crates and barrels, planks and rope. All were coated with lamp oil. [PARAGRAPH]Gosea lit the flames and they stood in perfect silence as Anton writhed in pain. The fire consumed his feet then up along his legs. His skin peeled and blackened, revealing thick layers of fat beneath that burned and melted like candle wax. There was so much fat on him that hot, liquid streams of it crawled down his legs and dripped hissing into the fire. [PARAGRAPH]In time he stopped screaming, but Gosea's magic wouldn't let him die. His voice was gone and the flames had eaten away all the unnecessary parts of him. Anton's massive frame, blackened and burnt, was little more than bones covered with thick muscle. [PARAGRAPH]That was when the ritual changed. Instead of being consumed by the fire Anton's body began consuming it. Mahon poured more lamp oil on the fire until the flames were as high as Anton's waist but Anton seemed empowered by it. The fire greedily licked at Anton's chest, arms and shoulders. It was absorbed and drawn into him. And over time a hot orange glow came from within his chest, and behind his eyes. [PARAGRAPH]There he stood, eyes fixed on Gosea in passive supplication. He was no longer alive, but unable to die. His most basic animalistic desires were tethered to his body by Gosea's spell. When the ritual was done Mahon cut him free and what had been Anton lumbered off the pyre, ready to receive Gosea's commands. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 7[PARAGRAPH]The midnight bells rang through the city. Dawn and noon were sacred times in Bourne, even dusk was seen as a time of reflection and rest. But there was little comfort in midnight. In the well ordered city this was the one time when strange things happened. And it was when the two guards standing attention at the Drain's outer gate spotted Anton Konal's corpse lumbering toward them. [PARAGRAPH]A cloak had been placed over him, but it was nearly burnt off. His body glowed like a coal, his skin and muscles were charred and black, but beneath the guards could see slivers of orange fire. Though the body lumbering toward them was on fire it was more terrifying that the flames didn't seem to bother it. [PARAGRAPH]The guards yelled for help before grabbing their spears. Neither had any desire to get close to the creature. [PARAGRAPH]They waited until they heard other guards running up the stairs out of the Drain before attacking. One stabbed Anton's corpse, and the creature made no attempt to avoid the spear. It punctured Anton's large chest and slid easily through. Anton hurried forward, up along the spear and grabbed the startled guard. His thick hands closed on the guards throats and the guards strangled screams were mixed with the pain of burning hands on his skin. [PARAGRAPH]"Shields men!" captain Cerron called, racing up the stairs behind his soldiers. "Do not waste yourself on lethal attacks, the creature has no vulnerable organs. Lop off any piece that gets close to you. "[PARAGRAPH]Following their orders the guards with shields readied them and closed with short blades and axes. Anton turned and the spear that was still stuck through him spun wildly, but when Anton reached for another soldier he was blocked by a shield. One guard sliced across Anton's back with a sword, and another, with a lucky blow from his axe, severed Anton's hand. [PARAGRAPH]Anton roared in anger. The places where he had been struck burned with an angry orange light. [PARAGRAPH]"Be patient men, we will bring this creature down. " Cerron called, readying his own shield as Anton's attention turned to him. [PARAGRAPH]Anton charged, and though two guards stabbed him with spears he ignored both attacks. One guard was whipped around by the force of the charging giant, the other spear snapped in half. [PARAGRAPH]Cerron dove toward the creature's left side. Though Anton had no hand on that arm he beat it furiously against the captain's shield like a giant club. Cerron deflected the attack and returned his own, ducking low and chopping into Anton's knee with his axe. [PARAGRAPH]Despite the lack of pain, or the need for lungs, heart or mind even the walking dead still need their knees. As the kneecap splintered Anton fell onto the street. [PARAGRAPH]The guards were quick to take advantage of the fall. Cerron spun to deliver another blow to the back of Anton's leg, nearly amputating it entirely. A flurry of other attacks rained down on the creature's body, each leaving an angry hot scar in its place. [PARAGRAPH]Anton shuddered and then his body exploded. With a final howl the flames were released from the prison of his burnt corpse and they swept out over the guards, the Drain front gate, and the surrounding buildings. The cobblestones burnt and fractured in the heat, the bodies of the soldiers did much worse. Helmets were melted to flesh, exposed skin was burnt down to bone. Cerron and his men were killed. [PARAGRAPH]There were only two guards left in the Drain, and they fell easily to Mahon's twin axes. [PARAGRAPH]"Split up and find Cain. " Gosea ordered, throwing Mahon the set of keys from one of the guards. "Let out anyone you find along the way. "[PARAGRAPH]Cain heard the explosion and knew what it was. By the time Gosea found his cell he was standing at the bars calling for her. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you tell them about the heartstone?" Gosea whispered as she unlocked his cell. [PARAGRAPH]"No, and they didn't ask about it. " Cain replied. "They just wanted to know where you were. I honestly told them I believed you would be halfway to Galveholm. "[PARAGRAPH]Gosea studied his face with eyes that revealed none of her thoughts. Then she handed Cain an axe she had taken from one of the guard's corpses. [PARAGRAPH]"Let us go. We don't have much time. " Gosea said. [PARAGRAPH]On the way up to the main processing room Cain saw that most of the cells were open and the prisoners had fled out into the city. Outside of one cell where the body of a prisoner lay dead on the floor. Cain guessed the excitement at his freedom had caused the man to try to take liberties with his beautiful rescuer. He hadn't even touched Gosea before she had killed him for it. [PARAGRAPH]They called for Mahon from the processing room and he ran up to meet them. Any prisoners that weren't released yet were left in their cells. Together the three fled up into the city. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 8[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stood floating above the high white walls of Bourne as dawn struck the great city. Once an angel had stood at each tower, divine guardians of this sacred city. The moniker Bourne the Gleaming was not due to the white walls, but the holy power that once permeated it. [PARAGRAPH]But that was centuries ago. In time, and across generations, the city had faded. The compact only allowed the gods, and their agents, to act when empowered by mortal faith. And there was little of that left in Bourne. [PARAGRAPH]As an angel of the god of revelation Verchiel stood silent witness to the triumphs and failures of the city, though there was little he could do to help, guide or protect its people. But each morning he prayed that it would get better, that through their faith he would be able to stand with them, that he could do more than watch them in pain. [PARAGRAPH]As Verchiel looked over the grey city the sun began to creep over its walls and light up the few citizens that had got an early start on the day. A baker plodded along the alleyway, yawning as he went. A young man rushed home, still swaying clumsily from the night before. [PARAGRAPH]From the heart of the city the cathedral bells rang and people headed to service. Born by the light streaming across the city Verchiel arched across the sky and as it struck the golden symbol of the Empyrean on the great Cathedral window Verchiel was there beside it. [PARAGRAPH]Inside parishioners talked in the muted tones of morning. Luminary Rimmon prepared himself for the morning service, thinking through the news of the attack and the way to calm the city before everyone learned about the prison breakin and the deaths of the guards. The Luminary was a decent man, more pragmatic than philosophical, more politician than priest. And though Verchiel had tried to go to him many times, the Luminary was unable to see or hear the angel. [PARAGRAPH]As the service started there was a flash of light from within the city, east of the cathedral. Not the light of fire or anything physical, but the outpouring of faith, of the true power of Lugus, the god of the Sun. [PARAGRAPH]It is hard to surprise an angel that has been with the world since the sun first shone upon it. But Verchiel was, for a long moment, stunned. Then, cautiously, he swept down from his perch on the cathedral and flew over the streets of Bourne. The people seemed unaware of the welling power, they opened their stands, brushed off their walks, or hurried to work as Verchiel swept over them. Until he found himself over a small plaza near the docs. Warehouses were on all sides, and this was typically used as a place for traders to meet and work out deals with the various ships docked nearby. But there were no new ships in yet today and the plaza was deserted. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel could feel the power here, it strengthened him and he noticed that, much like the city, he had faded as well. But the source of the power wasn't here in the plaza, it was under it. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel slipped down through the cobblestones and dirt and into the city sewers. He had rarely seen them before, it was rare that men of faith would have a reason to be in such dark corners. [PARAGRAPH]A symbol of the Empyrean was traced in gold on the smooth stone of the sewer platform. Light poured through it like a beacon and lit the chamber, sending light into places untouched by it for centuries. In the distance rats squeaked in frustration as they fled the area, and quieter predators slipped into the murky channels nearby and disappeared. [PARAGRAPH]On the other side of the sewer platform there was another rune, this one made of silver and inside it sat a woman with dark, empty eyes and skin that has never felt the touch of sunlight. [PARAGRAPH]She began talking while Verchiel looked around. She was looking right at him, though Verchiel couldn't hear her words. Behind her two men slept, seemingly unaware of what was happening, and she hadn't thought to protect them with the circle she used around herself. [PARAGRAPH]"Deceit and manipulation are as unknown to me as compassion to the fallen. " Verchiel said, "I cannot hear anything you say if it is not true. "[PARAGRAPH]As the woman considered, Verchiel looked within her. He was accustomed to some reaction from mortals that saw him, seeing the divine can make the corrupt repent, the simple pious, can make the devout transform. Even the most worldly had been awestruck by his presence. But this woman showed nothing. [PARAGRAPH]He saw within her a girl who didn't speak her first word until she was 8. She was raised in an asylum in Galveholm, and thought to be cursed or touched or simple. She spent years staring into the shadowed corners of her room and whispering to imagined things. Her eyes were the empty hopelessness of those who threw themselves off the high walls of Bourn, who cut themselves and watched with cold detachment as their life flowed out of them. The most remarkable thing about this woman was that she was here at all, Verchiel could see nothing within her that would motivate her to leave that small closet room at the asylum. A part of her may still remain there. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel was interrupted from his study as she spoke. [PARAGRAPH]"I want you to guide the people of this city to let us leave. If we have to fight our way out more people will die. " She said. [PARAGRAPH]"How did you consecrate this place?" Verchiel asked, ignoring her statement. [PARAGRAPH]"I didn't. " she said, "I opened a way to the Dies Diei, it is its light that you see, and feel, reflected here. "[PARAGRAPH]"And who are you?" Verchiel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I am Gosea the Dwindling, sorceress of Ceridwen. " She said. She said something after but it faded to nothing to Verchiel's ears, another lie. [PARAGRAPH]"Will you guide the city to let us leave?" Gosea asked. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel had heard of sorcerers trapping angels, but only in areas consecrated to the fallen. Bourne was no longer sacred, but he wondered if she thought it so weak that she could attack him, even beneath the city. [PARAGRAPH]"You are a husk, no different than the abomination you created from that poor dock worker. You are blind, afraid and alone. And you are dangerous. " Verchiel said. [PARAGRAPH]If his words had any effect on her, she didn't show it. "No," he continued, "I will guide them to stand against you and your queen. Faith opens our eyes, faith gives us courage and faith means that we are not alone. "[PARAGRAPH]With a thought Gosea extinguished the channel to Dies Diei. The light flickered out and the shadows rushed in to reclaim it. There was no attack from Gosea, she simply pulled her hood over her head and rested her chin on her palms while Verchiel slipped up through the top of the chamber and back into the daylight in the small plaza. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 9[PARAGRAPH]Gosea was still sitting in the runic circle when Mahon woke up. He stretched lazily and then stood up without bending his waist or using any momentum. He simply placed the soles of his feet on the floor and straightened his knees in denial of the fact that it should have been impossible to do so. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you commune with the dead?" Mahon asked, studying the circle. He had learned a little about sorcery while traveling with Gosea, but he didn't recognize any of the symbols she had carefully traced out. [PARAGRAPH]"No," she answered, "I spoke with an angel of Lugus, the one that sanctified this city. I was hoping we could skip this battle and get on to our task. "[PARAGRAPH]"I don't know much about angels. " Mahon said, "But I assume he didn't accept the offer. "[PARAGRAPH]"No. "[PARAGRAPH]"Should we be moving if he knows we are here? Can't he give someone a vision or commune with one of their sorcerers?" Mahon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I doubt there are any sorcerers talented enough to be able to see into the ether in Bourne. And holy men may be even rarer. The angel may be able to inspire those in his city, but they lack the faith to see or hear him, much as he might try. There are no miracles to be had in Bourne. "[PARAGRAPH]"I saw a miracle. " Cain said without moving. He was still on his bedroll, lying on his side and facing away from Gosea and Mahon. "The tower guard healed his companion, the one Mahon nearly decapitated. He prayed, and then it sounded like he was talking to someone. And his friend was healed. "[PARAGRAPH]"What was his name?" Gosea asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Mikel. " Cain said, "Captain Mikel Alaunus. "[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 10[PARAGRAPH]Just before dawn the next morning Mikel stood before the Cathedral of Bells. Ceth and Deirdre were with him. Deirdre was carrying Anna, who was slumped asleep on her mother's shoulder. [PARAGRAPH]All three were surprised to see that the cathedral was flooded with worshipers. And though it was the largest temple in the city, there were far too many people clamoring in front of the temple to get inside. [PARAGRAPH]"What's going on?" Deirdre asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know. " Mikel said, "Ceth, can you see if you can find Knight Commander Marlowe? I don't know if we are going to be able to find open seats for the service. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel and Deirdre waited outside and watched the crowd as Ceth tried to find Marlowe. At first Mikel wondered if the crowd may have gathered because of his vision. But these people seemed nervous and afraid. Judging by their clothing, many were from the docks. [PARAGRAPH]A few Literals came out of the temple and began to organize the crowd into smaller groups for prayers and sermons in the open square. Mikel was considering joining one when Ceth poked out of the cathedral and waved for Mikel and Deirdre to join him. [PARAGRAPH]"Marlowe has seats reserved for us. " Ceth said when they reached him. [PARAGRAPH]They followed Ceth into the cathedral. Compared to the small Fenestran temple the cathedral was a palace. A high arched foyer was decorated with candles and organ music from the nave could be heard echoing throughout. [PARAGRAPH]The nave was huge and shaped like an amphitheater, with two rows of balconies overlooking the main floor and a central stage where seven thrones faced a long, marble altar. Unlit candles wreathed the stage. Behind the stage a staircase seemed to ascend into a gold, topaz and amber sun design, but actually led to the cathedrals presbytery . [PARAGRAPH]"Luminary Rimmon would like to speak with you before the service. " Ceth said. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel followed Ceth up the cathedral's central aisle and onto the stage. Mikel felt the eyes of the crowded cathedral on their backs as they walked across the stage. It wasn't unusual to have guards in attendance, even in full uniform, but it was unusual to have them going to speak to the Luminary before the service. [PARAGRAPH]Knight Commander Marlowe was in the shallow preparation area behind the stage talking with Luminary Rimmon and a few Literals. Ceth and Mikel stood a respectful distance away until Marlowe waved them over. [PARAGRAPH]"Speaker Rimmon, allow me to introduce the soldiers I told you about. This is captain Mikel Alaunus and his lieutenant Ceth Kiln. " Marlowe said. [PARAGRAPH]"It is a pleasure to meet you captain. " Rimmon said, grasping Mikel's hand. Rimmon was a powerfully built man for a priest; he would be as comfortable on the battlefield as he was within the cathedral. His pale yellow robes and glittering necklace of sunstones contrasted with his short, practical hair and callous hands. [PARAGRAPH]"It is an honor. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"And you as well lieutenant Kiln. " Rimmon said, turning to Ceth. "Are those scars from the attack," He examined Ceth's neck, "and that were healed by the power of Lugus?"[PARAGRAPH]"Yes eyeman. I mean, yes Luminary. " Ceth said turning a bit red in the face. [PARAGRAPH]Rimmon smiled. "Eyeman is fine. You can even call me Rimmon if you want, though I have yet to meet a soldier that will do that. "[PARAGRAPH]After he was finished examining Ceth's scars Rimmon added, "And you captain Alaunus, you saw the angel?"[PARAGRAPH]"Yes Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"What did the angel look like?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"He appeared to be the angel from one of the stained glass windows in the Fenestran temple. Literal Edain identified him as Verchiel. He had skin like yellow glass with light shining through it. He appeared as a stained glass window come to life. " Mikel said. Mikel was sure that Rimmon had already heard the details of his vision, though it seemed he preferred to get an account directly from Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]"And what did he tell you?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"That there is a sickness within Bourne. That I can stop it if I have faith. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]Rimmon considered Mikel closely, much as he had investigated Ceth's scars. "Have you heard about the attack last night?"[PARAGRAPH]Mikel and Ceth exchanged concerned looks. [PARAGRAPH]"No Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"I'll let Marlowe fill you in on the details. " Rimmon said, "But the city is in a panic and I intend to use your vision to help bring calm. The people need to know that Lugus cares for us, that he is protecting us. Do you agree with that?"[PARAGRAPH]"Yes of course Luminary. " Mikel said, though he wasn't sure how he felt about his vision being used for propaganda. Or how protected the city really was if there had been an attack last night. [PARAGRAPH]After a pause Rimmon added, "Is there anything you left out of your story? Anything you would like to clarify? This is the time for brutal truth captain. "[PARAGRAPH]"No Luminary. " Mikel said, "I take the mandate of truth very seriously. It is exactly as I said. "[PARAGRAPH]"Very good captain. I don't mean to question your integrity, but before a sermon I have to make sure everything I say is true. I hope you understand. " Rimmon said. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]At that they were ushered to their seats. Marlowe had some set aside in the first balcony. There was even a seat reserved for Anna, though she preferred to sit on her mother's lap. [PARAGRAPH]"What was Luminary Rimmon like?" Deirdre whispered as they waited for the service to start. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know. " Mikel said, "He seemed worried about the city. "[PARAGRAPH]The touch of dawn light on the windows signaled the beginning of the service. Literal's funneled in from the foyer, each carrying a tall candle. As one they lit the candles around the stage, bringing the cathedral to light. [PARAGRAPH]Luminary Rimmon came up from the back of the stage with a large tome in his hands. He set the tome on a stand and then thanked the Literals, who bowed slightly and retreated to the edges of the room. [PARAGRAPH]"Another day has come, another promise has been kept. " Rimmon said. Then he paused, looking out at the assembled faces and down at his notes. Seeming to abandon his notes Rimmon spoke directly to the room. "We were attacked last night and eleven guardsmen were killed. In the docks some buildings caught fire and nearly three dozen prisoners escaped from the Drain. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel and Ceth looked first at each other and then at Marlowe, who returned their looks with a slight nod. They seemed to be the only ones in the room who didn't know about the attack. [PARAGRAPH]"Captain Cerron was one of the men killed. " Marlowe whispered. [PARAGRAPH]"Did Cain escape?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Marlowe nodded again. [PARAGRAPH]"It was a horrible night. " Rimmon continued. "But it is day now, and Lugus has not forgotten the people of Bourne. Many of you have heard rumors of a miracle on the north bridge, and I can tell you that it is true. An angel saved the life of a guard near death and delivered a message to one of our captains warning us of the coming danger. "[PARAGRAPH]There were audible gasps from the audience. [PARAGRAPH]"That captain is with us, Captain Mikel Alaunus. As well as the man the angel saved, Lieutenant Ceth Kiln. " Rimmon gestured toward where Mikel and Ceth sat on the balcony and everyone in the temple craned to see them. "Lieutenant Kiln still carries the scars from the attack but he has recovered. The city of Bourne is unchanged. "[PARAGRAPH]Rimmon continued with his sermon, comforting and encouraging the audience to stand firm, to carry a message of hope out to the city. But Mikel lost track of his words. The angel Verchiel was walking down the center aisle of the nave, and no one seemed to notice. [PARAGRAPH]The angel's wings were spread, and exactly as he had appeared before his skin seemed to glow like the sun through honey. In his left hand he held his familiar crescent shaped shield, but in his right he held a sword that burned with a perfect golden fire. [PARAGRAPH]The light from Verchiel was nearly blinding. It reflected from every surface in the cathedral and yet no one turned to look at him. When he walked between the people and where they sat looking at Rimmon they continued to look straight ahead. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stopped at the front of the aisle, directly in front of Rimmon. If anything Rimmon may have squinted his eyes in the light, but he continued his sermon and ignored the angel. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel looked at Dierdre and Ceth, but neither seemed to notice the angel. They both sat contentedly listening to Rimmon's sermon as the angel turned and walked to the edge of the room, where a single Literal stood watching the sermon. The Literal was an old woman, as old as Mikel had ever seen working at the church. She was thin, with grey hair and age spots on her wrinkled skin. Her face was etched with wisdom and sadness. And Mikel was sure she could see the angel. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stopped in front of the woman and spoke to her. Mikel couldn't hear the angel's words, but they sounded compassionate and kind. The woman's eyes filled with tears, then she looked away and hurried out of the cathedral. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel's light dimmed with her loss. Then with a great flap of his wings Verchiel took off into the open air of the cathedral and soared toward where Mikel was sitting in the balcony. He landed easily on the balcony rail, just in front of Dierdre, though she continued to stare through him at Rimmon just as the rest of the room was. [PARAGRAPH]"We are at the center of the sickness. I will show you that which blinds others. " Verchiel said. [PARAGRAPH]And with that the world changed to one painted in grays. Around him the ghost-like figures of the cathedral dreamed, whispered, cried or simply sat apart from the world around them. Though an angel, who retained his radiant orange and yellow colors, stood a few feet from them they didn't see him. [PARAGRAPH]"Why can't they see you?" Mikel whispered. [PARAGRAPH]"Fear, ambition, apathy. " Verchiel said, "In some cases even hope or love can bind them. Anything that can keep a man from fully trusting the divine. I have stood eternal guard over them and the city, and in too many cases I have been forced too only watch as they have suffered. I can touch upon the power of Lugus, but only as the faith of man allows. "[PARAGRAPH]"How can that faith be restored?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"We must pierce the darkness. " Verchiel and Luminary Rimmon both said at once. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel was momentarily confused by hearing the two voices together, but Rimmon continued with his sermon, unaware he had answered Mikel's question or had spoken in concert with an angel. [PARAGRAPH]"What can I do?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Tell your command to maintain the guards at the gates. Although they are dangerous, one of their number is injured. One of them could escape at any time by walking across the river. But the sorceress is weakened in this city, her strength will not return on this ground and she will not escape unless we allow it. "[PARAGRAPH]With that Verchiel was gone and the cathedral dropped back to the normal colors of the world, though to Mikel's eyes they seemed more drab after watching the angel. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel listened and prayed as Rimmon finished the sermon, offerings were accepted and the crowd seemed more generous on the eve of the tragedy, or more hopeful to buy some of Lugus's goodwill. [PARAGRAPH]After the closing prayer everyone rose and began funneling out of the cathedral. Mikel touched Deirdre's arm as she was about to leave. [PARAGRAPH]"Go home. " Mikel said. "I have to speak to Marlowe, I will be home soon. "[PARAGRAPH]"Come home with us. " Deirdre said, pulling at his shirt. "You have already done so much. "[PARAGRAPH]"I'll be home later. " Mikel said, then softening he kissed his wife and his daughter. "I will be okay. "[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre looked ready to argue but she let it go. She whispered something to him, but it was lost in the surrounding voices and then she was gone in the crowd heading out of the building. [PARAGRAPH]"Knight Commander," Mikel said, "may I speak with you and the Luminary Rimmon again?"[PARAGRAPH]Marlowe looked surprised, but he nodded and Marlowe, Mikel and Ceth worked their way against the crowd and down to the altar where Rimmon stood comforting a few of the parishioners that had approached him after the service. [PARAGRAPH]Intimidated by the arrival of the soldiers the parishioners said a quick goodbye and left Rimmon alone with them. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes Captain?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel became suddenly self-conscious, he looked around to see if he could see the angel, but Verchiel was gone. [PARAGRAPH]"The angel spoke to me again, during your service. " Mikel said. Ceth's eyes widened and Marlowe looked nervous. If Rimmon showed any emotion it was only a slight pursing of his lips. [PARAGRAPH]"And what did he say?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel relayed the story as he remembered it, from the vision of the gray cathedral full of parishioners wrapped in their own worries, to the warnings about watching the gates and continuing to look for Gosea and her companions. [PARAGRAPH]Rimmon listened to the whole story and considered his words carefully before asking, "Why do you think an angel would tell you to have us do something we are already doing?"[PARAGRAPH]"I don't know Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"Why do you think the angel delivers these messages to you instead of," Rimmon paused here, picking his words carefully, "more senior members of the temple?"[PARAGRAPH]"I don't know Luminary. " Mikel answered again. [PARAGRAPH]"Your vision and the people in this cathedral that couldn't hear the angel because of their more earthly concerns, did that apply to me as well?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel began to answer that he didn't know again. But he did know, and he again thought of his vows and the Mandate of Truth. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes Luminary, I believe it did. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel kept his eyes down on the floor, he didn't want to know what expression was on Rimmon's face. [PARAGRAPH]"Is there anything else captain?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"No Luminary. "[PARAGRAPH]With that Rimmon turned and walked back across the stage and into the presbytery. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 11[PARAGRAPH]It was a long walk back to Wyn Manor. Mikel had said goodbye to Ceth and Marlowe at the Cathedral of Bells and he kept his head down as he walked across the city. A few people called out to him as he passed, even some he didn't know and he half-heartedly returned their calls. [PARAGRAPH]He entered the Wyn manor kitchen as he had before, the kitchen smelled good and there was a fresh plate of bread and cheese sitting on the table. [PARAGRAPH]"Diery?" AnnaSophia called from upstairs. [PARAGRAPH]"No," Mikel called back, suddenly shaken out of his dark thoughts, "It's Mikel. Did Deirdre leave?"[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia came into the kitchen and her expression answered Mikel's question. Before she said anything he was back out the door and running toward the small house he shared with his wife and daughter. [PARAGRAPH]She wasn't supposed to go home alone, but maybe she forgot something. Maybe Anna wanted one of her toys. There is no chance that, out of all of the people of Bourne, Deirdre and Anna would run into Gosea. But somehow Mikel knew that was exactly what happened. Cain knew who he was. Everyone in the city was talking about them, it wouldn't have been hard to find out he had a wife and daughter. [PARAGRAPH]By the time he reached his house his world began falling apart one piece at a time. First the note pinned to the front door with a hairpin like Deirdre wore. He opened it with shaking hands. [PARAGRAPH][PARAGRAPH]Mikel,[PARAGRAPH]Order your men, claim a vision, do whatever you need to do to draw the guards away from the harbor gate tonight. If you do so, we will leave the city without incident. If you don't we will sacrifice your wife and your sweet daughter to Ceridwen, the breaker of men, and then kill many more on our way out of your dusty city. [PARAGRAPH]The choice is yours. Cain hopes you deny us, your wife reminds him of his own. [PARAGRAPH] - Gosea[PARAGRAPH][PARAGRAPH]Mikel was back at Wyn manor. He hadn't noticed the walk back, the city was a distant echo, a world apart from the prison of fear collapsing on him. AnnaSophia met him in the yard, and though she asked questions he couldn't understand them. He only held out the note as explanation. She read it and rushed him into the house. [PARAGRAPH]"Mikel, Deirdre needs you. Anna needs you. " AnnaSophia said, that at least echoed through to him. [PARAGRAPH]"I'm here. " Mikel replied, "I understand. " He tried to force the fear away. I need to get to the guard station, I need. . . to pray. "[PARAGRAPH]"No," AnnaSophia said, her voice perfectly calm, her eyes as focused and adamant as any knight commander. "You must do what they want. "[PARAGRAPH]"I cannot forsake Lugus. " Mikel said, "He will protect Deirdre and Anna, he will protect us if we remain faithful. As he did with Ceth. "[PARAGRAPH]"I have lost one faithful family member in Lugus's service already, I will not offer up my daughter and granddaughter!" AnnaSophia nearly screamed, her resolve falling apart like shattered glass. "Do you imagine that the faithful never fail, that they never suffer, that they never die? That I didn't once tell myself that Lugus would protect what I loved and bring him home safe? You can bring her home safe, you are the only one. "[PARAGRAPH]"Let me pray. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 12[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel knew Deirdre and Anna were being held in an abandoned workshop near the docks. He knew that Cain was watching them and that if the guards rushed the building they could save them before Cain could kill them. But there was a reason Gosea had taken Mikel's wife, she didn't know if she could control him, but she knew she could destroy him. And now Verchiel watched the small flicker of Mikel's faith, that gateway that allowed him to speak to Mikel, go out. [PARAGRAPH]Though Mikel prayed, though tears ran down his face and he desperately wanted to hear, and though Verchiel stood beside him in spirit, with tears streaming down his own face, that vast chasm of fear and doubt kept them apart. [PARAGRAPH]"Your desire to be faithful isn't enough. " Verchiel whispered. "You must give up your fear, you must place your faith in Lugus and I will make you a beacon that will drive away the night. "[PARAGRAPH]But Mikel couldn't hear him. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 13[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia hands only trembled a bit as she sipped her tea. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you get an answer?" she asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel stood up, still stunned as he had been ever since he saw the note, but he no longer had the delusion of a quick solution. [PARAGRAPH]"No, I saw the angel before, he talked to me, I don't know why he won't come now. "[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia didn't offer an answer. [PARAGRAPH]"I love my city, I love my religion and I love Lugus. " She said carefully. "But there is a limit to all things. Maybe I'm weak, but we can't sacrifice the people we love for our beliefs. It doesn't serve Lugus to let them die. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel picked up the note and headed out the manor's front door. [PARAGRAPH]"Are you going to save them?" AnnaSophia asked. [PARAGRAPH]He stopped in the doorway with his back to her. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know. " Mikel said, it was all he could offer before he headed out into the street. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 14[PARAGRAPH]Mikel met Commander Marlowe and Luminary Rimmon at the Cathedral of Bells. The vaulted ceilings of the cathedral had never seemed more empty, and though they stood close together and talked in hushed tones in the empty cathedral, their voices echoed back them in conspiratorial whispers. [PARAGRAPH]"I know what they are going to try to do. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]Marlowe hadn't questioned Mikel's request to meet at the temple with Rimmon. Both men could see the concern and panic on Mikel's face and in his voice. Though they waited, Mikel didn't say anything. [PARAGRAPH]"Is Deirdre okay?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel's head fell into his hands. "No Luminary, she's not. They took her and Anna. I don't know where they are. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel explained the note and the threat as they listened. [PARAGRAPH]"Maybe we are best to let them flee the city, and we will have the best chance to save Mikel's wife and daughter. Commander do you really think you could stop them if they wanted to fight their way out? The witch's power is considerable. " Rimmon said. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know Luminary. " Marlowe answered. "But they have killed my men, our brothers, I still have families to meet with. Though more may die, I cannot simply let them go unavenged. "[PARAGRAPH]"What are your thought's Captain? Am I to assume that you wish to fight the battle since you declined their offer to mislead us?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I am bound by the Mandate of Truth. " Mikel said, "And I remain devote to the sun, even during deepest night. What if we pretend to abandon the gate?"[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 15[PARAGRAPH]Mahon slipped in the small home through a panel in the roof, falling to the floor with the grace of a dancer stepping from one step to another. [PARAGRAPH]"Did they clear the gate?" Gosea asked. [PARAGRAPH]"They are pretending to. Soldiers are disguised as commoners, some are hidden in the gatehouse. The chains inside the gate hang unlocked, but they have attached another set on the other side of the gate. "[PARAGRAPH]"What needless sacrifice. " Gosea said, mostly to herself. "Cain, kill the mother and child. "[PARAGRAPH]"Does it matter?" Cain asked, and though Gosea's dark eyes didn't reflect any irritation at his question, she did study him closely. [PARAGRAPH]"I assumed we would kill them either way. " Mahon said as he settled on the couch. [PARAGRAPH]"It's a spiritual game we play. " Gosea answered. "If the captain would have betrayed his city and god, then I have no need for his family, he is broken. But if he has chosen to trust his faith, then I cannot allow that fire to burn at our back. I cannot have his faith rewarded or we risk a new enemy for Galveholm. "[PARAGRAPH]"If we kill his family, he will be an enemy of Galveholm. " Cain said. [PARAGRAPH]"A man of faith can do more than an army of soldiers. He is useless broken. Kill his family. "[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 16[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel dropped to his knees and cried. He was an angel of Lugus, lord of the dawn and revelation, but he was unable to deliver his message. He knew where Mikel's wife and daughter were imprisoned, Verchiel was kneeling beside them in the ether. But Mikel was too full of fear and doubt to hear the angel's voice. Even now the witch and her guards were in the small homes common room planning to kill their prisoners. Deirdre and Anna had only a few minutes left to live. [PARAGRAPH]"Why are you crying?"[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stopped in surprise. He looked up to see see the innocent face of Anna looking at him quizzically. [PARAGRAPH]"Can you see me child?" Verchiel asked, equally puzzled. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course. " she said, "What is your name?"[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre sat staring at the iron bound door of the cell as she had since she was taken. The room was an old cellar and still had a pile of old tools and supplies in it. She had been through it a dozen times but there was nothing that could help her escape. She tried to stay strong and save her tears for when her daughter wasn't watching. She was so lost in her thoughts it took her a minute to realize Anna was holding a conversation with an old broom. [PARAGRAPH]"Chipmunk, who are you talking to?" Deirdre asked. [PARAGRAPH]Anna smiled, "His name is Verchiel, he's an angel and he will help us get back to daddy. "[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre had no words. At three years old her daughter had gone crazy. Deirdre wasn't sure if she should be jealous of her daughters hope, or condemn her for it. [PARAGRAPH]"We need something shiny" Anna said, going through the pile of supplies. She finally found an old copper plate that seemed to satisfy her and she started cleaning it with the hem of her dress. [PARAGRAPH]Deirdre heard the door to the cellar open. It was barely an hour since they had been fed and an unexpected visit from their kidnappers couldn't be good. Deirdre pulled Anna into her arms and when she squirmed Deirdre told her to be quiet. [PARAGRAPH]There was a jingle of keys and the cellar door opened. Cain, the largest of the kidnappers, opened the door. He had his axe drawn. [PARAGRAPH]"Sorry" he said with some sympathy, "your husband's too stubborn for his own good. "[PARAGRAPH]At that Anna tore free of her mother's grip and stood protectively in front of her. She held the polished copper plate above her head and Cain stepped back slightly at the sudden move. Nothing happened. [PARAGRAPH]Then Anna asked the broom, "What do I say?"[PARAGRAPH]"Come on. " Cain said. "There's no joy in killing a child. But you won't be my first. "[PARAGRAPH]"You cannot hide your actions" Anna shouted in a voice half her own and half unworldly, "Lugus will reveal all. If you mean to escape, then flee now into the darkness; this area has been claimed by the rose of summer!"[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre was stunned. But Cain wasn't about to be cowed by a three year with an old plate, and he stepped towards Anna. [PARAGRAPH]The copper plate exploded in light. It was as if Anna held the sun above her head. Cain covered his eyes in pain as light flooded the cellar, the small stairway and up in-to the home. Inside the house it rushed over Mahon and Gosea and broke free of every window or crack in the home's walls and spilled out onto the dark streets of Bourne and through the patchwork roof up into the night sky. [PARAGRAPH]Everyone in Bourne who had ever whispered a silent prayer to Lugus felt the stirring of holy power. The guards hidden at the harbor gate threw off their disguises and rushed to the home, as did the nearby watch and the local eyemen. [PARAGRAPH]Cain tried to stand against the waves of blinding light even though it burnt through to his closed and shielded eyes. He placed his axe in front of him and risked one peek at where he thought Anna was standing. When he looked he saw a golden angel standing before him with a blazing sword. [PARAGRAPH]"My arda is upon these two, you will not harm them. " the angel said. [PARAGRAPH]Cain raised his axe and pressed forward, but he was engulfed in light. Every darkness within him was undone, every cruel, pained memory swallowed like shadows chased out of a brightly lit room. Cain slumped back against the wall, his arms fell to his side and he dropped the axe on the floor. There were no memories left, and he stared up into the light with the innocence of a child. [PARAGRAPH]"It's okay. " Anna said as she stepped forward and took his large calloused hand in hers. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 17[PARAGRAPH]As the light exploded out of the small house's cellar Mahon and Gosea both fled out into the street. [PARAGRAPH]"Take the Heartstone. " Gosea said, pushing the delicately wrapped package into Mahon's hands. "Get it to Tebryn, get out of this city. "[PARAGRAPH]"I won't leave you alone. " Mahon argued. [PARAGRAPH]City guards carrying lanterns were already flooding onto the street, the site of the house still bursting with light caused them to pause briefly, but they would see Ma-hon and Gosea soon. [PARAGRAPH]"I am never alone. " Gosea said. "Get over the wall, now!"[PARAGRAPH]Mahon turned to look at the nearly 40 foot tall stone wall, "I'm going to need some help. " he said to himself. [PARAGRAPH]Gosea turned toward the guards and was careful to stay away from any of the beams of light streaming out of the house. [PARAGRAPH]"Sino, Vulnero, Dolor, Carcer, Ictus. . . " and on Gosea went, naming the myriad of spirits bound into her rings, runes and tattoos. At each name a spirit flew from her, a few, then dozens as her calls blurred together and became as wild and powerful as a storm at sea. Each spirit followed her command and jumped into the lanterns the guards carried, possessing the fire, gathering the oil about them and then leaping out onto the guards or the surrounding buildings. [PARAGRAPH]Guards screamed and rolled on the ground, but these flames couldn't simply be doused, they would leap off the guards and leap back. Guards tried patting each other down, or throwing their cloaks on each other, but it only caused confusion and the flames continued to dance among them. [PARAGRAPH]"Obey me" Gosea shouted as she flung her hands up over her head, away from the guards and toward the wall. As one, all of the flames streaked through the night air like dragonfire and struck the wall, sending oil straying in all directions, creating a pillar of thick, black smoke. But the wall had survived sieges, outside of some char marks it was unaffected. [PARAGRAPH]Commander Marlowe and Mikel reached the street in time to see the scattered guards still trying to understand what had happened. Marlowe immediately began shouting orders for the men to form up and prepare to rush the house, a squad was ordered to start triaging buckets of water and the injured were pulled back behind the lines. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel saw Gosea and Mahon standing silhouetted by the fire burning against the city wall. [PARAGRAPH]"Wait, Mikel. " Marlowe yelled, "They aren't going anywhere, they are trapped. "[PARAGRAPH]"No, they're not. " Mikel yelled back as he drew his sword and charged toward them. [PARAGRAPH]"Go!" Gosea shouted to Mahon. Spurred on by her words he sprinted toward the burning wall. Gosea turned to face Mikel, and her face was as pale and impassive as the moon. Even shadowed by the burning wall behind her Mikel could still see those immutable dark eyes. [PARAGRAPH]"Surrender!" Mikel shouted. [PARAGRAPH]Gosea didn't reply. Meaning to push quickly by her, Mikel dipped down, sweeping his sword low, below her arm and towards her thigh for a cut that would be painful, but not lethal. [PARAGRAPH]At the last moment Gosea moved toward Mikel, stabbing at him from a thin dagger in a hand that had appeared empty. The dagger went right through Mikel's arm, catching itself between the twin bones of the forearm and digging all the way through until its point poked out of the other side of his arm. This stopped his swing and she used his momentum, and her leverage to spin him around. [PARAGRAPH]Blinded by pain Mikel slammed the metal gloved fist of his other hand into Gosea's face. The witch's head snapped back, her nose shattered and her facial features swam as bones broke and gave way under the force. She let go of her knife and collapsed backwards onto the street. [PARAGRAPH]Nearly choking on blood Gosea spoke one more name, "Peractio. "[PARAGRAPH]A winged serpent the size of a man burst painfully up out of Gosea. Flowing from every part of her it filled her mouth, her nose, her ears and though she tried to scream, the serpent kept her from doing so. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel pulled the dagger out of his arm and switched his sword to the other hand just in time to block the serpent's first attack. Though his sword cut right across the serpent's body, the steel did not injure the demonic creature. [PARAGRAPH]The serpent lunged again and Mikel was forced to back up against the house. In the distance he could see Gosea struggling to get back up on her feet and the end of Mahon's sprint toward the burning wall. Instead of being stopped by the wall Mahon jumped up and stepped on the billowing smoke, riding it up and continuing to jump from black, ashy plume to plume to the top of the wall. [PARAGRAPH]With his back to the small house Mikel ducked another attack by the serpent and brought his sword up in a wide arch, an attack the serpent easily avoided as his sword plunged into one of the house's closed shutters. With his weapon trapped the serpent hissed, his eyes were cold, black and empty and for a brief second Mikel was lost in the utter lack of passion or rage in them. [PARAGRAPH]Then Mikel ripped the shutter off of the window and the serpent was bathed in the streaming white light bursting out of the house. The creature howled the sound of wind rushing down an endless pit and broke apart like oil consumed by fire. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 18[PARAGRAPH]Gosea was quickly apprehended. The enigmatic witch was gone, replaced by a scared young woman who cursed the guards, the city and Lugus loudly and with great fervor. Though riders were sent from the gate to chase down Mahon, he wasn't found. [PARAGRAPH]But it was Marlowe's voice that drew Mikel's attention. The soldiers had charged into the house, whose light was beginning to dim, and the commander's voice thundered above the burning fire, the screaming witch, and the growing amount of soldiers rushing into the square. It was a call of something more important than battle and demons and Mikel rushed to get to him. [PARAGRAPH]The soldiers parted as Mikel rushed into the house where his wife and daughter stood smiling and uninjured. Mikel swept them both up into his arms. It was hours before he let go of either of them. [PARAGRAPH]</German>
		<Italian>Gosea can channel spirits, usually demons, but has no ability to control them. Instead they possess her and use her as a puppet. She has power, but no will, and she is helpless to be anything but a victim to the forces that control her. [PARAGRAPH:4]Fideism[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 1[PARAGRAPH]Stained glass windows decorated the walls of the Fenestran temple. The windows were so large the walls seemed more glass than stone. The windows on the east favored yellow while those on the west side of the temple favored orange which caused the airy temple to change hue throughout the day. [PARAGRAPH]The temples dome was topped by a plain round window so at noon, as it was now, it was at its brightest. The light reflected off the temples polished bronze columns, leaving few shadows in the large room. The rooms focus was at its center where a pillar of light fell on a priest wearing pale yellow robes and the man that knelt before him. A small group of friends and family dotted the first few pews of the temple, a modest but proud turnout. [PARAGRAPH]"In duty and honor I consecrate this man to you dear Lugus, rose of summer. So that his life and spirit may be yours, to use and guide as you see fit. Bless him and keep him in your care as he remains vigilant to your will and that of the church. "[PARAGRAPH]"Arise Mikel Alaunus, new man of Bourne. " the priest continued. "As a humble servant of Lugus and this city I consecrate you as captain Alaunus, champion of the dawn, holy knight in the army of Bourne the Gleaming. Arise and accept the mandate of truth, throw your secrets away and join the revealing light of Lugus. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel stood. He was nearly a head taller than the young priest and his broad shoulders were evident even beneath the loose ceremonial tunic. His skin was the color of copper, as compared to the milky cast of the others in the room, and where his tunic fell low on his neck the black swirl of a tattoo could be seen. Mikel wasn't afraid of the mandate of truth, but public speaking, even to this small crowd, made him nervous. [PARAGRAPH]"I grew up in an orphanage in Galveholm, capital of the Sheaim empire. " Mikel began. "The orphanage wasn't like those here in Bourne. It wasn't a place to raise children, it was a place to store them. Galveholm is a brutal, violent city, full of promise and power for those willing to take it, and little protection for anyone else. "[PARAGRAPH]"I killed a man, a boy really, when I was twelve. His name was Augess and though he was only a year younger, he was small for his age. I struck out of habit more than any real malice, but he was angry at the way we treated him. He attacked me. He was in a rage, but still too weak to hurt me. I became angry too, and I killed him in the orphanage stairwell surrounded by the cruel cheers of the other boys. "[PARAGRAPH]"By the time I was fifteen I had killed two more. I was a murderer, an extortionist, a thief and a liar. My skill with a sword made me useful to cruel men. But when the man I worked for was assassinated, when others who worked for him began to die, I fled. "[PARAGRAPH]"I worked on caravans and ships before ending up in Bourne. I knew as soon as I saw this city I wanted to stay here. The cities high white walls, the battlements that seemed to be topped with gold and the cathedrals that dotted the city's skyline were all so different from the twisted towers and dark alleys of Galveholm. "[PARAGRAPH]"I was nearly arrested when I tried to enter the city. I am Sheaimic by birth and my tattoos are not only evidence of my past, but illegal in Bourne. After speaking with Gate Captain Marlowe he agreed to allow me my freedom if I worked on a local farm and stayed out of the city. I did so, working for Ferris Tawns, for just over three years. "[PARAGRAPH]"Ferris was a wonderful boss, and the years spent on his farm were my happiest to that point in my life. "[PARAGRAPH]Ferris and his wife, who were sitting near the back of the small group, didn't display any emotion at the praise. This wasn't simple appreciation, but a religious ceremony and everyone understood that regardless of what was revealed, the mandate of truth wasn't about those in the story, it was about the speaker. [PARAGRAPH]"I am ashamed to say I stole from Ferris while I worked from him. Though he shared his table with me, and paid me well I stole small things I could sell to traders on the road. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel was relieved to notice Ferris and his wife remained stoic. That was harder for him to admit than the murders. Failing after changing his life seemed like a bigger loss than the things he had done before. [PARAGRAPH]"Gate Captain Marlowe kept in touch with me and made sure his mercy was well placed. He eventually allowed me to travel with Ferris to the city's market to sell produce, and I enjoyed those trips. I befriended the market guards and when they were looking for new recruits, with Ferris and Marlowe's blessing, I applied. "[PARAGRAPH]"I have been working in the market for the past seven years. It was where I met my wife Deirdre, who I love deeply. We have been married for five years and four years ago we had a daughter, Anna. "[PARAGRAPH]Anna was unable to maintain the stoic expression and beamed at the mention of her name. Though Deirdre looked outwardly passive and listening, Mikel knew she was nearly as nervous as he was. The mandate of truth caused a lot of new knights to reveal past infidelities and crimes that sometimes destroyed families. Mikel was delighted he had no transgressions against his marriage, wife or daughter to admit. [PARAGRAPH]"Shortly after Anna's birth I began to feel drawn to the cities temples. Deirdre's father had been a knight commander in the church and gave his life in service to Lugus. My friend and fellow guardsman Ceth spent many shifts talking about his faith and the Empyrean . In time I began attending dawn rituals with him and my family. "[PARAGRAPH]"Three weeks ago I was offered the opportunity to become a knight in the service of Lugus and lead my own guard unit on the north bridge. I am undeserving of this honor, but I will give my devotion, my life, and my eternal soul, to the service of Lugus and to this city. "[PARAGRAPH]At this Mikel knelt again. [PARAGRAPH]The priest rubbed his thumb in a small pot on his belt, scooping out honey colored oil which he rubbed on Mikel's closed eyes. [PARAGRAPH]"Remember you carry the mandate of truth with you always. " the priest intoned. "Open your eyes to a world without deception, live your life revealed and without fear. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel opened his eyes. The oil burned and through the amber haze the bright temple appeared even brighter. Mikel could hear the people in the pews standing up and talking to each other, friends congratulating his wife. But he could only see a dizzying dance of light. The stained glass windows, once beautiful but lifeless, now glowed with an inner fire that made them seem alive. Angels and saints of the Empyrean looked down at him in full radiant glory. And one, an angel with a crescent shaped shield and a hand lost to golden light, seemed to float apart from the window. The angel looked down at Mikel with a look of passive benevolence. The angel reached out its burning hand, as if to touch Mikel on the forehead. But the light was too bright and although Mikel's eyes teared up as he tried to watch the vision, he was forced to blink and the room returned to normal. The angel was once again just a figure in the window. [PARAGRAPH]With one last look at the window Mikel turned back to the priest. [PARAGRAPH]"Thank you Literal Edain," Mikel said to the priest, "It is an honor I will give my life to uphold. "[PARAGRAPH]The priest smiled, but said nothing. [PARAGRAPH]"Is any sort of donation customary?" Mikel added quietly, embarrassed he was unaware of the protocol. [PARAGRAPH]"No my son," the priest said patting Mikel's hand. "You do a great service for our god. It is I who should be thanking you. Go and enjoy the day and your family. Though I expect to see you for morning devotions. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course eyeman . "[PARAGRAPH]The rest of the small group joined in congratulating Mikel. But Mikel found himself glancing back at the window that showed the angel with the crescent shield. After a few minutes Mikel was able to break away and ask the priest about it. [PARAGRAPH]"Literal Edain, who is the angel in the third eastern window?" Mikel asked. "The one with the crescent shield?"[PARAGRAPH]The priest stopped putting away the objects from the ceremony and looked at the window as if trying to remember. [PARAGRAPH]"I believe his name is Verchiel. Nearly sixty years ago, soon after this temple was first built, an occisor chased two children in here. A nine year old girl named Amelie and her brother, who was a few years younger. Amelie fell at the foot of the altar and prayed for help while her brother tried to fight the occisor. The boy was killed, but when the occisor went for Amelie, Verchiel protected her. The occisor fled from the temple and Amelie devoted her life to the Empyrean. "[PARAGRAPH]After a pause the priest added, "Why do you ask?"[PARAGRAPH]"The oil. . . " Mikel said clumsily, "I mean, I thought I saw that angel move during the ceremony. "[PARAGRAPH]"That is good. " Edain said, though Mikel couldn't tell if he was being patronizing or if visions like his were so common that the priest was unimpressed by it. Edain patted Mikel's arm and without saying more went back to storing the altar cloth in the small recess behind the altar. [PARAGRAPH]Deirdre approached the altar still beaming with pride at her husband. Anna followed her mother, anxious to hug her father but unsure if she was allowed to come close yet. Anna beamed up at Mikel with a smile identical to her mother's as he scooped her up in his arms. [PARAGRAPH]"My mother has a carriage ready, I think she is almost as proud of you as I am. " Deirdre whispered as she hugged Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 2[PARAGRAPH]At dawn the next morning Mikel was back at the temple. It was nearly full as the crowd went through morning devotions, alternatively sitting in quiet reflection, open prayer, and listening to Literal Edain speak. This morning Edain talked about Bridgit, the archangel of Bhall, who remained true to her goddess's mandate of divine passion even as Bhall fell to the whispers of Agares. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth sat on one side of Mikel, and Deirdre on the other. Anna sat on her mother's lap dutifully listening to the sermon, her eyes wide with wonder. She had blue ribbons in her blond hair, and in the yellow light of the temple her hair seemed to be made of gold. [PARAGRAPH]With a whispered blessing Literal Edain dismissed the congregation and almost as one the crowd rose to leave. Mikel interrupted the group funneling out to give his wife and daughter a quick kiss. [PARAGRAPH]"I will see you tonight. " Mikel whispered. Then to Ceth he added, "Can you wait for me? I want to speak to the eyeman. "[PARAGRAPH]Ceth nodded and stepped outside to get out of the way of those leaving behind him. After a hug Deirdre and her mother took Anna out into the city, already talking about their plans for the day. Mikel waited until the temple was clear before he approached Edain. [PARAGRAPH]"Eyeman, do you have a minute?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course. " Edain said sitting in the first pew and signaling Mikel to sit beside him. "What is it?"[PARAGRAPH]"It's about the mandate of truth. I have a question about when it is appropriate. "[PARAGRAPH]Edain sat passively, giving no indication if these sorts of questions were expected or unusual after someone has been through the ceremony. [PARAGRAPH]"I am a part of a lie, but it is not my secret. " Mikel said, "My mother-in-law believes I met Dierdre while working as a guard in the market, that I saved her from a thief. The truth is, we met when I caught Deirdre stealing from one of the merchants. "[PARAGRAPH]Again there was no indication if this surprised Edain or not. [PARAGRAPH]"I want to be honest with my mother-in-law, but I don't want to violate my wife's trust. What does the mandate of truth require of me? What does Lugus ask?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Edain offered a practiced smile. "The mandate of truth is a heavy burden. One that cannot be forced on any man, and must be accepted willingly. You cannot force your wife to live under its restrictions just because you do. To do so is to invite secrets between you, and the purpose of the mandate of truth is to live without secrets. "[PARAGRAPH]Edain paused before continuing. "But, you should encourage your wife to be honest in all things. This lie does not protect her, it traps her. One cannot change the past simply by saying it is not so. Speaking personally I have known AnnaSophia for many years, and I have no doubt she will have compassion for her daughter if she is told the truth. "[PARAGRAPH]"Yes eyeman. " Mikel said, "You are right. Thank you. "[PARAGRAPH]After another thanks Mikel headed out of the temple, where Ceth waited for him. They were a few blocks from the north bridge and the walk was a good way to warm up on the cold morning. [PARAGRAPH]The north bridge was unguarded during the winter. The few that crossed it were local farmers and traders, and even they were infrequent. But once the northern passes opened, activity would increase until it became one of the busiest bridges in Bourne. [PARAGRAPH]When it was built the bridge was wide enough that one of the aspen trees that grew along the rivers northern bank could have been laid across it. But since that time merchants had setup stalls on both sides of the bridge and there was barely room left for two caravans to pass. [PARAGRAPH]When Mikel and Ceth arrived the gates at both ends of the bridge were closed. Mikel unlocked each and turned to look at the empty stalls and the bridge tower. A deer stood in the woods at the north end of the bridge watching the two men. [PARAGRAPH]"Are we supposed to protect the city from the deer?" Ceth asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Laugh now, in a few weeks you will have more than enough work. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"By work you mean sitting by the tower watching caravans roll by, right?" Ceth said. [PARAGRAPH]"Right, and the occasional patrol up and down the bridge. But don't worry, we have some real work today. " Mikel said unlocking the bridge tower and opening it to stuffy room with a small jail, desk and armory. A nest of webs filled the corners of the room and the dried husks of rats hung in the webbing. [PARAGRAPH]"Today we clean. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"Then who is going to keep an eye on the deer?" Ceth said disgusted. [PARAGRAPH]The spider was nearly the size of a man's head, and both the men were glad there was no one else on the bridge to hear their screams as they chased and eventually killed it. They spent the rest of the day cleaning the tower. They accepted a small shipment of weapons and armor, stored them in the armory and then sat outside the tower and watched the river and the leafless woods beyond for the rest of the afternoon. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 3[PARAGRAPH]Just as Mikel promised, within a few weeks the bridge was alive with activity. All of the stalls were open with merchants hawking their wares to passing caravans, and it was rare to have a moment without at least one caravan on the bridge. The woods on the north bank were now green, the days were warmer and Mikel had ten guards, including his lieutenant Ceth, assigned to the north bridge and reporting to him. [PARAGRAPH]"Come down off my wagons!"[PARAGRAPH]The scream was angry, though it was easily lost in the chaos of people arguing over the price of goods, yelling for people to move out of the way of wagons and the sounds of various mules, oxen and chickens scattered over the bridge. [PARAGRAPH]"Guardsman!" an angry merchant yelled, looking at Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]"Captain," Mikel corrected, "and what can I do for you?"[PARAGRAPH]"There is a man, a thief, rooting through my goods. " the merchant exclaimed. He was a large man and his face was bright red with anger. He looked to be about to climb up onto the wagon where a wiry man poked beneath the tarps that covered it, if he could manage to lift his bulk up off the road, which didn't seem likely. [PARAGRAPH]"Greylin," Mikel called, "get off the wagon. I've warned you about this before. "[PARAGRAPH]"Mikel, tell him I'm no thief. I'm just checking to see what he has for sale. " Then turning to the red faced merchant Greylin added, "How much do you want for these radishes? I could take the whole batch off your hands. "[PARAGRAPH]Cutting off the merchant before he started to scream again, Mikel said "Now Greylin, or it's a night in the cell. "[PARAGRAPH]With a look of disappointment Greylin climbed down. "The real thieves are in the market, they won't pay anything for these goods. They don't offer fair deals to outsiders. Not like me, I respect a man who traveled all the way to Bourne. You don't have to be my cousin's sister's whatever to get a fair deal from me. "[PARAGRAPH]"Greylin is harmless. " Mikel said to the merchant whose face was returning to a normal color, "And he isn't a thief, though he is overeager. You won't have any more problems with him. " Mikel said this last point loud enough that Greylin could hear him. [PARAGRAPH]After making sure the merchant wasn't going to attack Greylin, Mikel headed back and sat down outside the guard tower beside Ceth. The two rarely had a chance to work together since Ceth was the bridge lieutenant and in charge of the bridge during shifts Mikel wasn't working. [PARAGRAPH]"Is it any better at night?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"It's not this crowded. But it's steady until dusk, then we get a rush of activity as people try to get into or out of the city. We never get the gates closed on time. " then Ceth added, "I was going to ask Donovan if he could work tonight. Fenton is sick, covered with boils if his wife is to be believed, and I'm down a man. "[PARAGRAPH]"Donovan is sick too, sounds like he may have the same thing. We only have three men on the bridge today. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"Think they may be all off drinking somewhere?" Ceth said half-joking. [PARAGRAPH]"I saw Donovan. " Mikel said, "He looked horrible. A bunch of people in the city have been getting sick, most get better in a few days. I can cover for Fenton, maybe I can talk Deirdre into bringing us some dinner. "[PARAGRAPH]"Are you sure? I can ask someone else. " Ceth said. [PARAGRAPH]"It's no problem, but you have to pay me back by sticking around and covering Donovan's shift for the rest of the day. "[PARAGRAPH]The rest of the day went smoothly. Just as Ceth described there was a rush of activity just before the gates closed and by the time the dusk bells rang throughout Bourne the gates were all still open. Finally a little more than an hour later they were closed and locked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel locked the guard tower and met Ceth for a final walk down to check in with the overnight guards on the north side of the bridge. Walking down they were surprised to see three figures walking toward them. It was too dark to see clearly but it looked to be a woman flanked by two men. One of the men was a bear of a man, thick through the chest and shoulders. He plodded forward with all the grace of a boulder rolling down hill. The other man was the opposite, he was almost lost in the silhouette of his cloak. A slight turn and this man stepped into the shadows of one of the merchant stalls and disappeared. [PARAGRAPH]"Halt. " Ceth called lifting his spear. The two figures they could still see continued walking forward as if they hadn't heard him. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel's hand went instinctively to his sword hilt. Something about these people worried him. The gate guards wouldn't allow anyone on the bridge after closing. And the way one of the companions disappeared spoke to a skill beyond simple travelers. Mikel hadn't even drawn his sword other than to care for it since being assigned to the bridge. He had used his sap a few times and sometimes threatened to use a short cudgel he carried. But this was the first time he was tempted to draw his sword. A blue ribbon tied around the swords hilt reminded him to stay calm. [PARAGRAPH]"Careful," Mikel whispered to Ceth, "there were three of them. "[PARAGRAPH]They were now close enough to see each other. The woman was the most notable, with pale alabaster skin that made her look almost ghostlike in the moonlight. She wore burgundy robes so dark Mikel first mistook them for black, her hair was long and black and her eyes were dark pools. She was beautiful, as long as you avoided her eyes, which were cold and empty. [PARAGRAPH]Her bearlike companion wore a horsehair cloak and worn leather armor. He held a thick double bladed axe casually in his hand, it dripped with a dark liquid. Mikel could see the swirl of black tatoo's sticking out from beneath his leather bracers. [PARAGRAPH]"Sheaim!" Mikel yelled, hand going to his sword. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth lowered his spear, pointing it threateningly at the woman as he stepped towards her. She ignored him, throwing her head back as if to howl. But instead of making any noise Mikel felt a sudden pressure on his ears and head that was so strong it made him dizzy. Not only did the woman make no noise, everything went perfectly silent. The sound of the wind blowing across the tarps over merchant stalls disappeared, the sounds of the river lapping against the bridges foundations was gone, only perfect empty silence remained. [PARAGRAPH]It was silent as the man with the double bladed axe walked towards Mikel. Silent as Ceth approached the woman. Ceth shook his head and looked at Mikel in confusion, whatever was affecting Mikel was affecting him as well. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel drew his sword in time to parry the axeman's attack. He could now see that the liquid on the axe was fresh blood, and he had little doubt it was from the overnight guards. This axeman could have been any of the kids that grew up in the orphanage with him. He had the same copper colored skin, and the same delight on his face at the opportunity to cause pain. [PARAGRAPH]But Mikel was not a simple guardsman grown soft settling disputes between merchants. With force the axeman wasn't expecting Mikel parried the axe and brought an armored elbow up hard against the side of the axeman's face. Suddenly the look of delight was gone, replaced by anger. [PARAGRAPH]The cloaked man that had slipped into the shadows came out. He stepped between Ceth and the woman, and when Ceth lunged with his spear he leapt up and landed easily on the end of Ceth's spear. [PARAGRAPH]There he stood, almost frozen, an axe in each hand and seemingly without affecting the weight of spear at all. Ceth stood unbelieving. First the silence and now this man stood on the tip of his spear as if balancing on a tightrope. The scene had an eerie dreamlike quality. [PARAGRAPH]Meanwhile the axeman Mikel was fighting continued to swing wildly. Mikel drew his cudgel in his left hand and it was quickly destroyed by the powerful axe. Another parry and an elbow to the axeman's face sent the axeman stumbling backwards, cursing soundlessly. Mikel didn't waste the opportunity and stabbed the axeman's exposed side, just below his kidney and through until stopped by the leather plate on the axeman's back. The axeman stumbled back further and fell, a dark pool quickly welled around the wound. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth tried to shake his spear, to knock off the man standing on it. But instead the man ran up the length of the spear. Coming up nearly to Ceth's hand the attacker swung his twin axes, catching Ceth's throat and sending a bright red arch of blood high into the air, some even struck Mikel, though he was over three meters away. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth went back, head down hard into the stone bridge. He dropped the spear and the man nimbly landed on the ground, turning toward Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]The woman stopped her silent howl and sound returned with another dizzying pop of pressure. [PARAGRAPH]"Leave him, run. " the woman said pointing toward the south end of the bridge. Together the two started running toward the city. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel fell at Ceth's side, ignoring the fleeing attackers and the axeman lying wounded on the bridge. Ceth's eyes were spinning wildly in fear and confusion, but they stopped when they locked onto Mikel's. He tried to speak but that only caused more blood to spill out of his open throat. Mikel clasped both hands over Ceth's throat, trying in vain to stop the bleeding, though blood continued to pour through his fingers. [PARAGRAPH]"Please, please, please. " Mikel whispered, trying to contain the horror rushing through him. A deep breath and his thoughts focused, his fear was gone. [PARAGRAPH]"Please, Lugus, lord of the dawn, do not forget us. " Mikel whispered, "Do not let him die. He has seen too few days. Share your mercy and your light with him. "[PARAGRAPH]There was a sudden heat through Mikel's fingers and he felt Ceth gasp. Opening his eyes Mikel saw Verchiel, the angel in the temple, kneeling on the other side of Ceth, mirroring Mikel's pose. Verchiel was praying too, and where the angel's hands passed through Mikel's he felt heat and power. [PARAGRAPH]Any shock or surprise was gone in this moment. Mikel only cared about saving Ceth and did not question the appearance of the glowing angel. Verchiel appeared much like a stained glass window, his skin was golden and slightly translucent and an inner light seemed to radiate from him. He wore modest white robes trimmed in yellow and he had the same crescent shaped bronze shield decorated with beautifully faceted gemstones. [PARAGRAPH]As the warmth faded Verchiel looked up into Mikel's face. "There is a sickness within Bourne. If you have faith we can heal the city. "[PARAGRAPH]"I do, I will. " said Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]At that Verchiel spread his wings, appearing exactly as he did in the window, and disappeared. [PARAGRAPH]"Mikel," Ceth said straining through Mikel's pressure on his throat, "what happened?"[PARAGRAPH]Mikel removed his hands to see two long scars on Ceth's throat. They were thick and bright red, but completely closed and the skin around the wounds looked fresh and healthy. [PARAGRAPH]"The angel healed you. " Mikel said, though he realized how strange those words sounded. [PARAGRAPH]Both men were broken out of their thoughts by the sound of the axeman Mikel had stabbed trying to get up. The axeman grabbed his side, weak from the loss of blood. Despite his obvious pain he was already standing and he raised his axe menacingly. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel rolled up and charged the axeman. Mikel's sword knocked the axe easily aside and Mikel set his shoulder low and into the axeman's chest. The axeman flew backwards, losing hold of his axe as he slammed into the side of a merchant stall and then fell hard against the ground. This time nothing silenced him and his cries were loud and profane. [PARAGRAPH]"I'll take care of him. " Ceth said picking himself up and grabbing his cudgel. [PARAGRAPH]"Are you sure you are okay?" Mikel said, but Ceth moved quickly, rolling the cursing axeman over and tying his hands. Despite the stains of blood on his neck, face and breastplate Ceth was completely recovered from the attack. [PARAGRAPH]"I'm going to warn the city guard, put him in the cell. " Mikel said. Then, without waiting for Ceth's answer, Mikel ran south along the bridge, chasing after the woman and the other attacker. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 4[PARAGRAPH]Mikel couldn't help feeling negligent in missing the next morning's dawn ceremony. As the morning bells rang out through the city he was sitting in a very crowded north bridge tower. Ceth was here as was Mikel's senior officer, Knight Commander Marlowe, and a crowd of other officers and priests. [PARAGRAPH]One of these priests was questioning the axeman, who gave his name as Cain the Torn, and who remained locked in the towers single cell. Mikel listened to the questioning as he and Ceth recounted their memories of the attack. [PARAGRAPH]"Cain, do you think your companions could have overcome the guard captain on their own?" the priest asked the prisoner. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes. " Cain answered. [PARAGRAPH]"Then why would you protect them if they abandoned you so easily? You would be dead if not for our care, left to die or be arrested while they escaped. There are two dead guardsmen, and nearly a third but for the grace of Lugus. Would you bear the burden for these crimes alone?"[PARAGRAPH]Cain didn't answer. He was still pale from the loss of blood and leaned against the cell wall. It was obvious the priest's persistent questions were having some impact on him. Seeing Cain wasn't going to respond the priest tried a different tact. [PARAGRAPH]"Cain, do you have a family. A wife and children?"[PARAGRAPH]"I did. " Cain answered, "I was much worse then. I lost control and killed them. "[PARAGRAPH]Cain seemed to be lost in the memory of the event. His answer quieted the rest of the people in the room, but the priest continued undeterred. [PARAGRAPH]"It is good you admit that. You would not want to die with that burden upon you. You can be forgiven, you can find peace. But this woman, she wanted you to continue killing, to use you. "[PARAGRAPH]"She. . . " Cain said looking up at the people in the room, "knows who I really am. "[PARAGRAPH]"It is not who you have to be. " the priest continued, "Your wife, she saw a different man. She knew who you really are. "[PARAGRAPH]"No," Cain said with emotion, "not until the night I killed her. That was the first time she really saw me. "[PARAGRAPH]The priest continued questioning but Cain didn't offer any further information, and nothing about his companions. Forgiveness and repentance may appeal to those raised in Bourne, but Mikel wasn't surprised the Sheaimic axeman was uninterested in the concepts. [PARAGRAPH]"This is a miracle. " Knight Commander Marlowe said placing his hand on Mikel's shoulder. "A vision, a warning and the life of one of our guardsman saved. This is a blessing not only to you but the city itself. It is an honor that Lugus would intervene. "[PARAGRAPH]"Yes sir. " Mikel said, "I feel like I should be at the dawn ceremony now, or out looking for the woman and the other man. "[PARAGRAPH]"A soldier always wants to be doing. But you are a part of the city, and without moving you are accomplishing both. Runners have been sent to all of the temples and guard stations in Bourne. The guards are all looking for them, and thanks are being offered in all the temples. " Marlowe answered. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel was surprised, he knew the runners had been sent to the guard stations, he had started that process last night. But knowing the priests were being told about his vision made him self-conscious. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth had it even worse. The priests were taking turns investigating the scars on his neck and treating him like a sacred relic. He had been choking on blood until, as if waking from a bad dream, the pain was gone. He thought he was dead except for the flood of cool night air in his lungs. Ceth hadn't seen the angel or known about it until Mikel told him. [PARAGRAPH]"Tomorrow why don't you and Ceth come to the dawn ritual at the Cathedral of Bells ? I am sure Luminary Rimmon would like to meet you. "[PARAGRAPH]"It would be an honor. " Mikel said, though the prospect of meeting the high priest of Bourne made him more nervous than the fight on the bridge. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth agreed to the invitation and the two stayed long enough to sign Cain over to the city guard, who would transport him to city prison. After stopping to give instruction to the day watch, Mikel set off for Dierdre's mother's manor. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel had sent a runner to Dierdre less than an hour after the fight, giving her a short explanation of what had happened and asking her to go to her mother's house to be safe. Mikel had ordered the runner to escort her to her mother's house. [PARAGRAPH]Dierdre's father had been a knight commander in charge of a thousand men. He died on the battlefield, giving his life for Lugus and Bourne in the autumn just after Dierdre's eighth birthday. Before he died he built the squat stone manor, now called Wyn Manor. [PARAGRAPH]The manor had four wings, but since Dierdre's mother AnnaSophia lived in it alone only the east wing remained open. Dierdre met Mikel as he entered the kitchen door the family most commonly used. AnnaSophia was in the kitchen behind her daughter pouring tea. Anna, who had tried to wait up for her father's return, had finally succumbed to sleep and was lost in a tangle of blankets on a couch in the adjoining great room. [PARAGRAPH]"What happened?" Dierdre said, unaccustomed to any change in the normal guard schedule. [PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia, whose marriage contained many mornings like this shooed her daughter away from the door and offered Mikel a seat at the kitchen table, which he gladly dropped into. Mikel didn't have time to speak before a cup of hot tea was placed before him, along with some dry rolls and a small pot of butter. [PARAGRAPH]"Thank you," Mikel mumbled as he ripped off a piece of bread and stuffed it in his mouth. [PARAGRAPH]Noticing Mikel was still covered with sweat and the spray of blood AnnaSophia went to wet a rag for him to clean off with. Before she could do so Dierdre also noticed the dried blood splattered line across his breastplate. [PARAGRAPH]"Is that blood?" Dierdre asked, her voice rising. [PARAGRAPH]"Quiet Diery. " AnnaSophia said, indicating where Anna slept. "Let Mikel eat a bit first, he is here and safe. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel quickly finished eating and washed the blood off his armor while he told both of the women what happened. Dierdre was stunned by Mikel's description of the angel and Ceth's healing, but AnnaSophia only listened carefully and waited until the story was complete to ask her question. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you tell anyone about your vision?" AnnaSophia asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes, of course, I told Knight Commander Marlowe and it was relayed to the guard stations and to the temples before dawn. "[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia's looked down, her brow furrowed, seemingly intent on the crumbs she was sweeping off the counter. [PARAGRAPH]"Do you think I shouldn't have?" Mikel asked. "Do you think I didn't really see an angel?"[PARAGRAPH]"I think you saw an angel. " AnnaSophia said quickly, "But I wonder how the church will accept your miracle and vision. These are rare events, it may be years before we hear of anything similar. What will the church expect of you because of it?"[PARAGRAPH]"They will know he is a hero. That the church did well to make him a captain. " Dierdre answered. [PARAGRAPH]"I am sure you are right. " AnnaSophia said, but she continued brushing off the counter though no crumbs remained. [PARAGRAPH]They talked for a few more minutes before Mikel's exhaustion began to catch up with him. After asking if he could borrow one of the guest bedrooms Mikel picked the sleeping Anna up off the couch and carried her into the bedroom where he placed her gently on the bed before collapsing beside her. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel's dreams where thick and muddy. The fight on the bridge mixed with those from his boyhood in Galveholm. He dreamt about Cain killing his wife and Herod Wyn, a man he had never met, who died in the service of Lugus leaving his wife widowed and his daughter fatherless. And though he searched in his dreams for another vision of the angel, it never came. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 5[PARAGRAPH]The noon bells woke Mikel. It had only been a few hours sleep, but it would have to be enough. He washed up before putting his armor back on. As he was putting his sword belt on he noticed his sword was still stained with Cain's blood. He took the sword out and cleaned it. [PARAGRAPH]The blood had even stained the blue ribbon tied around its hilt. Mikel felt suddenly angry he had been forced into a fight on the bridge, that they had attacked him and killed the other guards. That an angel had intervened and spoken with him, and that Ceth had been injured in the first place. He had hoped his days of sword fights were past. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel kissed Anna, who still lay sleeping peacefully on the bed, and headed down to the great room. [PARAGRAPH]Dierdre had taken her daughter's position on the couch and was snoring softly. AnnaSophia was still in the kitchen, though she peeked in when she heard Mikel before going back to her work. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel walked into the kitchen and saw she was packing a half loaf of bread, a bag of almonds and a fresh canteen. She set it out for him as Mikel entered the room. [PARAGRAPH]"Does this mean I'm leaving?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"If you stay I'll gladly cook you something better. But I don't think your coming downstairs for my cooking. " she answered. [PARAGRAPH]"No, you are right. " Mikel pocketed the food and the canteen then added, "Thank you for your help this morning. I was, I still am, overwhelmed. When Dierdre wakes up could you tell her to wait here for me and I'll come back tonight to walk her home. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course. " AnnaSophia said. [PARAGRAPH]With that Mikel headed out into the city on a walk to the city prison. It was a fair walk from Wyn Manor and he was glad to have the bread and almonds to snack on while he walked. [PARAGRAPH]Bourne was set in a series of low hills between the Fellin river, which the north bridge crossed, and the much larger Arduro straight to the south. The straight was too large for a bridge so the south side of Bourne was dominated by docks and warehouses. To protect the city from flooding a levee was built among the docks with a series of maze like sewer tunnels beneath. Since its construction the building has since been turned into the city prison, though it still goes by its original name, the Drain. [PARAGRAPH]A wall now surrounded the Drain and provided some protection from flood waters but Mikel felt nervous each time he entered the prison. [PARAGRAPH]"Afternoon captain. " a guard said as Mikel approached. Still fairly new to his role Mikel was surprised to see the respect accorded him by junior guards. And the few guarding the prison seemed even more impressed as they stood formally and one unlocked the outside gate to let him in. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel headed through the gate and down the gradually sloping stone staircase. Lamps were set in the walls, and though the staircase was clean and dry, moisture beaded on the walls. [PARAGRAPH]At the end the stairwell opened to the prisons main processing room. Almost a dozen guards worked here and four main shafts lead out to the converted cells. [PARAGRAPH]"Are you captain Alaunus?" a guard asked. He was sitting at a desk beside a woman draped in a cranberry shawl. [PARAGRAPH]At the mention of his name many of the guards, who had been talking to each other or filling out papers, stopped working and looked up. But the woman didn't turn. She sat facing the guard that had called for him, with her back to Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes I am. " Mikel said crossing the room to the guard's desk, "I was hoping to speak with Cain. I have a few questions about his purpose here in Bourne. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course captain. " the guard said. "He is in tunnel C. But we may have a witness that saw the woman who was traveling with Cain last night. " The guard indicated the woman sitting at his desk. [PARAGRAPH]The woman looked to be both frail and fierce. Her shawl was gathered tightly about her in the cool dungeon. The hands grasping at it were gaunt, little more than skin worn thin by years pulled over gnarled bone. But her clear grey eyes refused to admit weakness. She was angry, or annoyed, or her scowl was permanently fixed on her face. It was not a face accustomed to smiling. [PARAGRAPH]"Hello ma'am. " Mikel said. "I'm captain Mikel Alaunus of the north bridge. I fought with the woman and her guards last night. They killed two of my men. Can you describe the woman you saw?"[PARAGRAPH]The woman didn't answer, she just stared at Mikel in a way that made him feel guilty, though he wasn't sure what for. The guard broke the silence, reading from his notes. [PARAGRAPH]"Fisher Lizabeth Konal," the guard started, once again indicating the woman, "said her son was at the Sparrow last night being chatted up by young foreign lady who matched the description of the woman on the bridge. Pretty, with dark hair and cloak that was so dark red it was nearly black. She said any man in the bar would have been happy to pay for her, and didn't know why she would be wasting her time on her dullard of a son. "[PARAGRAPH]Seeing Mikel's look of surprise the guard quickly added, "That's from her description, not from me captain. "[PARAGRAPH]"Did you see her closely?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes, I went in to yell at my son. " Lizabeth answered, "To get him to the docks to work a shift but he was rooted to the bar stool as usual. That witch glared at me. I've seen more warmth in a corpse's eyes. " Her voice was a thin rasp entirely suited for her angry face. [PARAGRAPH]"Can we speak to your son?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"If you can find him. He's been missing since last night. " she answered. [PARAGRAPH]"We already have two men out looking for him and a patrol out searching the area around the Sparrow. " the guard added quickly. [PARAGRAPH]"Why would she want to talk to your son?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"No idea. The boy is as useless as a painting to a blind man. " she said. [PARAGRAPH]The old woman didn't seem willing to offer anything further. [PARAGRAPH]"Any thoughts soldier?" Mikel asked the guard. [PARAGRAPH]"No captain. By all accounts Anton Konal, that's her son, was a large man. Maybe a good six to nine inches taller than you. He was a guard for a brief time a few years ago but rarely reported to his shift and was let go. Now he spends his time drinking in the Sparrow, passed out on its floor or working as a dock hand. Fisher Konal's assessment of her son seems accurate. It's unlikely he is a secret Sheaim contact in the city, or of any real use to anyone. "[PARAGRAPH]Then, as if forgetting he was speaking in front of Anton's mother the guard added, "Sorry ma'am". [PARAGRAPH]"All true," she said. [PARAGRAPH]"It does sound like her. " Mikel said, "I will ask Cain about it. Soldier, if the patrol turns anything up would you let me know? I will be stationed at the north bridge tonight. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course captain. " the guard replied. [PARAGRAPH]After thanking Fisher Konal, Mikel headed down into Tunnel C. Mikel walked passed rows of cells, some empty and others filled with a mix of pickpockets, prostitutes and drunkards. After walking to the end of the first row and down a spiral staircase, Cain's cell became obvious. There was a small group of people standing outside it. [PARAGRAPH]Two guards stood silent watch outside the cell, another pair was inside. There was a man in an orange waistcoat who Mikel recognized as a local speaker, and a Literal with pale yellow robes was tending to a small brazier that was burning incense. Lastly captain Cerron, the head of the prison stood looking into the cell. Cerron noticed Mikel approaching. [PARAGRAPH]"Captain Alunus, welcome to the Drain. I'm sorry I haven't had a chance to make it out to the north bridge and congratulate you on your promotion yet. " Captain Cerron said. [PARAGRAPH]"Thank you captain," Mikel replied, "I know you are busy and it's only a matter of time before all the sentry captains get to meet with you. I am only sorry we couldn't be meeting over a less tragic incident. "[PARAGRAPH]"Yes, this one is a mystery. And I'm sorry to hear about your men. My son trained with soldier Ruen, he was a good man. " Cerron said. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes he was. " Mikel said. "How is the interrogation going?"[PARAGRAPH]"We haven't gotten much out of him. " Cerron answered. "He claims he and his companions were cutting through Bourne on their way to Galveholm and he doubts either of them are still in Bourne. He says the woman's name is Gosea and the other man's name was Mahon. The Literal is preparing for the kiss of the innocent so we know if he is lying or not. "[PARAGRAPH]"Do you mind if I ask him a few questions?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Captain Cerron checked with the speaker and the Literal, neither of which had any objection. [PARAGRAPH]"But I will need your weapons before you enter the cell. Just in case. " Cerron said. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel removed his sword belt and handed it to the captain. Then one of the guards unlocked the cell as the others stood ready for Cain to move. But Cain sat on a bench in the back of the cell with his head down and his curly hair hanging in front of his face. He didn't look up even as Mikel entered the cell, crossed it and sat down beside him. [PARAGRAPH]The two men were similar in size with deep coppery skin. They both had black hair and similar tattoos across their chest, back and arms. The connection was not lost on Mikel who was so accustomed to looking different that sitting by a man that could have been his brother was unsettling. [PARAGRAPH]"Have they told you about the kiss of the innocent?" Mikel began. With no sound from Cain he continued, "They heat a coal on the brazier, then pray over it. When their prayers are complete they will put it in your mouth. If you have been honest the coal will not burn you. If you have lied, then it will burn your mouth and tongue so badly you will never speak again. "[PARAGRAPH]"Do you believe that?" Cain asked, his head still down. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel was surprised by the question. He knew many questioned the impact of the gods in the world, but this was a man who traveled with a witch who could drink the sound out of an area and another who could stand on the end of a spear without adding any weight to it. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course I do. I have seen it performed many times. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"I've have some experience with torture. This technique is also used among the Sheaim but without the religious trappings. I think it originally came from the Bannor. It works because a lying man is more nervous, his mouth goes dry and the coal burns him. An innocent man has more moisture in his mouth so he isn't burned. That's assuming the coal is prepared at the right temperature. If it is too hot anyone will be burned by it. I suspect your preparation ritual is all about getting it to the correct temperature, at least I hope it is. " Cain said, finally looking up at where the Literal was still praying over the brazier. [PARAGRAPH]"Have you been honest?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Why wouldn't I be? The worst I've done you already know. I killed a couple of your men. I assume you are going to kill me for it. Why lie?"[PARAGRAPH]"Do you know where your companions are now?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Cain ignored the question. Looking at Mikel he asked, "Why did you become a rooster?"[PARAGRAPH]"I fled Galveholm because I was on the losing side of one of the street wars. I ended up here by accident, but I liked it. It was a better life and they are good people. Lugus revealed himself to me and allowed me to become something more than the thug and murderer I was. " Mikel answered. "In fact, that night on the bridge I saw an angel. It healed my lieutenant and told me there was a disease in Bourne I was to help cleanse. But it didn't tell me how. "[PARAGRAPH]"Why do you suppose the gods never tell us the whole story?" Cain asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I think it's because your friends are the disease and you know where they are. So I already have everything I need. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"You are wrong, I have no idea where they are. Probably halfway to Galveholm. I think the gods don't tell us the full story because if we knew how things were going to turn out, we would never follow them. " Cain said. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel considered Cain quietly. He didn't believe Cain was lying, but Mikel had been softened by years living in Bourne. People here were horrible liars, they became nervous and talkative. Among the Sheaim many had no guilt lying or killing, and they talked emotionlessly about both. [PARAGRAPH]"Your friend lived?" Cain asked. [PARAGRAPH]"My lieutenant, yes. The angel healed him. " Mikel answered. [PARAGRAPH]"Mahon isn't going to be happy about that. He likes to claim anytime he swings his axes, someone dies. As far as I know it has always been true. "[PARAGRAPH]"Do you think he will stay in Bourne long enough to kill Ceth?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"No, he will do what Gosea wants. And she is too practical to care about Mahon's streak or a guard that got away. " Cain said. [PARAGRAPH]"Any idea why Gosea was at a bar last night chatting up a local dock hand?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]For the first time Cain looked surprised. When Mikel asked again Cain denied knowing why she would be there, and this time Mikel was sure he was lying. Despite Mikel's attempts to get any more information Cain wouldn't talk. Hearing about the bar visit had scared him, or reinforced his loyalty. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel stayed long enough to watch the Literal place the coal in Cain's mouth. Though Cain attempted to take it willingly, to get the test over with quickly, his fear overcame him at the last second and he had to be restrained by the guards and the coal forced into his mouth. [PARAGRAPH]Cain was uninjured by the coal beyond some minor burns. It was enough for the Literal to proclaim he had been honest in all his answers. Mikel doubted that was the case. [PARAGRAPH]But it was getting close to time for the night shift. Though he felt like he hadn't gained any usable information Mikel thanked captain Cerron and headed out of the Drain on the long walk to the north bridge. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 6[PARAGRAPH]Anton Konal had been burning for nearly twenty hours. [PARAGRAPH]It hadn't been hard to lure him to the empty silo, he followed Gosea without complaint. Even though he towered over the petite witch, he hadn't tried to force himself on her. Instead he begged and offered clumsy compliments in an attempt to seduce her. Gosea was disgusted by him. [PARAGRAPH]The hard part was finding a place for the sacrifice. Since it was early spring many of the silos along the docks were empty, and Mahon found one large enough to construct what they needed without anyone seeing the fire. Gosea's magic would take care of the screams. [PARAGRAPH]Once Anton arrived Mahon tied him to the large post in the center of the empty silo. Anton was forced atop a pile of refuse from the docks, splintered crates and barrels, planks and rope. All were coated with lamp oil. [PARAGRAPH]Gosea lit the flames and they stood in perfect silence as Anton writhed in pain. The fire consumed his feet then up along his legs. His skin peeled and blackened, revealing thick layers of fat beneath that burned and melted like candle wax. There was so much fat on him that hot, liquid streams of it crawled down his legs and dripped hissing into the fire. [PARAGRAPH]In time he stopped screaming, but Gosea's magic wouldn't let him die. His voice was gone and the flames had eaten away all the unnecessary parts of him. Anton's massive frame, blackened and burnt, was little more than bones covered with thick muscle. [PARAGRAPH]That was when the ritual changed. Instead of being consumed by the fire Anton's body began consuming it. Mahon poured more lamp oil on the fire until the flames were as high as Anton's waist but Anton seemed empowered by it. The fire greedily licked at Anton's chest, arms and shoulders. It was absorbed and drawn into him. And over time a hot orange glow came from within his chest, and behind his eyes. [PARAGRAPH]There he stood, eyes fixed on Gosea in passive supplication. He was no longer alive, but unable to die. His most basic animalistic desires were tethered to his body by Gosea's spell. When the ritual was done Mahon cut him free and what had been Anton lumbered off the pyre, ready to receive Gosea's commands. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 7[PARAGRAPH]The midnight bells rang through the city. Dawn and noon were sacred times in Bourne, even dusk was seen as a time of reflection and rest. But there was little comfort in midnight. In the well ordered city this was the one time when strange things happened. And it was when the two guards standing attention at the Drain's outer gate spotted Anton Konal's corpse lumbering toward them. [PARAGRAPH]A cloak had been placed over him, but it was nearly burnt off. His body glowed like a coal, his skin and muscles were charred and black, but beneath the guards could see slivers of orange fire. Though the body lumbering toward them was on fire it was more terrifying that the flames didn't seem to bother it. [PARAGRAPH]The guards yelled for help before grabbing their spears. Neither had any desire to get close to the creature. [PARAGRAPH]They waited until they heard other guards running up the stairs out of the Drain before attacking. One stabbed Anton's corpse, and the creature made no attempt to avoid the spear. It punctured Anton's large chest and slid easily through. Anton hurried forward, up along the spear and grabbed the startled guard. His thick hands closed on the guards throats and the guards strangled screams were mixed with the pain of burning hands on his skin. [PARAGRAPH]"Shields men!" captain Cerron called, racing up the stairs behind his soldiers. "Do not waste yourself on lethal attacks, the creature has no vulnerable organs. Lop off any piece that gets close to you. "[PARAGRAPH]Following their orders the guards with shields readied them and closed with short blades and axes. Anton turned and the spear that was still stuck through him spun wildly, but when Anton reached for another soldier he was blocked by a shield. One guard sliced across Anton's back with a sword, and another, with a lucky blow from his axe, severed Anton's hand. [PARAGRAPH]Anton roared in anger. The places where he had been struck burned with an angry orange light. [PARAGRAPH]"Be patient men, we will bring this creature down. " Cerron called, readying his own shield as Anton's attention turned to him. [PARAGRAPH]Anton charged, and though two guards stabbed him with spears he ignored both attacks. One guard was whipped around by the force of the charging giant, the other spear snapped in half. [PARAGRAPH]Cerron dove toward the creature's left side. Though Anton had no hand on that arm he beat it furiously against the captain's shield like a giant club. Cerron deflected the attack and returned his own, ducking low and chopping into Anton's knee with his axe. [PARAGRAPH]Despite the lack of pain, or the need for lungs, heart or mind even the walking dead still need their knees. As the kneecap splintered Anton fell onto the street. [PARAGRAPH]The guards were quick to take advantage of the fall. Cerron spun to deliver another blow to the back of Anton's leg, nearly amputating it entirely. A flurry of other attacks rained down on the creature's body, each leaving an angry hot scar in its place. [PARAGRAPH]Anton shuddered and then his body exploded. With a final howl the flames were released from the prison of his burnt corpse and they swept out over the guards, the Drain front gate, and the surrounding buildings. The cobblestones burnt and fractured in the heat, the bodies of the soldiers did much worse. Helmets were melted to flesh, exposed skin was burnt down to bone. Cerron and his men were killed. [PARAGRAPH]There were only two guards left in the Drain, and they fell easily to Mahon's twin axes. [PARAGRAPH]"Split up and find Cain. " Gosea ordered, throwing Mahon the set of keys from one of the guards. "Let out anyone you find along the way. "[PARAGRAPH]Cain heard the explosion and knew what it was. By the time Gosea found his cell he was standing at the bars calling for her. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you tell them about the heartstone?" Gosea whispered as she unlocked his cell. [PARAGRAPH]"No, and they didn't ask about it. " Cain replied. "They just wanted to know where you were. I honestly told them I believed you would be halfway to Galveholm. "[PARAGRAPH]Gosea studied his face with eyes that revealed none of her thoughts. Then she handed Cain an axe she had taken from one of the guard's corpses. [PARAGRAPH]"Let us go. We don't have much time. " Gosea said. [PARAGRAPH]On the way up to the main processing room Cain saw that most of the cells were open and the prisoners had fled out into the city. Outside of one cell where the body of a prisoner lay dead on the floor. Cain guessed the excitement at his freedom had caused the man to try to take liberties with his beautiful rescuer. He hadn't even touched Gosea before she had killed him for it. [PARAGRAPH]They called for Mahon from the processing room and he ran up to meet them. Any prisoners that weren't released yet were left in their cells. Together the three fled up into the city. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 8[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stood floating above the high white walls of Bourne as dawn struck the great city. Once an angel had stood at each tower, divine guardians of this sacred city. The moniker Bourne the Gleaming was not due to the white walls, but the holy power that once permeated it. [PARAGRAPH]But that was centuries ago. In time, and across generations, the city had faded. The compact only allowed the gods, and their agents, to act when empowered by mortal faith. And there was little of that left in Bourne. [PARAGRAPH]As an angel of the god of revelation Verchiel stood silent witness to the triumphs and failures of the city, though there was little he could do to help, guide or protect its people. But each morning he prayed that it would get better, that through their faith he would be able to stand with them, that he could do more than watch them in pain. [PARAGRAPH]As Verchiel looked over the grey city the sun began to creep over its walls and light up the few citizens that had got an early start on the day. A baker plodded along the alleyway, yawning as he went. A young man rushed home, still swaying clumsily from the night before. [PARAGRAPH]From the heart of the city the cathedral bells rang and people headed to service. Born by the light streaming across the city Verchiel arched across the sky and as it struck the golden symbol of the Empyrean on the great Cathedral window Verchiel was there beside it. [PARAGRAPH]Inside parishioners talked in the muted tones of morning. Luminary Rimmon prepared himself for the morning service, thinking through the news of the attack and the way to calm the city before everyone learned about the prison breakin and the deaths of the guards. The Luminary was a decent man, more pragmatic than philosophical, more politician than priest. And though Verchiel had tried to go to him many times, the Luminary was unable to see or hear the angel. [PARAGRAPH]As the service started there was a flash of light from within the city, east of the cathedral. Not the light of fire or anything physical, but the outpouring of faith, of the true power of Lugus, the god of the Sun. [PARAGRAPH]It is hard to surprise an angel that has been with the world since the sun first shone upon it. But Verchiel was, for a long moment, stunned. Then, cautiously, he swept down from his perch on the cathedral and flew over the streets of Bourne. The people seemed unaware of the welling power, they opened their stands, brushed off their walks, or hurried to work as Verchiel swept over them. Until he found himself over a small plaza near the docs. Warehouses were on all sides, and this was typically used as a place for traders to meet and work out deals with the various ships docked nearby. But there were no new ships in yet today and the plaza was deserted. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel could feel the power here, it strengthened him and he noticed that, much like the city, he had faded as well. But the source of the power wasn't here in the plaza, it was under it. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel slipped down through the cobblestones and dirt and into the city sewers. He had rarely seen them before, it was rare that men of faith would have a reason to be in such dark corners. [PARAGRAPH]A symbol of the Empyrean was traced in gold on the smooth stone of the sewer platform. Light poured through it like a beacon and lit the chamber, sending light into places untouched by it for centuries. In the distance rats squeaked in frustration as they fled the area, and quieter predators slipped into the murky channels nearby and disappeared. [PARAGRAPH]On the other side of the sewer platform there was another rune, this one made of silver and inside it sat a woman with dark, empty eyes and skin that has never felt the touch of sunlight. [PARAGRAPH]She began talking while Verchiel looked around. She was looking right at him, though Verchiel couldn't hear her words. Behind her two men slept, seemingly unaware of what was happening, and she hadn't thought to protect them with the circle she used around herself. [PARAGRAPH]"Deceit and manipulation are as unknown to me as compassion to the fallen. " Verchiel said, "I cannot hear anything you say if it is not true. "[PARAGRAPH]As the woman considered, Verchiel looked within her. He was accustomed to some reaction from mortals that saw him, seeing the divine can make the corrupt repent, the simple pious, can make the devout transform. Even the most worldly had been awestruck by his presence. But this woman showed nothing. [PARAGRAPH]He saw within her a girl who didn't speak her first word until she was 8. She was raised in an asylum in Galveholm, and thought to be cursed or touched or simple. She spent years staring into the shadowed corners of her room and whispering to imagined things. Her eyes were the empty hopelessness of those who threw themselves off the high walls of Bourn, who cut themselves and watched with cold detachment as their life flowed out of them. The most remarkable thing about this woman was that she was here at all, Verchiel could see nothing within her that would motivate her to leave that small closet room at the asylum. A part of her may still remain there. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel was interrupted from his study as she spoke. [PARAGRAPH]"I want you to guide the people of this city to let us leave. If we have to fight our way out more people will die. " She said. [PARAGRAPH]"How did you consecrate this place?" Verchiel asked, ignoring her statement. [PARAGRAPH]"I didn't. " she said, "I opened a way to the Dies Diei, it is its light that you see, and feel, reflected here. "[PARAGRAPH]"And who are you?" Verchiel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I am Gosea the Dwindling, sorceress of Ceridwen. " She said. She said something after but it faded to nothing to Verchiel's ears, another lie. [PARAGRAPH]"Will you guide the city to let us leave?" Gosea asked. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel had heard of sorcerers trapping angels, but only in areas consecrated to the fallen. Bourne was no longer sacred, but he wondered if she thought it so weak that she could attack him, even beneath the city. [PARAGRAPH]"You are a husk, no different than the abomination you created from that poor dock worker. You are blind, afraid and alone. And you are dangerous. " Verchiel said. [PARAGRAPH]If his words had any effect on her, she didn't show it. "No," he continued, "I will guide them to stand against you and your queen. Faith opens our eyes, faith gives us courage and faith means that we are not alone. "[PARAGRAPH]With a thought Gosea extinguished the channel to Dies Diei. The light flickered out and the shadows rushed in to reclaim it. There was no attack from Gosea, she simply pulled her hood over her head and rested her chin on her palms while Verchiel slipped up through the top of the chamber and back into the daylight in the small plaza. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 9[PARAGRAPH]Gosea was still sitting in the runic circle when Mahon woke up. He stretched lazily and then stood up without bending his waist or using any momentum. He simply placed the soles of his feet on the floor and straightened his knees in denial of the fact that it should have been impossible to do so. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you commune with the dead?" Mahon asked, studying the circle. He had learned a little about sorcery while traveling with Gosea, but he didn't recognize any of the symbols she had carefully traced out. [PARAGRAPH]"No," she answered, "I spoke with an angel of Lugus, the one that sanctified this city. I was hoping we could skip this battle and get on to our task. "[PARAGRAPH]"I don't know much about angels. " Mahon said, "But I assume he didn't accept the offer. "[PARAGRAPH]"No. "[PARAGRAPH]"Should we be moving if he knows we are here? Can't he give someone a vision or commune with one of their sorcerers?" Mahon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I doubt there are any sorcerers talented enough to be able to see into the ether in Bourne. And holy men may be even rarer. The angel may be able to inspire those in his city, but they lack the faith to see or hear him, much as he might try. There are no miracles to be had in Bourne. "[PARAGRAPH]"I saw a miracle. " Cain said without moving. He was still on his bedroll, lying on his side and facing away from Gosea and Mahon. "The tower guard healed his companion, the one Mahon nearly decapitated. He prayed, and then it sounded like he was talking to someone. And his friend was healed. "[PARAGRAPH]"What was his name?" Gosea asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Mikel. " Cain said, "Captain Mikel Alaunus. "[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 10[PARAGRAPH]Just before dawn the next morning Mikel stood before the Cathedral of Bells. Ceth and Deirdre were with him. Deirdre was carrying Anna, who was slumped asleep on her mother's shoulder. [PARAGRAPH]All three were surprised to see that the cathedral was flooded with worshipers. And though it was the largest temple in the city, there were far too many people clamoring in front of the temple to get inside. [PARAGRAPH]"What's going on?" Deirdre asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know. " Mikel said, "Ceth, can you see if you can find Knight Commander Marlowe? I don't know if we are going to be able to find open seats for the service. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel and Deirdre waited outside and watched the crowd as Ceth tried to find Marlowe. At first Mikel wondered if the crowd may have gathered because of his vision. But these people seemed nervous and afraid. Judging by their clothing, many were from the docks. [PARAGRAPH]A few Literals came out of the temple and began to organize the crowd into smaller groups for prayers and sermons in the open square. Mikel was considering joining one when Ceth poked out of the cathedral and waved for Mikel and Deirdre to join him. [PARAGRAPH]"Marlowe has seats reserved for us. " Ceth said when they reached him. [PARAGRAPH]They followed Ceth into the cathedral. Compared to the small Fenestran temple the cathedral was a palace. A high arched foyer was decorated with candles and organ music from the nave could be heard echoing throughout. [PARAGRAPH]The nave was huge and shaped like an amphitheater, with two rows of balconies overlooking the main floor and a central stage where seven thrones faced a long, marble altar. Unlit candles wreathed the stage. Behind the stage a staircase seemed to ascend into a gold, topaz and amber sun design, but actually led to the cathedrals presbytery . [PARAGRAPH]"Luminary Rimmon would like to speak with you before the service. " Ceth said. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel followed Ceth up the cathedral's central aisle and onto the stage. Mikel felt the eyes of the crowded cathedral on their backs as they walked across the stage. It wasn't unusual to have guards in attendance, even in full uniform, but it was unusual to have them going to speak to the Luminary before the service. [PARAGRAPH]Knight Commander Marlowe was in the shallow preparation area behind the stage talking with Luminary Rimmon and a few Literals. Ceth and Mikel stood a respectful distance away until Marlowe waved them over. [PARAGRAPH]"Speaker Rimmon, allow me to introduce the soldiers I told you about. This is captain Mikel Alaunus and his lieutenant Ceth Kiln. " Marlowe said. [PARAGRAPH]"It is a pleasure to meet you captain. " Rimmon said, grasping Mikel's hand. Rimmon was a powerfully built man for a priest; he would be as comfortable on the battlefield as he was within the cathedral. His pale yellow robes and glittering necklace of sunstones contrasted with his short, practical hair and callous hands. [PARAGRAPH]"It is an honor. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"And you as well lieutenant Kiln. " Rimmon said, turning to Ceth. "Are those scars from the attack," He examined Ceth's neck, "and that were healed by the power of Lugus?"[PARAGRAPH]"Yes eyeman. I mean, yes Luminary. " Ceth said turning a bit red in the face. [PARAGRAPH]Rimmon smiled. "Eyeman is fine. You can even call me Rimmon if you want, though I have yet to meet a soldier that will do that. "[PARAGRAPH]After he was finished examining Ceth's scars Rimmon added, "And you captain Alaunus, you saw the angel?"[PARAGRAPH]"Yes Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"What did the angel look like?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"He appeared to be the angel from one of the stained glass windows in the Fenestran temple. Literal Edain identified him as Verchiel. He had skin like yellow glass with light shining through it. He appeared as a stained glass window come to life. " Mikel said. Mikel was sure that Rimmon had already heard the details of his vision, though it seemed he preferred to get an account directly from Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]"And what did he tell you?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"That there is a sickness within Bourne. That I can stop it if I have faith. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]Rimmon considered Mikel closely, much as he had investigated Ceth's scars. "Have you heard about the attack last night?"[PARAGRAPH]Mikel and Ceth exchanged concerned looks. [PARAGRAPH]"No Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"I'll let Marlowe fill you in on the details. " Rimmon said, "But the city is in a panic and I intend to use your vision to help bring calm. The people need to know that Lugus cares for us, that he is protecting us. Do you agree with that?"[PARAGRAPH]"Yes of course Luminary. " Mikel said, though he wasn't sure how he felt about his vision being used for propaganda. Or how protected the city really was if there had been an attack last night. [PARAGRAPH]After a pause Rimmon added, "Is there anything you left out of your story? Anything you would like to clarify? This is the time for brutal truth captain. "[PARAGRAPH]"No Luminary. " Mikel said, "I take the mandate of truth very seriously. It is exactly as I said. "[PARAGRAPH]"Very good captain. I don't mean to question your integrity, but before a sermon I have to make sure everything I say is true. I hope you understand. " Rimmon said. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]At that they were ushered to their seats. Marlowe had some set aside in the first balcony. There was even a seat reserved for Anna, though she preferred to sit on her mother's lap. [PARAGRAPH]"What was Luminary Rimmon like?" Deirdre whispered as they waited for the service to start. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know. " Mikel said, "He seemed worried about the city. "[PARAGRAPH]The touch of dawn light on the windows signaled the beginning of the service. Literal's funneled in from the foyer, each carrying a tall candle. As one they lit the candles around the stage, bringing the cathedral to light. [PARAGRAPH]Luminary Rimmon came up from the back of the stage with a large tome in his hands. He set the tome on a stand and then thanked the Literals, who bowed slightly and retreated to the edges of the room. [PARAGRAPH]"Another day has come, another promise has been kept. " Rimmon said. Then he paused, looking out at the assembled faces and down at his notes. Seeming to abandon his notes Rimmon spoke directly to the room. "We were attacked last night and eleven guardsmen were killed. In the docks some buildings caught fire and nearly three dozen prisoners escaped from the Drain. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel and Ceth looked first at each other and then at Marlowe, who returned their looks with a slight nod. They seemed to be the only ones in the room who didn't know about the attack. [PARAGRAPH]"Captain Cerron was one of the men killed. " Marlowe whispered. [PARAGRAPH]"Did Cain escape?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Marlowe nodded again. [PARAGRAPH]"It was a horrible night. " Rimmon continued. "But it is day now, and Lugus has not forgotten the people of Bourne. Many of you have heard rumors of a miracle on the north bridge, and I can tell you that it is true. An angel saved the life of a guard near death and delivered a message to one of our captains warning us of the coming danger. "[PARAGRAPH]There were audible gasps from the audience. [PARAGRAPH]"That captain is with us, Captain Mikel Alaunus. As well as the man the angel saved, Lieutenant Ceth Kiln. " Rimmon gestured toward where Mikel and Ceth sat on the balcony and everyone in the temple craned to see them. "Lieutenant Kiln still carries the scars from the attack but he has recovered. The city of Bourne is unchanged. "[PARAGRAPH]Rimmon continued with his sermon, comforting and encouraging the audience to stand firm, to carry a message of hope out to the city. But Mikel lost track of his words. The angel Verchiel was walking down the center aisle of the nave, and no one seemed to notice. [PARAGRAPH]The angel's wings were spread, and exactly as he had appeared before his skin seemed to glow like the sun through honey. In his left hand he held his familiar crescent shaped shield, but in his right he held a sword that burned with a perfect golden fire. [PARAGRAPH]The light from Verchiel was nearly blinding. It reflected from every surface in the cathedral and yet no one turned to look at him. When he walked between the people and where they sat looking at Rimmon they continued to look straight ahead. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stopped at the front of the aisle, directly in front of Rimmon. If anything Rimmon may have squinted his eyes in the light, but he continued his sermon and ignored the angel. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel looked at Dierdre and Ceth, but neither seemed to notice the angel. They both sat contentedly listening to Rimmon's sermon as the angel turned and walked to the edge of the room, where a single Literal stood watching the sermon. The Literal was an old woman, as old as Mikel had ever seen working at the church. She was thin, with grey hair and age spots on her wrinkled skin. Her face was etched with wisdom and sadness. And Mikel was sure she could see the angel. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stopped in front of the woman and spoke to her. Mikel couldn't hear the angel's words, but they sounded compassionate and kind. The woman's eyes filled with tears, then she looked away and hurried out of the cathedral. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel's light dimmed with her loss. Then with a great flap of his wings Verchiel took off into the open air of the cathedral and soared toward where Mikel was sitting in the balcony. He landed easily on the balcony rail, just in front of Dierdre, though she continued to stare through him at Rimmon just as the rest of the room was. [PARAGRAPH]"We are at the center of the sickness. I will show you that which blinds others. " Verchiel said. [PARAGRAPH]And with that the world changed to one painted in grays. Around him the ghost-like figures of the cathedral dreamed, whispered, cried or simply sat apart from the world around them. Though an angel, who retained his radiant orange and yellow colors, stood a few feet from them they didn't see him. [PARAGRAPH]"Why can't they see you?" Mikel whispered. [PARAGRAPH]"Fear, ambition, apathy. " Verchiel said, "In some cases even hope or love can bind them. Anything that can keep a man from fully trusting the divine. I have stood eternal guard over them and the city, and in too many cases I have been forced too only watch as they have suffered. I can touch upon the power of Lugus, but only as the faith of man allows. "[PARAGRAPH]"How can that faith be restored?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"We must pierce the darkness. " Verchiel and Luminary Rimmon both said at once. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel was momentarily confused by hearing the two voices together, but Rimmon continued with his sermon, unaware he had answered Mikel's question or had spoken in concert with an angel. [PARAGRAPH]"What can I do?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Tell your command to maintain the guards at the gates. Although they are dangerous, one of their number is injured. One of them could escape at any time by walking across the river. But the sorceress is weakened in this city, her strength will not return on this ground and she will not escape unless we allow it. "[PARAGRAPH]With that Verchiel was gone and the cathedral dropped back to the normal colors of the world, though to Mikel's eyes they seemed more drab after watching the angel. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel listened and prayed as Rimmon finished the sermon, offerings were accepted and the crowd seemed more generous on the eve of the tragedy, or more hopeful to buy some of Lugus's goodwill. [PARAGRAPH]After the closing prayer everyone rose and began funneling out of the cathedral. Mikel touched Deirdre's arm as she was about to leave. [PARAGRAPH]"Go home. " Mikel said. "I have to speak to Marlowe, I will be home soon. "[PARAGRAPH]"Come home with us. " Deirdre said, pulling at his shirt. "You have already done so much. "[PARAGRAPH]"I'll be home later. " Mikel said, then softening he kissed his wife and his daughter. "I will be okay. "[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre looked ready to argue but she let it go. She whispered something to him, but it was lost in the surrounding voices and then she was gone in the crowd heading out of the building. [PARAGRAPH]"Knight Commander," Mikel said, "may I speak with you and the Luminary Rimmon again?"[PARAGRAPH]Marlowe looked surprised, but he nodded and Marlowe, Mikel and Ceth worked their way against the crowd and down to the altar where Rimmon stood comforting a few of the parishioners that had approached him after the service. [PARAGRAPH]Intimidated by the arrival of the soldiers the parishioners said a quick goodbye and left Rimmon alone with them. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes Captain?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel became suddenly self-conscious, he looked around to see if he could see the angel, but Verchiel was gone. [PARAGRAPH]"The angel spoke to me again, during your service. " Mikel said. Ceth's eyes widened and Marlowe looked nervous. If Rimmon showed any emotion it was only a slight pursing of his lips. [PARAGRAPH]"And what did he say?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel relayed the story as he remembered it, from the vision of the gray cathedral full of parishioners wrapped in their own worries, to the warnings about watching the gates and continuing to look for Gosea and her companions. [PARAGRAPH]Rimmon listened to the whole story and considered his words carefully before asking, "Why do you think an angel would tell you to have us do something we are already doing?"[PARAGRAPH]"I don't know Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"Why do you think the angel delivers these messages to you instead of," Rimmon paused here, picking his words carefully, "more senior members of the temple?"[PARAGRAPH]"I don't know Luminary. " Mikel answered again. [PARAGRAPH]"Your vision and the people in this cathedral that couldn't hear the angel because of their more earthly concerns, did that apply to me as well?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel began to answer that he didn't know again. But he did know, and he again thought of his vows and the Mandate of Truth. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes Luminary, I believe it did. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel kept his eyes down on the floor, he didn't want to know what expression was on Rimmon's face. [PARAGRAPH]"Is there anything else captain?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"No Luminary. "[PARAGRAPH]With that Rimmon turned and walked back across the stage and into the presbytery. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 11[PARAGRAPH]It was a long walk back to Wyn Manor. Mikel had said goodbye to Ceth and Marlowe at the Cathedral of Bells and he kept his head down as he walked across the city. A few people called out to him as he passed, even some he didn't know and he half-heartedly returned their calls. [PARAGRAPH]He entered the Wyn manor kitchen as he had before, the kitchen smelled good and there was a fresh plate of bread and cheese sitting on the table. [PARAGRAPH]"Diery?" AnnaSophia called from upstairs. [PARAGRAPH]"No," Mikel called back, suddenly shaken out of his dark thoughts, "It's Mikel. Did Deirdre leave?"[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia came into the kitchen and her expression answered Mikel's question. Before she said anything he was back out the door and running toward the small house he shared with his wife and daughter. [PARAGRAPH]She wasn't supposed to go home alone, but maybe she forgot something. Maybe Anna wanted one of her toys. There is no chance that, out of all of the people of Bourne, Deirdre and Anna would run into Gosea. But somehow Mikel knew that was exactly what happened. Cain knew who he was. Everyone in the city was talking about them, it wouldn't have been hard to find out he had a wife and daughter. [PARAGRAPH]By the time he reached his house his world began falling apart one piece at a time. First the note pinned to the front door with a hairpin like Deirdre wore. He opened it with shaking hands. [PARAGRAPH][PARAGRAPH]Mikel,[PARAGRAPH]Order your men, claim a vision, do whatever you need to do to draw the guards away from the harbor gate tonight. If you do so, we will leave the city without incident. If you don't we will sacrifice your wife and your sweet daughter to Ceridwen, the breaker of men, and then kill many more on our way out of your dusty city. [PARAGRAPH]The choice is yours. Cain hopes you deny us, your wife reminds him of his own. [PARAGRAPH] - Gosea[PARAGRAPH][PARAGRAPH]Mikel was back at Wyn manor. He hadn't noticed the walk back, the city was a distant echo, a world apart from the prison of fear collapsing on him. AnnaSophia met him in the yard, and though she asked questions he couldn't understand them. He only held out the note as explanation. She read it and rushed him into the house. [PARAGRAPH]"Mikel, Deirdre needs you. Anna needs you. " AnnaSophia said, that at least echoed through to him. [PARAGRAPH]"I'm here. " Mikel replied, "I understand. " He tried to force the fear away. I need to get to the guard station, I need. . . to pray. "[PARAGRAPH]"No," AnnaSophia said, her voice perfectly calm, her eyes as focused and adamant as any knight commander. "You must do what they want. "[PARAGRAPH]"I cannot forsake Lugus. " Mikel said, "He will protect Deirdre and Anna, he will protect us if we remain faithful. As he did with Ceth. "[PARAGRAPH]"I have lost one faithful family member in Lugus's service already, I will not offer up my daughter and granddaughter!" AnnaSophia nearly screamed, her resolve falling apart like shattered glass. "Do you imagine that the faithful never fail, that they never suffer, that they never die? That I didn't once tell myself that Lugus would protect what I loved and bring him home safe? You can bring her home safe, you are the only one. "[PARAGRAPH]"Let me pray. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 12[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel knew Deirdre and Anna were being held in an abandoned workshop near the docks. He knew that Cain was watching them and that if the guards rushed the building they could save them before Cain could kill them. But there was a reason Gosea had taken Mikel's wife, she didn't know if she could control him, but she knew she could destroy him. And now Verchiel watched the small flicker of Mikel's faith, that gateway that allowed him to speak to Mikel, go out. [PARAGRAPH]Though Mikel prayed, though tears ran down his face and he desperately wanted to hear, and though Verchiel stood beside him in spirit, with tears streaming down his own face, that vast chasm of fear and doubt kept them apart. [PARAGRAPH]"Your desire to be faithful isn't enough. " Verchiel whispered. "You must give up your fear, you must place your faith in Lugus and I will make you a beacon that will drive away the night. "[PARAGRAPH]But Mikel couldn't hear him. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 13[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia hands only trembled a bit as she sipped her tea. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you get an answer?" she asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel stood up, still stunned as he had been ever since he saw the note, but he no longer had the delusion of a quick solution. [PARAGRAPH]"No, I saw the angel before, he talked to me, I don't know why he won't come now. "[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia didn't offer an answer. [PARAGRAPH]"I love my city, I love my religion and I love Lugus. " She said carefully. "But there is a limit to all things. Maybe I'm weak, but we can't sacrifice the people we love for our beliefs. It doesn't serve Lugus to let them die. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel picked up the note and headed out the manor's front door. [PARAGRAPH]"Are you going to save them?" AnnaSophia asked. [PARAGRAPH]He stopped in the doorway with his back to her. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know. " Mikel said, it was all he could offer before he headed out into the street. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 14[PARAGRAPH]Mikel met Commander Marlowe and Luminary Rimmon at the Cathedral of Bells. The vaulted ceilings of the cathedral had never seemed more empty, and though they stood close together and talked in hushed tones in the empty cathedral, their voices echoed back them in conspiratorial whispers. [PARAGRAPH]"I know what they are going to try to do. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]Marlowe hadn't questioned Mikel's request to meet at the temple with Rimmon. Both men could see the concern and panic on Mikel's face and in his voice. Though they waited, Mikel didn't say anything. [PARAGRAPH]"Is Deirdre okay?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel's head fell into his hands. "No Luminary, she's not. They took her and Anna. I don't know where they are. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel explained the note and the threat as they listened. [PARAGRAPH]"Maybe we are best to let them flee the city, and we will have the best chance to save Mikel's wife and daughter. Commander do you really think you could stop them if they wanted to fight their way out? The witch's power is considerable. " Rimmon said. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know Luminary. " Marlowe answered. "But they have killed my men, our brothers, I still have families to meet with. Though more may die, I cannot simply let them go unavenged. "[PARAGRAPH]"What are your thought's Captain? Am I to assume that you wish to fight the battle since you declined their offer to mislead us?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I am bound by the Mandate of Truth. " Mikel said, "And I remain devote to the sun, even during deepest night. What if we pretend to abandon the gate?"[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 15[PARAGRAPH]Mahon slipped in the small home through a panel in the roof, falling to the floor with the grace of a dancer stepping from one step to another. [PARAGRAPH]"Did they clear the gate?" Gosea asked. [PARAGRAPH]"They are pretending to. Soldiers are disguised as commoners, some are hidden in the gatehouse. The chains inside the gate hang unlocked, but they have attached another set on the other side of the gate. "[PARAGRAPH]"What needless sacrifice. " Gosea said, mostly to herself. "Cain, kill the mother and child. "[PARAGRAPH]"Does it matter?" Cain asked, and though Gosea's dark eyes didn't reflect any irritation at his question, she did study him closely. [PARAGRAPH]"I assumed we would kill them either way. " Mahon said as he settled on the couch. [PARAGRAPH]"It's a spiritual game we play. " Gosea answered. "If the captain would have betrayed his city and god, then I have no need for his family, he is broken. But if he has chosen to trust his faith, then I cannot allow that fire to burn at our back. I cannot have his faith rewarded or we risk a new enemy for Galveholm. "[PARAGRAPH]"If we kill his family, he will be an enemy of Galveholm. " Cain said. [PARAGRAPH]"A man of faith can do more than an army of soldiers. He is useless broken. Kill his family. "[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 16[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel dropped to his knees and cried. He was an angel of Lugus, lord of the dawn and revelation, but he was unable to deliver his message. He knew where Mikel's wife and daughter were imprisoned, Verchiel was kneeling beside them in the ether. But Mikel was too full of fear and doubt to hear the angel's voice. Even now the witch and her guards were in the small homes common room planning to kill their prisoners. Deirdre and Anna had only a few minutes left to live. [PARAGRAPH]"Why are you crying?"[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stopped in surprise. He looked up to see see the innocent face of Anna looking at him quizzically. [PARAGRAPH]"Can you see me child?" Verchiel asked, equally puzzled. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course. " she said, "What is your name?"[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre sat staring at the iron bound door of the cell as she had since she was taken. The room was an old cellar and still had a pile of old tools and supplies in it. She had been through it a dozen times but there was nothing that could help her escape. She tried to stay strong and save her tears for when her daughter wasn't watching. She was so lost in her thoughts it took her a minute to realize Anna was holding a conversation with an old broom. [PARAGRAPH]"Chipmunk, who are you talking to?" Deirdre asked. [PARAGRAPH]Anna smiled, "His name is Verchiel, he's an angel and he will help us get back to daddy. "[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre had no words. At three years old her daughter had gone crazy. Deirdre wasn't sure if she should be jealous of her daughters hope, or condemn her for it. [PARAGRAPH]"We need something shiny" Anna said, going through the pile of supplies. She finally found an old copper plate that seemed to satisfy her and she started cleaning it with the hem of her dress. [PARAGRAPH]Deirdre heard the door to the cellar open. It was barely an hour since they had been fed and an unexpected visit from their kidnappers couldn't be good. Deirdre pulled Anna into her arms and when she squirmed Deirdre told her to be quiet. [PARAGRAPH]There was a jingle of keys and the cellar door opened. Cain, the largest of the kidnappers, opened the door. He had his axe drawn. [PARAGRAPH]"Sorry" he said with some sympathy, "your husband's too stubborn for his own good. "[PARAGRAPH]At that Anna tore free of her mother's grip and stood protectively in front of her. She held the polished copper plate above her head and Cain stepped back slightly at the sudden move. Nothing happened. [PARAGRAPH]Then Anna asked the broom, "What do I say?"[PARAGRAPH]"Come on. " Cain said. "There's no joy in killing a child. But you won't be my first. "[PARAGRAPH]"You cannot hide your actions" Anna shouted in a voice half her own and half unworldly, "Lugus will reveal all. If you mean to escape, then flee now into the darkness; this area has been claimed by the rose of summer!"[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre was stunned. But Cain wasn't about to be cowed by a three year with an old plate, and he stepped towards Anna. [PARAGRAPH]The copper plate exploded in light. It was as if Anna held the sun above her head. Cain covered his eyes in pain as light flooded the cellar, the small stairway and up in-to the home. Inside the house it rushed over Mahon and Gosea and broke free of every window or crack in the home's walls and spilled out onto the dark streets of Bourne and through the patchwork roof up into the night sky. [PARAGRAPH]Everyone in Bourne who had ever whispered a silent prayer to Lugus felt the stirring of holy power. The guards hidden at the harbor gate threw off their disguises and rushed to the home, as did the nearby watch and the local eyemen. [PARAGRAPH]Cain tried to stand against the waves of blinding light even though it burnt through to his closed and shielded eyes. He placed his axe in front of him and risked one peek at where he thought Anna was standing. When he looked he saw a golden angel standing before him with a blazing sword. [PARAGRAPH]"My arda is upon these two, you will not harm them. " the angel said. [PARAGRAPH]Cain raised his axe and pressed forward, but he was engulfed in light. Every darkness within him was undone, every cruel, pained memory swallowed like shadows chased out of a brightly lit room. Cain slumped back against the wall, his arms fell to his side and he dropped the axe on the floor. There were no memories left, and he stared up into the light with the innocence of a child. [PARAGRAPH]"It's okay. " Anna said as she stepped forward and took his large calloused hand in hers. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 17[PARAGRAPH]As the light exploded out of the small house's cellar Mahon and Gosea both fled out into the street. [PARAGRAPH]"Take the Heartstone. " Gosea said, pushing the delicately wrapped package into Mahon's hands. "Get it to Tebryn, get out of this city. "[PARAGRAPH]"I won't leave you alone. " Mahon argued. [PARAGRAPH]City guards carrying lanterns were already flooding onto the street, the site of the house still bursting with light caused them to pause briefly, but they would see Ma-hon and Gosea soon. [PARAGRAPH]"I am never alone. " Gosea said. "Get over the wall, now!"[PARAGRAPH]Mahon turned to look at the nearly 40 foot tall stone wall, "I'm going to need some help. " he said to himself. [PARAGRAPH]Gosea turned toward the guards and was careful to stay away from any of the beams of light streaming out of the house. [PARAGRAPH]"Sino, Vulnero, Dolor, Carcer, Ictus. . . " and on Gosea went, naming the myriad of spirits bound into her rings, runes and tattoos. At each name a spirit flew from her, a few, then dozens as her calls blurred together and became as wild and powerful as a storm at sea. Each spirit followed her command and jumped into the lanterns the guards carried, possessing the fire, gathering the oil about them and then leaping out onto the guards or the surrounding buildings. [PARAGRAPH]Guards screamed and rolled on the ground, but these flames couldn't simply be doused, they would leap off the guards and leap back. Guards tried patting each other down, or throwing their cloaks on each other, but it only caused confusion and the flames continued to dance among them. [PARAGRAPH]"Obey me" Gosea shouted as she flung her hands up over her head, away from the guards and toward the wall. As one, all of the flames streaked through the night air like dragonfire and struck the wall, sending oil straying in all directions, creating a pillar of thick, black smoke. But the wall had survived sieges, outside of some char marks it was unaffected. [PARAGRAPH]Commander Marlowe and Mikel reached the street in time to see the scattered guards still trying to understand what had happened. Marlowe immediately began shouting orders for the men to form up and prepare to rush the house, a squad was ordered to start triaging buckets of water and the injured were pulled back behind the lines. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel saw Gosea and Mahon standing silhouetted by the fire burning against the city wall. [PARAGRAPH]"Wait, Mikel. " Marlowe yelled, "They aren't going anywhere, they are trapped. "[PARAGRAPH]"No, they're not. " Mikel yelled back as he drew his sword and charged toward them. [PARAGRAPH]"Go!" Gosea shouted to Mahon. Spurred on by her words he sprinted toward the burning wall. Gosea turned to face Mikel, and her face was as pale and impassive as the moon. Even shadowed by the burning wall behind her Mikel could still see those immutable dark eyes. [PARAGRAPH]"Surrender!" Mikel shouted. [PARAGRAPH]Gosea didn't reply. Meaning to push quickly by her, Mikel dipped down, sweeping his sword low, below her arm and towards her thigh for a cut that would be painful, but not lethal. [PARAGRAPH]At the last moment Gosea moved toward Mikel, stabbing at him from a thin dagger in a hand that had appeared empty. The dagger went right through Mikel's arm, catching itself between the twin bones of the forearm and digging all the way through until its point poked out of the other side of his arm. This stopped his swing and she used his momentum, and her leverage to spin him around. [PARAGRAPH]Blinded by pain Mikel slammed the metal gloved fist of his other hand into Gosea's face. The witch's head snapped back, her nose shattered and her facial features swam as bones broke and gave way under the force. She let go of her knife and collapsed backwards onto the street. [PARAGRAPH]Nearly choking on blood Gosea spoke one more name, "Peractio. "[PARAGRAPH]A winged serpent the size of a man burst painfully up out of Gosea. Flowing from every part of her it filled her mouth, her nose, her ears and though she tried to scream, the serpent kept her from doing so. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel pulled the dagger out of his arm and switched his sword to the other hand just in time to block the serpent's first attack. Though his sword cut right across the serpent's body, the steel did not injure the demonic creature. [PARAGRAPH]The serpent lunged again and Mikel was forced to back up against the house. In the distance he could see Gosea struggling to get back up on her feet and the end of Mahon's sprint toward the burning wall. Instead of being stopped by the wall Mahon jumped up and stepped on the billowing smoke, riding it up and continuing to jump from black, ashy plume to plume to the top of the wall. [PARAGRAPH]With his back to the small house Mikel ducked another attack by the serpent and brought his sword up in a wide arch, an attack the serpent easily avoided as his sword plunged into one of the house's closed shutters. With his weapon trapped the serpent hissed, his eyes were cold, black and empty and for a brief second Mikel was lost in the utter lack of passion or rage in them. [PARAGRAPH]Then Mikel ripped the shutter off of the window and the serpent was bathed in the streaming white light bursting out of the house. The creature howled the sound of wind rushing down an endless pit and broke apart like oil consumed by fire. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 18[PARAGRAPH]Gosea was quickly apprehended. The enigmatic witch was gone, replaced by a scared young woman who cursed the guards, the city and Lugus loudly and with great fervor. Though riders were sent from the gate to chase down Mahon, he wasn't found. [PARAGRAPH]But it was Marlowe's voice that drew Mikel's attention. The soldiers had charged into the house, whose light was beginning to dim, and the commander's voice thundered above the burning fire, the screaming witch, and the growing amount of soldiers rushing into the square. It was a call of something more important than battle and demons and Mikel rushed to get to him. [PARAGRAPH]The soldiers parted as Mikel rushed into the house where his wife and daughter stood smiling and uninjured. Mikel swept them both up into his arms. It was hours before he let go of either of them. [PARAGRAPH]</Italian>
		<Spanish>Gosea can channel spirits, usually demons, but has no ability to control them. Instead they possess her and use her as a puppet. She has power, but no will, and she is helpless to be anything but a victim to the forces that control her. [PARAGRAPH:4]Fideism[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 1[PARAGRAPH]Stained glass windows decorated the walls of the Fenestran temple. The windows were so large the walls seemed more glass than stone. The windows on the east favored yellow while those on the west side of the temple favored orange which caused the airy temple to change hue throughout the day. [PARAGRAPH]The temples dome was topped by a plain round window so at noon, as it was now, it was at its brightest. The light reflected off the temples polished bronze columns, leaving few shadows in the large room. The rooms focus was at its center where a pillar of light fell on a priest wearing pale yellow robes and the man that knelt before him. A small group of friends and family dotted the first few pews of the temple, a modest but proud turnout. [PARAGRAPH]"In duty and honor I consecrate this man to you dear Lugus, rose of summer. So that his life and spirit may be yours, to use and guide as you see fit. Bless him and keep him in your care as he remains vigilant to your will and that of the church. "[PARAGRAPH]"Arise Mikel Alaunus, new man of Bourne. " the priest continued. "As a humble servant of Lugus and this city I consecrate you as captain Alaunus, champion of the dawn, holy knight in the army of Bourne the Gleaming. Arise and accept the mandate of truth, throw your secrets away and join the revealing light of Lugus. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel stood. He was nearly a head taller than the young priest and his broad shoulders were evident even beneath the loose ceremonial tunic. His skin was the color of copper, as compared to the milky cast of the others in the room, and where his tunic fell low on his neck the black swirl of a tattoo could be seen. Mikel wasn't afraid of the mandate of truth, but public speaking, even to this small crowd, made him nervous. [PARAGRAPH]"I grew up in an orphanage in Galveholm, capital of the Sheaim empire. " Mikel began. "The orphanage wasn't like those here in Bourne. It wasn't a place to raise children, it was a place to store them. Galveholm is a brutal, violent city, full of promise and power for those willing to take it, and little protection for anyone else. "[PARAGRAPH]"I killed a man, a boy really, when I was twelve. His name was Augess and though he was only a year younger, he was small for his age. I struck out of habit more than any real malice, but he was angry at the way we treated him. He attacked me. He was in a rage, but still too weak to hurt me. I became angry too, and I killed him in the orphanage stairwell surrounded by the cruel cheers of the other boys. "[PARAGRAPH]"By the time I was fifteen I had killed two more. I was a murderer, an extortionist, a thief and a liar. My skill with a sword made me useful to cruel men. But when the man I worked for was assassinated, when others who worked for him began to die, I fled. "[PARAGRAPH]"I worked on caravans and ships before ending up in Bourne. I knew as soon as I saw this city I wanted to stay here. The cities high white walls, the battlements that seemed to be topped with gold and the cathedrals that dotted the city's skyline were all so different from the twisted towers and dark alleys of Galveholm. "[PARAGRAPH]"I was nearly arrested when I tried to enter the city. I am Sheaimic by birth and my tattoos are not only evidence of my past, but illegal in Bourne. After speaking with Gate Captain Marlowe he agreed to allow me my freedom if I worked on a local farm and stayed out of the city. I did so, working for Ferris Tawns, for just over three years. "[PARAGRAPH]"Ferris was a wonderful boss, and the years spent on his farm were my happiest to that point in my life. "[PARAGRAPH]Ferris and his wife, who were sitting near the back of the small group, didn't display any emotion at the praise. This wasn't simple appreciation, but a religious ceremony and everyone understood that regardless of what was revealed, the mandate of truth wasn't about those in the story, it was about the speaker. [PARAGRAPH]"I am ashamed to say I stole from Ferris while I worked from him. Though he shared his table with me, and paid me well I stole small things I could sell to traders on the road. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel was relieved to notice Ferris and his wife remained stoic. That was harder for him to admit than the murders. Failing after changing his life seemed like a bigger loss than the things he had done before. [PARAGRAPH]"Gate Captain Marlowe kept in touch with me and made sure his mercy was well placed. He eventually allowed me to travel with Ferris to the city's market to sell produce, and I enjoyed those trips. I befriended the market guards and when they were looking for new recruits, with Ferris and Marlowe's blessing, I applied. "[PARAGRAPH]"I have been working in the market for the past seven years. It was where I met my wife Deirdre, who I love deeply. We have been married for five years and four years ago we had a daughter, Anna. "[PARAGRAPH]Anna was unable to maintain the stoic expression and beamed at the mention of her name. Though Deirdre looked outwardly passive and listening, Mikel knew she was nearly as nervous as he was. The mandate of truth caused a lot of new knights to reveal past infidelities and crimes that sometimes destroyed families. Mikel was delighted he had no transgressions against his marriage, wife or daughter to admit. [PARAGRAPH]"Shortly after Anna's birth I began to feel drawn to the cities temples. Deirdre's father had been a knight commander in the church and gave his life in service to Lugus. My friend and fellow guardsman Ceth spent many shifts talking about his faith and the Empyrean . In time I began attending dawn rituals with him and my family. "[PARAGRAPH]"Three weeks ago I was offered the opportunity to become a knight in the service of Lugus and lead my own guard unit on the north bridge. I am undeserving of this honor, but I will give my devotion, my life, and my eternal soul, to the service of Lugus and to this city. "[PARAGRAPH]At this Mikel knelt again. [PARAGRAPH]The priest rubbed his thumb in a small pot on his belt, scooping out honey colored oil which he rubbed on Mikel's closed eyes. [PARAGRAPH]"Remember you carry the mandate of truth with you always. " the priest intoned. "Open your eyes to a world without deception, live your life revealed and without fear. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel opened his eyes. The oil burned and through the amber haze the bright temple appeared even brighter. Mikel could hear the people in the pews standing up and talking to each other, friends congratulating his wife. But he could only see a dizzying dance of light. The stained glass windows, once beautiful but lifeless, now glowed with an inner fire that made them seem alive. Angels and saints of the Empyrean looked down at him in full radiant glory. And one, an angel with a crescent shaped shield and a hand lost to golden light, seemed to float apart from the window. The angel looked down at Mikel with a look of passive benevolence. The angel reached out its burning hand, as if to touch Mikel on the forehead. But the light was too bright and although Mikel's eyes teared up as he tried to watch the vision, he was forced to blink and the room returned to normal. The angel was once again just a figure in the window. [PARAGRAPH]With one last look at the window Mikel turned back to the priest. [PARAGRAPH]"Thank you Literal Edain," Mikel said to the priest, "It is an honor I will give my life to uphold. "[PARAGRAPH]The priest smiled, but said nothing. [PARAGRAPH]"Is any sort of donation customary?" Mikel added quietly, embarrassed he was unaware of the protocol. [PARAGRAPH]"No my son," the priest said patting Mikel's hand. "You do a great service for our god. It is I who should be thanking you. Go and enjoy the day and your family. Though I expect to see you for morning devotions. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course eyeman . "[PARAGRAPH]The rest of the small group joined in congratulating Mikel. But Mikel found himself glancing back at the window that showed the angel with the crescent shield. After a few minutes Mikel was able to break away and ask the priest about it. [PARAGRAPH]"Literal Edain, who is the angel in the third eastern window?" Mikel asked. "The one with the crescent shield?"[PARAGRAPH]The priest stopped putting away the objects from the ceremony and looked at the window as if trying to remember. [PARAGRAPH]"I believe his name is Verchiel. Nearly sixty years ago, soon after this temple was first built, an occisor chased two children in here. A nine year old girl named Amelie and her brother, who was a few years younger. Amelie fell at the foot of the altar and prayed for help while her brother tried to fight the occisor. The boy was killed, but when the occisor went for Amelie, Verchiel protected her. The occisor fled from the temple and Amelie devoted her life to the Empyrean. "[PARAGRAPH]After a pause the priest added, "Why do you ask?"[PARAGRAPH]"The oil. . . " Mikel said clumsily, "I mean, I thought I saw that angel move during the ceremony. "[PARAGRAPH]"That is good. " Edain said, though Mikel couldn't tell if he was being patronizing or if visions like his were so common that the priest was unimpressed by it. Edain patted Mikel's arm and without saying more went back to storing the altar cloth in the small recess behind the altar. [PARAGRAPH]Deirdre approached the altar still beaming with pride at her husband. Anna followed her mother, anxious to hug her father but unsure if she was allowed to come close yet. Anna beamed up at Mikel with a smile identical to her mother's as he scooped her up in his arms. [PARAGRAPH]"My mother has a carriage ready, I think she is almost as proud of you as I am. " Deirdre whispered as she hugged Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 2[PARAGRAPH]At dawn the next morning Mikel was back at the temple. It was nearly full as the crowd went through morning devotions, alternatively sitting in quiet reflection, open prayer, and listening to Literal Edain speak. This morning Edain talked about Bridgit, the archangel of Bhall, who remained true to her goddess's mandate of divine passion even as Bhall fell to the whispers of Agares. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth sat on one side of Mikel, and Deirdre on the other. Anna sat on her mother's lap dutifully listening to the sermon, her eyes wide with wonder. She had blue ribbons in her blond hair, and in the yellow light of the temple her hair seemed to be made of gold. [PARAGRAPH]With a whispered blessing Literal Edain dismissed the congregation and almost as one the crowd rose to leave. Mikel interrupted the group funneling out to give his wife and daughter a quick kiss. [PARAGRAPH]"I will see you tonight. " Mikel whispered. Then to Ceth he added, "Can you wait for me? I want to speak to the eyeman. "[PARAGRAPH]Ceth nodded and stepped outside to get out of the way of those leaving behind him. After a hug Deirdre and her mother took Anna out into the city, already talking about their plans for the day. Mikel waited until the temple was clear before he approached Edain. [PARAGRAPH]"Eyeman, do you have a minute?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course. " Edain said sitting in the first pew and signaling Mikel to sit beside him. "What is it?"[PARAGRAPH]"It's about the mandate of truth. I have a question about when it is appropriate. "[PARAGRAPH]Edain sat passively, giving no indication if these sorts of questions were expected or unusual after someone has been through the ceremony. [PARAGRAPH]"I am a part of a lie, but it is not my secret. " Mikel said, "My mother-in-law believes I met Dierdre while working as a guard in the market, that I saved her from a thief. The truth is, we met when I caught Deirdre stealing from one of the merchants. "[PARAGRAPH]Again there was no indication if this surprised Edain or not. [PARAGRAPH]"I want to be honest with my mother-in-law, but I don't want to violate my wife's trust. What does the mandate of truth require of me? What does Lugus ask?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Edain offered a practiced smile. "The mandate of truth is a heavy burden. One that cannot be forced on any man, and must be accepted willingly. You cannot force your wife to live under its restrictions just because you do. To do so is to invite secrets between you, and the purpose of the mandate of truth is to live without secrets. "[PARAGRAPH]Edain paused before continuing. "But, you should encourage your wife to be honest in all things. This lie does not protect her, it traps her. One cannot change the past simply by saying it is not so. Speaking personally I have known AnnaSophia for many years, and I have no doubt she will have compassion for her daughter if she is told the truth. "[PARAGRAPH]"Yes eyeman. " Mikel said, "You are right. Thank you. "[PARAGRAPH]After another thanks Mikel headed out of the temple, where Ceth waited for him. They were a few blocks from the north bridge and the walk was a good way to warm up on the cold morning. [PARAGRAPH]The north bridge was unguarded during the winter. The few that crossed it were local farmers and traders, and even they were infrequent. But once the northern passes opened, activity would increase until it became one of the busiest bridges in Bourne. [PARAGRAPH]When it was built the bridge was wide enough that one of the aspen trees that grew along the rivers northern bank could have been laid across it. But since that time merchants had setup stalls on both sides of the bridge and there was barely room left for two caravans to pass. [PARAGRAPH]When Mikel and Ceth arrived the gates at both ends of the bridge were closed. Mikel unlocked each and turned to look at the empty stalls and the bridge tower. A deer stood in the woods at the north end of the bridge watching the two men. [PARAGRAPH]"Are we supposed to protect the city from the deer?" Ceth asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Laugh now, in a few weeks you will have more than enough work. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"By work you mean sitting by the tower watching caravans roll by, right?" Ceth said. [PARAGRAPH]"Right, and the occasional patrol up and down the bridge. But don't worry, we have some real work today. " Mikel said unlocking the bridge tower and opening it to stuffy room with a small jail, desk and armory. A nest of webs filled the corners of the room and the dried husks of rats hung in the webbing. [PARAGRAPH]"Today we clean. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"Then who is going to keep an eye on the deer?" Ceth said disgusted. [PARAGRAPH]The spider was nearly the size of a man's head, and both the men were glad there was no one else on the bridge to hear their screams as they chased and eventually killed it. They spent the rest of the day cleaning the tower. They accepted a small shipment of weapons and armor, stored them in the armory and then sat outside the tower and watched the river and the leafless woods beyond for the rest of the afternoon. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 3[PARAGRAPH]Just as Mikel promised, within a few weeks the bridge was alive with activity. All of the stalls were open with merchants hawking their wares to passing caravans, and it was rare to have a moment without at least one caravan on the bridge. The woods on the north bank were now green, the days were warmer and Mikel had ten guards, including his lieutenant Ceth, assigned to the north bridge and reporting to him. [PARAGRAPH]"Come down off my wagons!"[PARAGRAPH]The scream was angry, though it was easily lost in the chaos of people arguing over the price of goods, yelling for people to move out of the way of wagons and the sounds of various mules, oxen and chickens scattered over the bridge. [PARAGRAPH]"Guardsman!" an angry merchant yelled, looking at Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]"Captain," Mikel corrected, "and what can I do for you?"[PARAGRAPH]"There is a man, a thief, rooting through my goods. " the merchant exclaimed. He was a large man and his face was bright red with anger. He looked to be about to climb up onto the wagon where a wiry man poked beneath the tarps that covered it, if he could manage to lift his bulk up off the road, which didn't seem likely. [PARAGRAPH]"Greylin," Mikel called, "get off the wagon. I've warned you about this before. "[PARAGRAPH]"Mikel, tell him I'm no thief. I'm just checking to see what he has for sale. " Then turning to the red faced merchant Greylin added, "How much do you want for these radishes? I could take the whole batch off your hands. "[PARAGRAPH]Cutting off the merchant before he started to scream again, Mikel said "Now Greylin, or it's a night in the cell. "[PARAGRAPH]With a look of disappointment Greylin climbed down. "The real thieves are in the market, they won't pay anything for these goods. They don't offer fair deals to outsiders. Not like me, I respect a man who traveled all the way to Bourne. You don't have to be my cousin's sister's whatever to get a fair deal from me. "[PARAGRAPH]"Greylin is harmless. " Mikel said to the merchant whose face was returning to a normal color, "And he isn't a thief, though he is overeager. You won't have any more problems with him. " Mikel said this last point loud enough that Greylin could hear him. [PARAGRAPH]After making sure the merchant wasn't going to attack Greylin, Mikel headed back and sat down outside the guard tower beside Ceth. The two rarely had a chance to work together since Ceth was the bridge lieutenant and in charge of the bridge during shifts Mikel wasn't working. [PARAGRAPH]"Is it any better at night?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"It's not this crowded. But it's steady until dusk, then we get a rush of activity as people try to get into or out of the city. We never get the gates closed on time. " then Ceth added, "I was going to ask Donovan if he could work tonight. Fenton is sick, covered with boils if his wife is to be believed, and I'm down a man. "[PARAGRAPH]"Donovan is sick too, sounds like he may have the same thing. We only have three men on the bridge today. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"Think they may be all off drinking somewhere?" Ceth said half-joking. [PARAGRAPH]"I saw Donovan. " Mikel said, "He looked horrible. A bunch of people in the city have been getting sick, most get better in a few days. I can cover for Fenton, maybe I can talk Deirdre into bringing us some dinner. "[PARAGRAPH]"Are you sure? I can ask someone else. " Ceth said. [PARAGRAPH]"It's no problem, but you have to pay me back by sticking around and covering Donovan's shift for the rest of the day. "[PARAGRAPH]The rest of the day went smoothly. Just as Ceth described there was a rush of activity just before the gates closed and by the time the dusk bells rang throughout Bourne the gates were all still open. Finally a little more than an hour later they were closed and locked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel locked the guard tower and met Ceth for a final walk down to check in with the overnight guards on the north side of the bridge. Walking down they were surprised to see three figures walking toward them. It was too dark to see clearly but it looked to be a woman flanked by two men. One of the men was a bear of a man, thick through the chest and shoulders. He plodded forward with all the grace of a boulder rolling down hill. The other man was the opposite, he was almost lost in the silhouette of his cloak. A slight turn and this man stepped into the shadows of one of the merchant stalls and disappeared. [PARAGRAPH]"Halt. " Ceth called lifting his spear. The two figures they could still see continued walking forward as if they hadn't heard him. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel's hand went instinctively to his sword hilt. Something about these people worried him. The gate guards wouldn't allow anyone on the bridge after closing. And the way one of the companions disappeared spoke to a skill beyond simple travelers. Mikel hadn't even drawn his sword other than to care for it since being assigned to the bridge. He had used his sap a few times and sometimes threatened to use a short cudgel he carried. But this was the first time he was tempted to draw his sword. A blue ribbon tied around the swords hilt reminded him to stay calm. [PARAGRAPH]"Careful," Mikel whispered to Ceth, "there were three of them. "[PARAGRAPH]They were now close enough to see each other. The woman was the most notable, with pale alabaster skin that made her look almost ghostlike in the moonlight. She wore burgundy robes so dark Mikel first mistook them for black, her hair was long and black and her eyes were dark pools. She was beautiful, as long as you avoided her eyes, which were cold and empty. [PARAGRAPH]Her bearlike companion wore a horsehair cloak and worn leather armor. He held a thick double bladed axe casually in his hand, it dripped with a dark liquid. Mikel could see the swirl of black tatoo's sticking out from beneath his leather bracers. [PARAGRAPH]"Sheaim!" Mikel yelled, hand going to his sword. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth lowered his spear, pointing it threateningly at the woman as he stepped towards her. She ignored him, throwing her head back as if to howl. But instead of making any noise Mikel felt a sudden pressure on his ears and head that was so strong it made him dizzy. Not only did the woman make no noise, everything went perfectly silent. The sound of the wind blowing across the tarps over merchant stalls disappeared, the sounds of the river lapping against the bridges foundations was gone, only perfect empty silence remained. [PARAGRAPH]It was silent as the man with the double bladed axe walked towards Mikel. Silent as Ceth approached the woman. Ceth shook his head and looked at Mikel in confusion, whatever was affecting Mikel was affecting him as well. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel drew his sword in time to parry the axeman's attack. He could now see that the liquid on the axe was fresh blood, and he had little doubt it was from the overnight guards. This axeman could have been any of the kids that grew up in the orphanage with him. He had the same copper colored skin, and the same delight on his face at the opportunity to cause pain. [PARAGRAPH]But Mikel was not a simple guardsman grown soft settling disputes between merchants. With force the axeman wasn't expecting Mikel parried the axe and brought an armored elbow up hard against the side of the axeman's face. Suddenly the look of delight was gone, replaced by anger. [PARAGRAPH]The cloaked man that had slipped into the shadows came out. He stepped between Ceth and the woman, and when Ceth lunged with his spear he leapt up and landed easily on the end of Ceth's spear. [PARAGRAPH]There he stood, almost frozen, an axe in each hand and seemingly without affecting the weight of spear at all. Ceth stood unbelieving. First the silence and now this man stood on the tip of his spear as if balancing on a tightrope. The scene had an eerie dreamlike quality. [PARAGRAPH]Meanwhile the axeman Mikel was fighting continued to swing wildly. Mikel drew his cudgel in his left hand and it was quickly destroyed by the powerful axe. Another parry and an elbow to the axeman's face sent the axeman stumbling backwards, cursing soundlessly. Mikel didn't waste the opportunity and stabbed the axeman's exposed side, just below his kidney and through until stopped by the leather plate on the axeman's back. The axeman stumbled back further and fell, a dark pool quickly welled around the wound. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth tried to shake his spear, to knock off the man standing on it. But instead the man ran up the length of the spear. Coming up nearly to Ceth's hand the attacker swung his twin axes, catching Ceth's throat and sending a bright red arch of blood high into the air, some even struck Mikel, though he was over three meters away. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth went back, head down hard into the stone bridge. He dropped the spear and the man nimbly landed on the ground, turning toward Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]The woman stopped her silent howl and sound returned with another dizzying pop of pressure. [PARAGRAPH]"Leave him, run. " the woman said pointing toward the south end of the bridge. Together the two started running toward the city. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel fell at Ceth's side, ignoring the fleeing attackers and the axeman lying wounded on the bridge. Ceth's eyes were spinning wildly in fear and confusion, but they stopped when they locked onto Mikel's. He tried to speak but that only caused more blood to spill out of his open throat. Mikel clasped both hands over Ceth's throat, trying in vain to stop the bleeding, though blood continued to pour through his fingers. [PARAGRAPH]"Please, please, please. " Mikel whispered, trying to contain the horror rushing through him. A deep breath and his thoughts focused, his fear was gone. [PARAGRAPH]"Please, Lugus, lord of the dawn, do not forget us. " Mikel whispered, "Do not let him die. He has seen too few days. Share your mercy and your light with him. "[PARAGRAPH]There was a sudden heat through Mikel's fingers and he felt Ceth gasp. Opening his eyes Mikel saw Verchiel, the angel in the temple, kneeling on the other side of Ceth, mirroring Mikel's pose. Verchiel was praying too, and where the angel's hands passed through Mikel's he felt heat and power. [PARAGRAPH]Any shock or surprise was gone in this moment. Mikel only cared about saving Ceth and did not question the appearance of the glowing angel. Verchiel appeared much like a stained glass window, his skin was golden and slightly translucent and an inner light seemed to radiate from him. He wore modest white robes trimmed in yellow and he had the same crescent shaped bronze shield decorated with beautifully faceted gemstones. [PARAGRAPH]As the warmth faded Verchiel looked up into Mikel's face. "There is a sickness within Bourne. If you have faith we can heal the city. "[PARAGRAPH]"I do, I will. " said Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]At that Verchiel spread his wings, appearing exactly as he did in the window, and disappeared. [PARAGRAPH]"Mikel," Ceth said straining through Mikel's pressure on his throat, "what happened?"[PARAGRAPH]Mikel removed his hands to see two long scars on Ceth's throat. They were thick and bright red, but completely closed and the skin around the wounds looked fresh and healthy. [PARAGRAPH]"The angel healed you. " Mikel said, though he realized how strange those words sounded. [PARAGRAPH]Both men were broken out of their thoughts by the sound of the axeman Mikel had stabbed trying to get up. The axeman grabbed his side, weak from the loss of blood. Despite his obvious pain he was already standing and he raised his axe menacingly. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel rolled up and charged the axeman. Mikel's sword knocked the axe easily aside and Mikel set his shoulder low and into the axeman's chest. The axeman flew backwards, losing hold of his axe as he slammed into the side of a merchant stall and then fell hard against the ground. This time nothing silenced him and his cries were loud and profane. [PARAGRAPH]"I'll take care of him. " Ceth said picking himself up and grabbing his cudgel. [PARAGRAPH]"Are you sure you are okay?" Mikel said, but Ceth moved quickly, rolling the cursing axeman over and tying his hands. Despite the stains of blood on his neck, face and breastplate Ceth was completely recovered from the attack. [PARAGRAPH]"I'm going to warn the city guard, put him in the cell. " Mikel said. Then, without waiting for Ceth's answer, Mikel ran south along the bridge, chasing after the woman and the other attacker. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 4[PARAGRAPH]Mikel couldn't help feeling negligent in missing the next morning's dawn ceremony. As the morning bells rang out through the city he was sitting in a very crowded north bridge tower. Ceth was here as was Mikel's senior officer, Knight Commander Marlowe, and a crowd of other officers and priests. [PARAGRAPH]One of these priests was questioning the axeman, who gave his name as Cain the Torn, and who remained locked in the towers single cell. Mikel listened to the questioning as he and Ceth recounted their memories of the attack. [PARAGRAPH]"Cain, do you think your companions could have overcome the guard captain on their own?" the priest asked the prisoner. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes. " Cain answered. [PARAGRAPH]"Then why would you protect them if they abandoned you so easily? You would be dead if not for our care, left to die or be arrested while they escaped. There are two dead guardsmen, and nearly a third but for the grace of Lugus. Would you bear the burden for these crimes alone?"[PARAGRAPH]Cain didn't answer. He was still pale from the loss of blood and leaned against the cell wall. It was obvious the priest's persistent questions were having some impact on him. Seeing Cain wasn't going to respond the priest tried a different tact. [PARAGRAPH]"Cain, do you have a family. A wife and children?"[PARAGRAPH]"I did. " Cain answered, "I was much worse then. I lost control and killed them. "[PARAGRAPH]Cain seemed to be lost in the memory of the event. His answer quieted the rest of the people in the room, but the priest continued undeterred. [PARAGRAPH]"It is good you admit that. You would not want to die with that burden upon you. You can be forgiven, you can find peace. But this woman, she wanted you to continue killing, to use you. "[PARAGRAPH]"She. . . " Cain said looking up at the people in the room, "knows who I really am. "[PARAGRAPH]"It is not who you have to be. " the priest continued, "Your wife, she saw a different man. She knew who you really are. "[PARAGRAPH]"No," Cain said with emotion, "not until the night I killed her. That was the first time she really saw me. "[PARAGRAPH]The priest continued questioning but Cain didn't offer any further information, and nothing about his companions. Forgiveness and repentance may appeal to those raised in Bourne, but Mikel wasn't surprised the Sheaimic axeman was uninterested in the concepts. [PARAGRAPH]"This is a miracle. " Knight Commander Marlowe said placing his hand on Mikel's shoulder. "A vision, a warning and the life of one of our guardsman saved. This is a blessing not only to you but the city itself. It is an honor that Lugus would intervene. "[PARAGRAPH]"Yes sir. " Mikel said, "I feel like I should be at the dawn ceremony now, or out looking for the woman and the other man. "[PARAGRAPH]"A soldier always wants to be doing. But you are a part of the city, and without moving you are accomplishing both. Runners have been sent to all of the temples and guard stations in Bourne. The guards are all looking for them, and thanks are being offered in all the temples. " Marlowe answered. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel was surprised, he knew the runners had been sent to the guard stations, he had started that process last night. But knowing the priests were being told about his vision made him self-conscious. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth had it even worse. The priests were taking turns investigating the scars on his neck and treating him like a sacred relic. He had been choking on blood until, as if waking from a bad dream, the pain was gone. He thought he was dead except for the flood of cool night air in his lungs. Ceth hadn't seen the angel or known about it until Mikel told him. [PARAGRAPH]"Tomorrow why don't you and Ceth come to the dawn ritual at the Cathedral of Bells ? I am sure Luminary Rimmon would like to meet you. "[PARAGRAPH]"It would be an honor. " Mikel said, though the prospect of meeting the high priest of Bourne made him more nervous than the fight on the bridge. [PARAGRAPH]Ceth agreed to the invitation and the two stayed long enough to sign Cain over to the city guard, who would transport him to city prison. After stopping to give instruction to the day watch, Mikel set off for Dierdre's mother's manor. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel had sent a runner to Dierdre less than an hour after the fight, giving her a short explanation of what had happened and asking her to go to her mother's house to be safe. Mikel had ordered the runner to escort her to her mother's house. [PARAGRAPH]Dierdre's father had been a knight commander in charge of a thousand men. He died on the battlefield, giving his life for Lugus and Bourne in the autumn just after Dierdre's eighth birthday. Before he died he built the squat stone manor, now called Wyn Manor. [PARAGRAPH]The manor had four wings, but since Dierdre's mother AnnaSophia lived in it alone only the east wing remained open. Dierdre met Mikel as he entered the kitchen door the family most commonly used. AnnaSophia was in the kitchen behind her daughter pouring tea. Anna, who had tried to wait up for her father's return, had finally succumbed to sleep and was lost in a tangle of blankets on a couch in the adjoining great room. [PARAGRAPH]"What happened?" Dierdre said, unaccustomed to any change in the normal guard schedule. [PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia, whose marriage contained many mornings like this shooed her daughter away from the door and offered Mikel a seat at the kitchen table, which he gladly dropped into. Mikel didn't have time to speak before a cup of hot tea was placed before him, along with some dry rolls and a small pot of butter. [PARAGRAPH]"Thank you," Mikel mumbled as he ripped off a piece of bread and stuffed it in his mouth. [PARAGRAPH]Noticing Mikel was still covered with sweat and the spray of blood AnnaSophia went to wet a rag for him to clean off with. Before she could do so Dierdre also noticed the dried blood splattered line across his breastplate. [PARAGRAPH]"Is that blood?" Dierdre asked, her voice rising. [PARAGRAPH]"Quiet Diery. " AnnaSophia said, indicating where Anna slept. "Let Mikel eat a bit first, he is here and safe. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel quickly finished eating and washed the blood off his armor while he told both of the women what happened. Dierdre was stunned by Mikel's description of the angel and Ceth's healing, but AnnaSophia only listened carefully and waited until the story was complete to ask her question. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you tell anyone about your vision?" AnnaSophia asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes, of course, I told Knight Commander Marlowe and it was relayed to the guard stations and to the temples before dawn. "[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia's looked down, her brow furrowed, seemingly intent on the crumbs she was sweeping off the counter. [PARAGRAPH]"Do you think I shouldn't have?" Mikel asked. "Do you think I didn't really see an angel?"[PARAGRAPH]"I think you saw an angel. " AnnaSophia said quickly, "But I wonder how the church will accept your miracle and vision. These are rare events, it may be years before we hear of anything similar. What will the church expect of you because of it?"[PARAGRAPH]"They will know he is a hero. That the church did well to make him a captain. " Dierdre answered. [PARAGRAPH]"I am sure you are right. " AnnaSophia said, but she continued brushing off the counter though no crumbs remained. [PARAGRAPH]They talked for a few more minutes before Mikel's exhaustion began to catch up with him. After asking if he could borrow one of the guest bedrooms Mikel picked the sleeping Anna up off the couch and carried her into the bedroom where he placed her gently on the bed before collapsing beside her. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel's dreams where thick and muddy. The fight on the bridge mixed with those from his boyhood in Galveholm. He dreamt about Cain killing his wife and Herod Wyn, a man he had never met, who died in the service of Lugus leaving his wife widowed and his daughter fatherless. And though he searched in his dreams for another vision of the angel, it never came. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 5[PARAGRAPH]The noon bells woke Mikel. It had only been a few hours sleep, but it would have to be enough. He washed up before putting his armor back on. As he was putting his sword belt on he noticed his sword was still stained with Cain's blood. He took the sword out and cleaned it. [PARAGRAPH]The blood had even stained the blue ribbon tied around its hilt. Mikel felt suddenly angry he had been forced into a fight on the bridge, that they had attacked him and killed the other guards. That an angel had intervened and spoken with him, and that Ceth had been injured in the first place. He had hoped his days of sword fights were past. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel kissed Anna, who still lay sleeping peacefully on the bed, and headed down to the great room. [PARAGRAPH]Dierdre had taken her daughter's position on the couch and was snoring softly. AnnaSophia was still in the kitchen, though she peeked in when she heard Mikel before going back to her work. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel walked into the kitchen and saw she was packing a half loaf of bread, a bag of almonds and a fresh canteen. She set it out for him as Mikel entered the room. [PARAGRAPH]"Does this mean I'm leaving?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"If you stay I'll gladly cook you something better. But I don't think your coming downstairs for my cooking. " she answered. [PARAGRAPH]"No, you are right. " Mikel pocketed the food and the canteen then added, "Thank you for your help this morning. I was, I still am, overwhelmed. When Dierdre wakes up could you tell her to wait here for me and I'll come back tonight to walk her home. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course. " AnnaSophia said. [PARAGRAPH]With that Mikel headed out into the city on a walk to the city prison. It was a fair walk from Wyn Manor and he was glad to have the bread and almonds to snack on while he walked. [PARAGRAPH]Bourne was set in a series of low hills between the Fellin river, which the north bridge crossed, and the much larger Arduro straight to the south. The straight was too large for a bridge so the south side of Bourne was dominated by docks and warehouses. To protect the city from flooding a levee was built among the docks with a series of maze like sewer tunnels beneath. Since its construction the building has since been turned into the city prison, though it still goes by its original name, the Drain. [PARAGRAPH]A wall now surrounded the Drain and provided some protection from flood waters but Mikel felt nervous each time he entered the prison. [PARAGRAPH]"Afternoon captain. " a guard said as Mikel approached. Still fairly new to his role Mikel was surprised to see the respect accorded him by junior guards. And the few guarding the prison seemed even more impressed as they stood formally and one unlocked the outside gate to let him in. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel headed through the gate and down the gradually sloping stone staircase. Lamps were set in the walls, and though the staircase was clean and dry, moisture beaded on the walls. [PARAGRAPH]At the end the stairwell opened to the prisons main processing room. Almost a dozen guards worked here and four main shafts lead out to the converted cells. [PARAGRAPH]"Are you captain Alaunus?" a guard asked. He was sitting at a desk beside a woman draped in a cranberry shawl. [PARAGRAPH]At the mention of his name many of the guards, who had been talking to each other or filling out papers, stopped working and looked up. But the woman didn't turn. She sat facing the guard that had called for him, with her back to Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes I am. " Mikel said crossing the room to the guard's desk, "I was hoping to speak with Cain. I have a few questions about his purpose here in Bourne. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course captain. " the guard said. "He is in tunnel C. But we may have a witness that saw the woman who was traveling with Cain last night. " The guard indicated the woman sitting at his desk. [PARAGRAPH]The woman looked to be both frail and fierce. Her shawl was gathered tightly about her in the cool dungeon. The hands grasping at it were gaunt, little more than skin worn thin by years pulled over gnarled bone. But her clear grey eyes refused to admit weakness. She was angry, or annoyed, or her scowl was permanently fixed on her face. It was not a face accustomed to smiling. [PARAGRAPH]"Hello ma'am. " Mikel said. "I'm captain Mikel Alaunus of the north bridge. I fought with the woman and her guards last night. They killed two of my men. Can you describe the woman you saw?"[PARAGRAPH]The woman didn't answer, she just stared at Mikel in a way that made him feel guilty, though he wasn't sure what for. The guard broke the silence, reading from his notes. [PARAGRAPH]"Fisher Lizabeth Konal," the guard started, once again indicating the woman, "said her son was at the Sparrow last night being chatted up by young foreign lady who matched the description of the woman on the bridge. Pretty, with dark hair and cloak that was so dark red it was nearly black. She said any man in the bar would have been happy to pay for her, and didn't know why she would be wasting her time on her dullard of a son. "[PARAGRAPH]Seeing Mikel's look of surprise the guard quickly added, "That's from her description, not from me captain. "[PARAGRAPH]"Did you see her closely?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes, I went in to yell at my son. " Lizabeth answered, "To get him to the docks to work a shift but he was rooted to the bar stool as usual. That witch glared at me. I've seen more warmth in a corpse's eyes. " Her voice was a thin rasp entirely suited for her angry face. [PARAGRAPH]"Can we speak to your son?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"If you can find him. He's been missing since last night. " she answered. [PARAGRAPH]"We already have two men out looking for him and a patrol out searching the area around the Sparrow. " the guard added quickly. [PARAGRAPH]"Why would she want to talk to your son?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"No idea. The boy is as useless as a painting to a blind man. " she said. [PARAGRAPH]The old woman didn't seem willing to offer anything further. [PARAGRAPH]"Any thoughts soldier?" Mikel asked the guard. [PARAGRAPH]"No captain. By all accounts Anton Konal, that's her son, was a large man. Maybe a good six to nine inches taller than you. He was a guard for a brief time a few years ago but rarely reported to his shift and was let go. Now he spends his time drinking in the Sparrow, passed out on its floor or working as a dock hand. Fisher Konal's assessment of her son seems accurate. It's unlikely he is a secret Sheaim contact in the city, or of any real use to anyone. "[PARAGRAPH]Then, as if forgetting he was speaking in front of Anton's mother the guard added, "Sorry ma'am". [PARAGRAPH]"All true," she said. [PARAGRAPH]"It does sound like her. " Mikel said, "I will ask Cain about it. Soldier, if the patrol turns anything up would you let me know? I will be stationed at the north bridge tonight. "[PARAGRAPH]"Of course captain. " the guard replied. [PARAGRAPH]After thanking Fisher Konal, Mikel headed down into Tunnel C. Mikel walked passed rows of cells, some empty and others filled with a mix of pickpockets, prostitutes and drunkards. After walking to the end of the first row and down a spiral staircase, Cain's cell became obvious. There was a small group of people standing outside it. [PARAGRAPH]Two guards stood silent watch outside the cell, another pair was inside. There was a man in an orange waistcoat who Mikel recognized as a local speaker, and a Literal with pale yellow robes was tending to a small brazier that was burning incense. Lastly captain Cerron, the head of the prison stood looking into the cell. Cerron noticed Mikel approaching. [PARAGRAPH]"Captain Alunus, welcome to the Drain. I'm sorry I haven't had a chance to make it out to the north bridge and congratulate you on your promotion yet. " Captain Cerron said. [PARAGRAPH]"Thank you captain," Mikel replied, "I know you are busy and it's only a matter of time before all the sentry captains get to meet with you. I am only sorry we couldn't be meeting over a less tragic incident. "[PARAGRAPH]"Yes, this one is a mystery. And I'm sorry to hear about your men. My son trained with soldier Ruen, he was a good man. " Cerron said. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes he was. " Mikel said. "How is the interrogation going?"[PARAGRAPH]"We haven't gotten much out of him. " Cerron answered. "He claims he and his companions were cutting through Bourne on their way to Galveholm and he doubts either of them are still in Bourne. He says the woman's name is Gosea and the other man's name was Mahon. The Literal is preparing for the kiss of the innocent so we know if he is lying or not. "[PARAGRAPH]"Do you mind if I ask him a few questions?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Captain Cerron checked with the speaker and the Literal, neither of which had any objection. [PARAGRAPH]"But I will need your weapons before you enter the cell. Just in case. " Cerron said. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel removed his sword belt and handed it to the captain. Then one of the guards unlocked the cell as the others stood ready for Cain to move. But Cain sat on a bench in the back of the cell with his head down and his curly hair hanging in front of his face. He didn't look up even as Mikel entered the cell, crossed it and sat down beside him. [PARAGRAPH]The two men were similar in size with deep coppery skin. They both had black hair and similar tattoos across their chest, back and arms. The connection was not lost on Mikel who was so accustomed to looking different that sitting by a man that could have been his brother was unsettling. [PARAGRAPH]"Have they told you about the kiss of the innocent?" Mikel began. With no sound from Cain he continued, "They heat a coal on the brazier, then pray over it. When their prayers are complete they will put it in your mouth. If you have been honest the coal will not burn you. If you have lied, then it will burn your mouth and tongue so badly you will never speak again. "[PARAGRAPH]"Do you believe that?" Cain asked, his head still down. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel was surprised by the question. He knew many questioned the impact of the gods in the world, but this was a man who traveled with a witch who could drink the sound out of an area and another who could stand on the end of a spear without adding any weight to it. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course I do. I have seen it performed many times. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"I've have some experience with torture. This technique is also used among the Sheaim but without the religious trappings. I think it originally came from the Bannor. It works because a lying man is more nervous, his mouth goes dry and the coal burns him. An innocent man has more moisture in his mouth so he isn't burned. That's assuming the coal is prepared at the right temperature. If it is too hot anyone will be burned by it. I suspect your preparation ritual is all about getting it to the correct temperature, at least I hope it is. " Cain said, finally looking up at where the Literal was still praying over the brazier. [PARAGRAPH]"Have you been honest?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Why wouldn't I be? The worst I've done you already know. I killed a couple of your men. I assume you are going to kill me for it. Why lie?"[PARAGRAPH]"Do you know where your companions are now?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Cain ignored the question. Looking at Mikel he asked, "Why did you become a rooster?"[PARAGRAPH]"I fled Galveholm because I was on the losing side of one of the street wars. I ended up here by accident, but I liked it. It was a better life and they are good people. Lugus revealed himself to me and allowed me to become something more than the thug and murderer I was. " Mikel answered. "In fact, that night on the bridge I saw an angel. It healed my lieutenant and told me there was a disease in Bourne I was to help cleanse. But it didn't tell me how. "[PARAGRAPH]"Why do you suppose the gods never tell us the whole story?" Cain asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I think it's because your friends are the disease and you know where they are. So I already have everything I need. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"You are wrong, I have no idea where they are. Probably halfway to Galveholm. I think the gods don't tell us the full story because if we knew how things were going to turn out, we would never follow them. " Cain said. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel considered Cain quietly. He didn't believe Cain was lying, but Mikel had been softened by years living in Bourne. People here were horrible liars, they became nervous and talkative. Among the Sheaim many had no guilt lying or killing, and they talked emotionlessly about both. [PARAGRAPH]"Your friend lived?" Cain asked. [PARAGRAPH]"My lieutenant, yes. The angel healed him. " Mikel answered. [PARAGRAPH]"Mahon isn't going to be happy about that. He likes to claim anytime he swings his axes, someone dies. As far as I know it has always been true. "[PARAGRAPH]"Do you think he will stay in Bourne long enough to kill Ceth?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"No, he will do what Gosea wants. And she is too practical to care about Mahon's streak or a guard that got away. " Cain said. [PARAGRAPH]"Any idea why Gosea was at a bar last night chatting up a local dock hand?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]For the first time Cain looked surprised. When Mikel asked again Cain denied knowing why she would be there, and this time Mikel was sure he was lying. Despite Mikel's attempts to get any more information Cain wouldn't talk. Hearing about the bar visit had scared him, or reinforced his loyalty. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel stayed long enough to watch the Literal place the coal in Cain's mouth. Though Cain attempted to take it willingly, to get the test over with quickly, his fear overcame him at the last second and he had to be restrained by the guards and the coal forced into his mouth. [PARAGRAPH]Cain was uninjured by the coal beyond some minor burns. It was enough for the Literal to proclaim he had been honest in all his answers. Mikel doubted that was the case. [PARAGRAPH]But it was getting close to time for the night shift. Though he felt like he hadn't gained any usable information Mikel thanked captain Cerron and headed out of the Drain on the long walk to the north bridge. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 6[PARAGRAPH]Anton Konal had been burning for nearly twenty hours. [PARAGRAPH]It hadn't been hard to lure him to the empty silo, he followed Gosea without complaint. Even though he towered over the petite witch, he hadn't tried to force himself on her. Instead he begged and offered clumsy compliments in an attempt to seduce her. Gosea was disgusted by him. [PARAGRAPH]The hard part was finding a place for the sacrifice. Since it was early spring many of the silos along the docks were empty, and Mahon found one large enough to construct what they needed without anyone seeing the fire. Gosea's magic would take care of the screams. [PARAGRAPH]Once Anton arrived Mahon tied him to the large post in the center of the empty silo. Anton was forced atop a pile of refuse from the docks, splintered crates and barrels, planks and rope. All were coated with lamp oil. [PARAGRAPH]Gosea lit the flames and they stood in perfect silence as Anton writhed in pain. The fire consumed his feet then up along his legs. His skin peeled and blackened, revealing thick layers of fat beneath that burned and melted like candle wax. There was so much fat on him that hot, liquid streams of it crawled down his legs and dripped hissing into the fire. [PARAGRAPH]In time he stopped screaming, but Gosea's magic wouldn't let him die. His voice was gone and the flames had eaten away all the unnecessary parts of him. Anton's massive frame, blackened and burnt, was little more than bones covered with thick muscle. [PARAGRAPH]That was when the ritual changed. Instead of being consumed by the fire Anton's body began consuming it. Mahon poured more lamp oil on the fire until the flames were as high as Anton's waist but Anton seemed empowered by it. The fire greedily licked at Anton's chest, arms and shoulders. It was absorbed and drawn into him. And over time a hot orange glow came from within his chest, and behind his eyes. [PARAGRAPH]There he stood, eyes fixed on Gosea in passive supplication. He was no longer alive, but unable to die. His most basic animalistic desires were tethered to his body by Gosea's spell. When the ritual was done Mahon cut him free and what had been Anton lumbered off the pyre, ready to receive Gosea's commands. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 7[PARAGRAPH]The midnight bells rang through the city. Dawn and noon were sacred times in Bourne, even dusk was seen as a time of reflection and rest. But there was little comfort in midnight. In the well ordered city this was the one time when strange things happened. And it was when the two guards standing attention at the Drain's outer gate spotted Anton Konal's corpse lumbering toward them. [PARAGRAPH]A cloak had been placed over him, but it was nearly burnt off. His body glowed like a coal, his skin and muscles were charred and black, but beneath the guards could see slivers of orange fire. Though the body lumbering toward them was on fire it was more terrifying that the flames didn't seem to bother it. [PARAGRAPH]The guards yelled for help before grabbing their spears. Neither had any desire to get close to the creature. [PARAGRAPH]They waited until they heard other guards running up the stairs out of the Drain before attacking. One stabbed Anton's corpse, and the creature made no attempt to avoid the spear. It punctured Anton's large chest and slid easily through. Anton hurried forward, up along the spear and grabbed the startled guard. His thick hands closed on the guards throats and the guards strangled screams were mixed with the pain of burning hands on his skin. [PARAGRAPH]"Shields men!" captain Cerron called, racing up the stairs behind his soldiers. "Do not waste yourself on lethal attacks, the creature has no vulnerable organs. Lop off any piece that gets close to you. "[PARAGRAPH]Following their orders the guards with shields readied them and closed with short blades and axes. Anton turned and the spear that was still stuck through him spun wildly, but when Anton reached for another soldier he was blocked by a shield. One guard sliced across Anton's back with a sword, and another, with a lucky blow from his axe, severed Anton's hand. [PARAGRAPH]Anton roared in anger. The places where he had been struck burned with an angry orange light. [PARAGRAPH]"Be patient men, we will bring this creature down. " Cerron called, readying his own shield as Anton's attention turned to him. [PARAGRAPH]Anton charged, and though two guards stabbed him with spears he ignored both attacks. One guard was whipped around by the force of the charging giant, the other spear snapped in half. [PARAGRAPH]Cerron dove toward the creature's left side. Though Anton had no hand on that arm he beat it furiously against the captain's shield like a giant club. Cerron deflected the attack and returned his own, ducking low and chopping into Anton's knee with his axe. [PARAGRAPH]Despite the lack of pain, or the need for lungs, heart or mind even the walking dead still need their knees. As the kneecap splintered Anton fell onto the street. [PARAGRAPH]The guards were quick to take advantage of the fall. Cerron spun to deliver another blow to the back of Anton's leg, nearly amputating it entirely. A flurry of other attacks rained down on the creature's body, each leaving an angry hot scar in its place. [PARAGRAPH]Anton shuddered and then his body exploded. With a final howl the flames were released from the prison of his burnt corpse and they swept out over the guards, the Drain front gate, and the surrounding buildings. The cobblestones burnt and fractured in the heat, the bodies of the soldiers did much worse. Helmets were melted to flesh, exposed skin was burnt down to bone. Cerron and his men were killed. [PARAGRAPH]There were only two guards left in the Drain, and they fell easily to Mahon's twin axes. [PARAGRAPH]"Split up and find Cain. " Gosea ordered, throwing Mahon the set of keys from one of the guards. "Let out anyone you find along the way. "[PARAGRAPH]Cain heard the explosion and knew what it was. By the time Gosea found his cell he was standing at the bars calling for her. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you tell them about the heartstone?" Gosea whispered as she unlocked his cell. [PARAGRAPH]"No, and they didn't ask about it. " Cain replied. "They just wanted to know where you were. I honestly told them I believed you would be halfway to Galveholm. "[PARAGRAPH]Gosea studied his face with eyes that revealed none of her thoughts. Then she handed Cain an axe she had taken from one of the guard's corpses. [PARAGRAPH]"Let us go. We don't have much time. " Gosea said. [PARAGRAPH]On the way up to the main processing room Cain saw that most of the cells were open and the prisoners had fled out into the city. Outside of one cell where the body of a prisoner lay dead on the floor. Cain guessed the excitement at his freedom had caused the man to try to take liberties with his beautiful rescuer. He hadn't even touched Gosea before she had killed him for it. [PARAGRAPH]They called for Mahon from the processing room and he ran up to meet them. Any prisoners that weren't released yet were left in their cells. Together the three fled up into the city. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 8[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stood floating above the high white walls of Bourne as dawn struck the great city. Once an angel had stood at each tower, divine guardians of this sacred city. The moniker Bourne the Gleaming was not due to the white walls, but the holy power that once permeated it. [PARAGRAPH]But that was centuries ago. In time, and across generations, the city had faded. The compact only allowed the gods, and their agents, to act when empowered by mortal faith. And there was little of that left in Bourne. [PARAGRAPH]As an angel of the god of revelation Verchiel stood silent witness to the triumphs and failures of the city, though there was little he could do to help, guide or protect its people. But each morning he prayed that it would get better, that through their faith he would be able to stand with them, that he could do more than watch them in pain. [PARAGRAPH]As Verchiel looked over the grey city the sun began to creep over its walls and light up the few citizens that had got an early start on the day. A baker plodded along the alleyway, yawning as he went. A young man rushed home, still swaying clumsily from the night before. [PARAGRAPH]From the heart of the city the cathedral bells rang and people headed to service. Born by the light streaming across the city Verchiel arched across the sky and as it struck the golden symbol of the Empyrean on the great Cathedral window Verchiel was there beside it. [PARAGRAPH]Inside parishioners talked in the muted tones of morning. Luminary Rimmon prepared himself for the morning service, thinking through the news of the attack and the way to calm the city before everyone learned about the prison breakin and the deaths of the guards. The Luminary was a decent man, more pragmatic than philosophical, more politician than priest. And though Verchiel had tried to go to him many times, the Luminary was unable to see or hear the angel. [PARAGRAPH]As the service started there was a flash of light from within the city, east of the cathedral. Not the light of fire or anything physical, but the outpouring of faith, of the true power of Lugus, the god of the Sun. [PARAGRAPH]It is hard to surprise an angel that has been with the world since the sun first shone upon it. But Verchiel was, for a long moment, stunned. Then, cautiously, he swept down from his perch on the cathedral and flew over the streets of Bourne. The people seemed unaware of the welling power, they opened their stands, brushed off their walks, or hurried to work as Verchiel swept over them. Until he found himself over a small plaza near the docs. Warehouses were on all sides, and this was typically used as a place for traders to meet and work out deals with the various ships docked nearby. But there were no new ships in yet today and the plaza was deserted. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel could feel the power here, it strengthened him and he noticed that, much like the city, he had faded as well. But the source of the power wasn't here in the plaza, it was under it. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel slipped down through the cobblestones and dirt and into the city sewers. He had rarely seen them before, it was rare that men of faith would have a reason to be in such dark corners. [PARAGRAPH]A symbol of the Empyrean was traced in gold on the smooth stone of the sewer platform. Light poured through it like a beacon and lit the chamber, sending light into places untouched by it for centuries. In the distance rats squeaked in frustration as they fled the area, and quieter predators slipped into the murky channels nearby and disappeared. [PARAGRAPH]On the other side of the sewer platform there was another rune, this one made of silver and inside it sat a woman with dark, empty eyes and skin that has never felt the touch of sunlight. [PARAGRAPH]She began talking while Verchiel looked around. She was looking right at him, though Verchiel couldn't hear her words. Behind her two men slept, seemingly unaware of what was happening, and she hadn't thought to protect them with the circle she used around herself. [PARAGRAPH]"Deceit and manipulation are as unknown to me as compassion to the fallen. " Verchiel said, "I cannot hear anything you say if it is not true. "[PARAGRAPH]As the woman considered, Verchiel looked within her. He was accustomed to some reaction from mortals that saw him, seeing the divine can make the corrupt repent, the simple pious, can make the devout transform. Even the most worldly had been awestruck by his presence. But this woman showed nothing. [PARAGRAPH]He saw within her a girl who didn't speak her first word until she was 8. She was raised in an asylum in Galveholm, and thought to be cursed or touched or simple. She spent years staring into the shadowed corners of her room and whispering to imagined things. Her eyes were the empty hopelessness of those who threw themselves off the high walls of Bourn, who cut themselves and watched with cold detachment as their life flowed out of them. The most remarkable thing about this woman was that she was here at all, Verchiel could see nothing within her that would motivate her to leave that small closet room at the asylum. A part of her may still remain there. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel was interrupted from his study as she spoke. [PARAGRAPH]"I want you to guide the people of this city to let us leave. If we have to fight our way out more people will die. " She said. [PARAGRAPH]"How did you consecrate this place?" Verchiel asked, ignoring her statement. [PARAGRAPH]"I didn't. " she said, "I opened a way to the Dies Diei, it is its light that you see, and feel, reflected here. "[PARAGRAPH]"And who are you?" Verchiel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I am Gosea the Dwindling, sorceress of Ceridwen. " She said. She said something after but it faded to nothing to Verchiel's ears, another lie. [PARAGRAPH]"Will you guide the city to let us leave?" Gosea asked. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel had heard of sorcerers trapping angels, but only in areas consecrated to the fallen. Bourne was no longer sacred, but he wondered if she thought it so weak that she could attack him, even beneath the city. [PARAGRAPH]"You are a husk, no different than the abomination you created from that poor dock worker. You are blind, afraid and alone. And you are dangerous. " Verchiel said. [PARAGRAPH]If his words had any effect on her, she didn't show it. "No," he continued, "I will guide them to stand against you and your queen. Faith opens our eyes, faith gives us courage and faith means that we are not alone. "[PARAGRAPH]With a thought Gosea extinguished the channel to Dies Diei. The light flickered out and the shadows rushed in to reclaim it. There was no attack from Gosea, she simply pulled her hood over her head and rested her chin on her palms while Verchiel slipped up through the top of the chamber and back into the daylight in the small plaza. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 9[PARAGRAPH]Gosea was still sitting in the runic circle when Mahon woke up. He stretched lazily and then stood up without bending his waist or using any momentum. He simply placed the soles of his feet on the floor and straightened his knees in denial of the fact that it should have been impossible to do so. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you commune with the dead?" Mahon asked, studying the circle. He had learned a little about sorcery while traveling with Gosea, but he didn't recognize any of the symbols she had carefully traced out. [PARAGRAPH]"No," she answered, "I spoke with an angel of Lugus, the one that sanctified this city. I was hoping we could skip this battle and get on to our task. "[PARAGRAPH]"I don't know much about angels. " Mahon said, "But I assume he didn't accept the offer. "[PARAGRAPH]"No. "[PARAGRAPH]"Should we be moving if he knows we are here? Can't he give someone a vision or commune with one of their sorcerers?" Mahon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I doubt there are any sorcerers talented enough to be able to see into the ether in Bourne. And holy men may be even rarer. The angel may be able to inspire those in his city, but they lack the faith to see or hear him, much as he might try. There are no miracles to be had in Bourne. "[PARAGRAPH]"I saw a miracle. " Cain said without moving. He was still on his bedroll, lying on his side and facing away from Gosea and Mahon. "The tower guard healed his companion, the one Mahon nearly decapitated. He prayed, and then it sounded like he was talking to someone. And his friend was healed. "[PARAGRAPH]"What was his name?" Gosea asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Mikel. " Cain said, "Captain Mikel Alaunus. "[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 10[PARAGRAPH]Just before dawn the next morning Mikel stood before the Cathedral of Bells. Ceth and Deirdre were with him. Deirdre was carrying Anna, who was slumped asleep on her mother's shoulder. [PARAGRAPH]All three were surprised to see that the cathedral was flooded with worshipers. And though it was the largest temple in the city, there were far too many people clamoring in front of the temple to get inside. [PARAGRAPH]"What's going on?" Deirdre asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know. " Mikel said, "Ceth, can you see if you can find Knight Commander Marlowe? I don't know if we are going to be able to find open seats for the service. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel and Deirdre waited outside and watched the crowd as Ceth tried to find Marlowe. At first Mikel wondered if the crowd may have gathered because of his vision. But these people seemed nervous and afraid. Judging by their clothing, many were from the docks. [PARAGRAPH]A few Literals came out of the temple and began to organize the crowd into smaller groups for prayers and sermons in the open square. Mikel was considering joining one when Ceth poked out of the cathedral and waved for Mikel and Deirdre to join him. [PARAGRAPH]"Marlowe has seats reserved for us. " Ceth said when they reached him. [PARAGRAPH]They followed Ceth into the cathedral. Compared to the small Fenestran temple the cathedral was a palace. A high arched foyer was decorated with candles and organ music from the nave could be heard echoing throughout. [PARAGRAPH]The nave was huge and shaped like an amphitheater, with two rows of balconies overlooking the main floor and a central stage where seven thrones faced a long, marble altar. Unlit candles wreathed the stage. Behind the stage a staircase seemed to ascend into a gold, topaz and amber sun design, but actually led to the cathedrals presbytery . [PARAGRAPH]"Luminary Rimmon would like to speak with you before the service. " Ceth said. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel followed Ceth up the cathedral's central aisle and onto the stage. Mikel felt the eyes of the crowded cathedral on their backs as they walked across the stage. It wasn't unusual to have guards in attendance, even in full uniform, but it was unusual to have them going to speak to the Luminary before the service. [PARAGRAPH]Knight Commander Marlowe was in the shallow preparation area behind the stage talking with Luminary Rimmon and a few Literals. Ceth and Mikel stood a respectful distance away until Marlowe waved them over. [PARAGRAPH]"Speaker Rimmon, allow me to introduce the soldiers I told you about. This is captain Mikel Alaunus and his lieutenant Ceth Kiln. " Marlowe said. [PARAGRAPH]"It is a pleasure to meet you captain. " Rimmon said, grasping Mikel's hand. Rimmon was a powerfully built man for a priest; he would be as comfortable on the battlefield as he was within the cathedral. His pale yellow robes and glittering necklace of sunstones contrasted with his short, practical hair and callous hands. [PARAGRAPH]"It is an honor. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"And you as well lieutenant Kiln. " Rimmon said, turning to Ceth. "Are those scars from the attack," He examined Ceth's neck, "and that were healed by the power of Lugus?"[PARAGRAPH]"Yes eyeman. I mean, yes Luminary. " Ceth said turning a bit red in the face. [PARAGRAPH]Rimmon smiled. "Eyeman is fine. You can even call me Rimmon if you want, though I have yet to meet a soldier that will do that. "[PARAGRAPH]After he was finished examining Ceth's scars Rimmon added, "And you captain Alaunus, you saw the angel?"[PARAGRAPH]"Yes Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"What did the angel look like?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"He appeared to be the angel from one of the stained glass windows in the Fenestran temple. Literal Edain identified him as Verchiel. He had skin like yellow glass with light shining through it. He appeared as a stained glass window come to life. " Mikel said. Mikel was sure that Rimmon had already heard the details of his vision, though it seemed he preferred to get an account directly from Mikel. [PARAGRAPH]"And what did he tell you?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"That there is a sickness within Bourne. That I can stop it if I have faith. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]Rimmon considered Mikel closely, much as he had investigated Ceth's scars. "Have you heard about the attack last night?"[PARAGRAPH]Mikel and Ceth exchanged concerned looks. [PARAGRAPH]"No Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"I'll let Marlowe fill you in on the details. " Rimmon said, "But the city is in a panic and I intend to use your vision to help bring calm. The people need to know that Lugus cares for us, that he is protecting us. Do you agree with that?"[PARAGRAPH]"Yes of course Luminary. " Mikel said, though he wasn't sure how he felt about his vision being used for propaganda. Or how protected the city really was if there had been an attack last night. [PARAGRAPH]After a pause Rimmon added, "Is there anything you left out of your story? Anything you would like to clarify? This is the time for brutal truth captain. "[PARAGRAPH]"No Luminary. " Mikel said, "I take the mandate of truth very seriously. It is exactly as I said. "[PARAGRAPH]"Very good captain. I don't mean to question your integrity, but before a sermon I have to make sure everything I say is true. I hope you understand. " Rimmon said. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]At that they were ushered to their seats. Marlowe had some set aside in the first balcony. There was even a seat reserved for Anna, though she preferred to sit on her mother's lap. [PARAGRAPH]"What was Luminary Rimmon like?" Deirdre whispered as they waited for the service to start. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know. " Mikel said, "He seemed worried about the city. "[PARAGRAPH]The touch of dawn light on the windows signaled the beginning of the service. Literal's funneled in from the foyer, each carrying a tall candle. As one they lit the candles around the stage, bringing the cathedral to light. [PARAGRAPH]Luminary Rimmon came up from the back of the stage with a large tome in his hands. He set the tome on a stand and then thanked the Literals, who bowed slightly and retreated to the edges of the room. [PARAGRAPH]"Another day has come, another promise has been kept. " Rimmon said. Then he paused, looking out at the assembled faces and down at his notes. Seeming to abandon his notes Rimmon spoke directly to the room. "We were attacked last night and eleven guardsmen were killed. In the docks some buildings caught fire and nearly three dozen prisoners escaped from the Drain. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel and Ceth looked first at each other and then at Marlowe, who returned their looks with a slight nod. They seemed to be the only ones in the room who didn't know about the attack. [PARAGRAPH]"Captain Cerron was one of the men killed. " Marlowe whispered. [PARAGRAPH]"Did Cain escape?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]Marlowe nodded again. [PARAGRAPH]"It was a horrible night. " Rimmon continued. "But it is day now, and Lugus has not forgotten the people of Bourne. Many of you have heard rumors of a miracle on the north bridge, and I can tell you that it is true. An angel saved the life of a guard near death and delivered a message to one of our captains warning us of the coming danger. "[PARAGRAPH]There were audible gasps from the audience. [PARAGRAPH]"That captain is with us, Captain Mikel Alaunus. As well as the man the angel saved, Lieutenant Ceth Kiln. " Rimmon gestured toward where Mikel and Ceth sat on the balcony and everyone in the temple craned to see them. "Lieutenant Kiln still carries the scars from the attack but he has recovered. The city of Bourne is unchanged. "[PARAGRAPH]Rimmon continued with his sermon, comforting and encouraging the audience to stand firm, to carry a message of hope out to the city. But Mikel lost track of his words. The angel Verchiel was walking down the center aisle of the nave, and no one seemed to notice. [PARAGRAPH]The angel's wings were spread, and exactly as he had appeared before his skin seemed to glow like the sun through honey. In his left hand he held his familiar crescent shaped shield, but in his right he held a sword that burned with a perfect golden fire. [PARAGRAPH]The light from Verchiel was nearly blinding. It reflected from every surface in the cathedral and yet no one turned to look at him. When he walked between the people and where they sat looking at Rimmon they continued to look straight ahead. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stopped at the front of the aisle, directly in front of Rimmon. If anything Rimmon may have squinted his eyes in the light, but he continued his sermon and ignored the angel. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel looked at Dierdre and Ceth, but neither seemed to notice the angel. They both sat contentedly listening to Rimmon's sermon as the angel turned and walked to the edge of the room, where a single Literal stood watching the sermon. The Literal was an old woman, as old as Mikel had ever seen working at the church. She was thin, with grey hair and age spots on her wrinkled skin. Her face was etched with wisdom and sadness. And Mikel was sure she could see the angel. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stopped in front of the woman and spoke to her. Mikel couldn't hear the angel's words, but they sounded compassionate and kind. The woman's eyes filled with tears, then she looked away and hurried out of the cathedral. [PARAGRAPH]Verchiel's light dimmed with her loss. Then with a great flap of his wings Verchiel took off into the open air of the cathedral and soared toward where Mikel was sitting in the balcony. He landed easily on the balcony rail, just in front of Dierdre, though she continued to stare through him at Rimmon just as the rest of the room was. [PARAGRAPH]"We are at the center of the sickness. I will show you that which blinds others. " Verchiel said. [PARAGRAPH]And with that the world changed to one painted in grays. Around him the ghost-like figures of the cathedral dreamed, whispered, cried or simply sat apart from the world around them. Though an angel, who retained his radiant orange and yellow colors, stood a few feet from them they didn't see him. [PARAGRAPH]"Why can't they see you?" Mikel whispered. [PARAGRAPH]"Fear, ambition, apathy. " Verchiel said, "In some cases even hope or love can bind them. Anything that can keep a man from fully trusting the divine. I have stood eternal guard over them and the city, and in too many cases I have been forced too only watch as they have suffered. I can touch upon the power of Lugus, but only as the faith of man allows. "[PARAGRAPH]"How can that faith be restored?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"We must pierce the darkness. " Verchiel and Luminary Rimmon both said at once. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel was momentarily confused by hearing the two voices together, but Rimmon continued with his sermon, unaware he had answered Mikel's question or had spoken in concert with an angel. [PARAGRAPH]"What can I do?" Mikel asked. [PARAGRAPH]"Tell your command to maintain the guards at the gates. Although they are dangerous, one of their number is injured. One of them could escape at any time by walking across the river. But the sorceress is weakened in this city, her strength will not return on this ground and she will not escape unless we allow it. "[PARAGRAPH]With that Verchiel was gone and the cathedral dropped back to the normal colors of the world, though to Mikel's eyes they seemed more drab after watching the angel. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel listened and prayed as Rimmon finished the sermon, offerings were accepted and the crowd seemed more generous on the eve of the tragedy, or more hopeful to buy some of Lugus's goodwill. [PARAGRAPH]After the closing prayer everyone rose and began funneling out of the cathedral. Mikel touched Deirdre's arm as she was about to leave. [PARAGRAPH]"Go home. " Mikel said. "I have to speak to Marlowe, I will be home soon. "[PARAGRAPH]"Come home with us. " Deirdre said, pulling at his shirt. "You have already done so much. "[PARAGRAPH]"I'll be home later. " Mikel said, then softening he kissed his wife and his daughter. "I will be okay. "[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre looked ready to argue but she let it go. She whispered something to him, but it was lost in the surrounding voices and then she was gone in the crowd heading out of the building. [PARAGRAPH]"Knight Commander," Mikel said, "may I speak with you and the Luminary Rimmon again?"[PARAGRAPH]Marlowe looked surprised, but he nodded and Marlowe, Mikel and Ceth worked their way against the crowd and down to the altar where Rimmon stood comforting a few of the parishioners that had approached him after the service. [PARAGRAPH]Intimidated by the arrival of the soldiers the parishioners said a quick goodbye and left Rimmon alone with them. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes Captain?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel became suddenly self-conscious, he looked around to see if he could see the angel, but Verchiel was gone. [PARAGRAPH]"The angel spoke to me again, during your service. " Mikel said. Ceth's eyes widened and Marlowe looked nervous. If Rimmon showed any emotion it was only a slight pursing of his lips. [PARAGRAPH]"And what did he say?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel relayed the story as he remembered it, from the vision of the gray cathedral full of parishioners wrapped in their own worries, to the warnings about watching the gates and continuing to look for Gosea and her companions. [PARAGRAPH]Rimmon listened to the whole story and considered his words carefully before asking, "Why do you think an angel would tell you to have us do something we are already doing?"[PARAGRAPH]"I don't know Luminary. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]"Why do you think the angel delivers these messages to you instead of," Rimmon paused here, picking his words carefully, "more senior members of the temple?"[PARAGRAPH]"I don't know Luminary. " Mikel answered again. [PARAGRAPH]"Your vision and the people in this cathedral that couldn't hear the angel because of their more earthly concerns, did that apply to me as well?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel began to answer that he didn't know again. But he did know, and he again thought of his vows and the Mandate of Truth. [PARAGRAPH]"Yes Luminary, I believe it did. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel kept his eyes down on the floor, he didn't want to know what expression was on Rimmon's face. [PARAGRAPH]"Is there anything else captain?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"No Luminary. "[PARAGRAPH]With that Rimmon turned and walked back across the stage and into the presbytery. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 11[PARAGRAPH]It was a long walk back to Wyn Manor. Mikel had said goodbye to Ceth and Marlowe at the Cathedral of Bells and he kept his head down as he walked across the city. A few people called out to him as he passed, even some he didn't know and he half-heartedly returned their calls. [PARAGRAPH]He entered the Wyn manor kitchen as he had before, the kitchen smelled good and there was a fresh plate of bread and cheese sitting on the table. [PARAGRAPH]"Diery?" AnnaSophia called from upstairs. [PARAGRAPH]"No," Mikel called back, suddenly shaken out of his dark thoughts, "It's Mikel. Did Deirdre leave?"[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia came into the kitchen and her expression answered Mikel's question. Before she said anything he was back out the door and running toward the small house he shared with his wife and daughter. [PARAGRAPH]She wasn't supposed to go home alone, but maybe she forgot something. Maybe Anna wanted one of her toys. There is no chance that, out of all of the people of Bourne, Deirdre and Anna would run into Gosea. But somehow Mikel knew that was exactly what happened. Cain knew who he was. Everyone in the city was talking about them, it wouldn't have been hard to find out he had a wife and daughter. [PARAGRAPH]By the time he reached his house his world began falling apart one piece at a time. First the note pinned to the front door with a hairpin like Deirdre wore. He opened it with shaking hands. [PARAGRAPH][PARAGRAPH]Mikel,[PARAGRAPH]Order your men, claim a vision, do whatever you need to do to draw the guards away from the harbor gate tonight. If you do so, we will leave the city without incident. If you don't we will sacrifice your wife and your sweet daughter to Ceridwen, the breaker of men, and then kill many more on our way out of your dusty city. [PARAGRAPH]The choice is yours. Cain hopes you deny us, your wife reminds him of his own. [PARAGRAPH] - Gosea[PARAGRAPH][PARAGRAPH]Mikel was back at Wyn manor. He hadn't noticed the walk back, the city was a distant echo, a world apart from the prison of fear collapsing on him. AnnaSophia met him in the yard, and though she asked questions he couldn't understand them. He only held out the note as explanation. She read it and rushed him into the house. [PARAGRAPH]"Mikel, Deirdre needs you. Anna needs you. " AnnaSophia said, that at least echoed through to him. [PARAGRAPH]"I'm here. " Mikel replied, "I understand. " He tried to force the fear away. I need to get to the guard station, I need. . . to pray. "[PARAGRAPH]"No," AnnaSophia said, her voice perfectly calm, her eyes as focused and adamant as any knight commander. "You must do what they want. "[PARAGRAPH]"I cannot forsake Lugus. " Mikel said, "He will protect Deirdre and Anna, he will protect us if we remain faithful. As he did with Ceth. "[PARAGRAPH]"I have lost one faithful family member in Lugus's service already, I will not offer up my daughter and granddaughter!" AnnaSophia nearly screamed, her resolve falling apart like shattered glass. "Do you imagine that the faithful never fail, that they never suffer, that they never die? That I didn't once tell myself that Lugus would protect what I loved and bring him home safe? You can bring her home safe, you are the only one. "[PARAGRAPH]"Let me pray. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 12[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel knew Deirdre and Anna were being held in an abandoned workshop near the docks. He knew that Cain was watching them and that if the guards rushed the building they could save them before Cain could kill them. But there was a reason Gosea had taken Mikel's wife, she didn't know if she could control him, but she knew she could destroy him. And now Verchiel watched the small flicker of Mikel's faith, that gateway that allowed him to speak to Mikel, go out. [PARAGRAPH]Though Mikel prayed, though tears ran down his face and he desperately wanted to hear, and though Verchiel stood beside him in spirit, with tears streaming down his own face, that vast chasm of fear and doubt kept them apart. [PARAGRAPH]"Your desire to be faithful isn't enough. " Verchiel whispered. "You must give up your fear, you must place your faith in Lugus and I will make you a beacon that will drive away the night. "[PARAGRAPH]But Mikel couldn't hear him. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 13[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia hands only trembled a bit as she sipped her tea. [PARAGRAPH]"Did you get an answer?" she asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel stood up, still stunned as he had been ever since he saw the note, but he no longer had the delusion of a quick solution. [PARAGRAPH]"No, I saw the angel before, he talked to me, I don't know why he won't come now. "[PARAGRAPH]AnnaSophia didn't offer an answer. [PARAGRAPH]"I love my city, I love my religion and I love Lugus. " She said carefully. "But there is a limit to all things. Maybe I'm weak, but we can't sacrifice the people we love for our beliefs. It doesn't serve Lugus to let them die. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel picked up the note and headed out the manor's front door. [PARAGRAPH]"Are you going to save them?" AnnaSophia asked. [PARAGRAPH]He stopped in the doorway with his back to her. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know. " Mikel said, it was all he could offer before he headed out into the street. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 14[PARAGRAPH]Mikel met Commander Marlowe and Luminary Rimmon at the Cathedral of Bells. The vaulted ceilings of the cathedral had never seemed more empty, and though they stood close together and talked in hushed tones in the empty cathedral, their voices echoed back them in conspiratorial whispers. [PARAGRAPH]"I know what they are going to try to do. " Mikel said. [PARAGRAPH]Marlowe hadn't questioned Mikel's request to meet at the temple with Rimmon. Both men could see the concern and panic on Mikel's face and in his voice. Though they waited, Mikel didn't say anything. [PARAGRAPH]"Is Deirdre okay?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel's head fell into his hands. "No Luminary, she's not. They took her and Anna. I don't know where they are. "[PARAGRAPH]Mikel explained the note and the threat as they listened. [PARAGRAPH]"Maybe we are best to let them flee the city, and we will have the best chance to save Mikel's wife and daughter. Commander do you really think you could stop them if they wanted to fight their way out? The witch's power is considerable. " Rimmon said. [PARAGRAPH]"I don't know Luminary. " Marlowe answered. "But they have killed my men, our brothers, I still have families to meet with. Though more may die, I cannot simply let them go unavenged. "[PARAGRAPH]"What are your thought's Captain? Am I to assume that you wish to fight the battle since you declined their offer to mislead us?" Rimmon asked. [PARAGRAPH]"I am bound by the Mandate of Truth. " Mikel said, "And I remain devote to the sun, even during deepest night. What if we pretend to abandon the gate?"[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 15[PARAGRAPH]Mahon slipped in the small home through a panel in the roof, falling to the floor with the grace of a dancer stepping from one step to another. [PARAGRAPH]"Did they clear the gate?" Gosea asked. [PARAGRAPH]"They are pretending to. Soldiers are disguised as commoners, some are hidden in the gatehouse. The chains inside the gate hang unlocked, but they have attached another set on the other side of the gate. "[PARAGRAPH]"What needless sacrifice. " Gosea said, mostly to herself. "Cain, kill the mother and child. "[PARAGRAPH]"Does it matter?" Cain asked, and though Gosea's dark eyes didn't reflect any irritation at his question, she did study him closely. [PARAGRAPH]"I assumed we would kill them either way. " Mahon said as he settled on the couch. [PARAGRAPH]"It's a spiritual game we play. " Gosea answered. "If the captain would have betrayed his city and god, then I have no need for his family, he is broken. But if he has chosen to trust his faith, then I cannot allow that fire to burn at our back. I cannot have his faith rewarded or we risk a new enemy for Galveholm. "[PARAGRAPH]"If we kill his family, he will be an enemy of Galveholm. " Cain said. [PARAGRAPH]"A man of faith can do more than an army of soldiers. He is useless broken. Kill his family. "[PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 16[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel dropped to his knees and cried. He was an angel of Lugus, lord of the dawn and revelation, but he was unable to deliver his message. He knew where Mikel's wife and daughter were imprisoned, Verchiel was kneeling beside them in the ether. But Mikel was too full of fear and doubt to hear the angel's voice. Even now the witch and her guards were in the small homes common room planning to kill their prisoners. Deirdre and Anna had only a few minutes left to live. [PARAGRAPH]"Why are you crying?"[PARAGRAPH]Verchiel stopped in surprise. He looked up to see see the innocent face of Anna looking at him quizzically. [PARAGRAPH]"Can you see me child?" Verchiel asked, equally puzzled. [PARAGRAPH]"Of course. " she said, "What is your name?"[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre sat staring at the iron bound door of the cell as she had since she was taken. The room was an old cellar and still had a pile of old tools and supplies in it. She had been through it a dozen times but there was nothing that could help her escape. She tried to stay strong and save her tears for when her daughter wasn't watching. She was so lost in her thoughts it took her a minute to realize Anna was holding a conversation with an old broom. [PARAGRAPH]"Chipmunk, who are you talking to?" Deirdre asked. [PARAGRAPH]Anna smiled, "His name is Verchiel, he's an angel and he will help us get back to daddy. "[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre had no words. At three years old her daughter had gone crazy. Deirdre wasn't sure if she should be jealous of her daughters hope, or condemn her for it. [PARAGRAPH]"We need something shiny" Anna said, going through the pile of supplies. She finally found an old copper plate that seemed to satisfy her and she started cleaning it with the hem of her dress. [PARAGRAPH]Deirdre heard the door to the cellar open. It was barely an hour since they had been fed and an unexpected visit from their kidnappers couldn't be good. Deirdre pulled Anna into her arms and when she squirmed Deirdre told her to be quiet. [PARAGRAPH]There was a jingle of keys and the cellar door opened. Cain, the largest of the kidnappers, opened the door. He had his axe drawn. [PARAGRAPH]"Sorry" he said with some sympathy, "your husband's too stubborn for his own good. "[PARAGRAPH]At that Anna tore free of her mother's grip and stood protectively in front of her. She held the polished copper plate above her head and Cain stepped back slightly at the sudden move. Nothing happened. [PARAGRAPH]Then Anna asked the broom, "What do I say?"[PARAGRAPH]"Come on. " Cain said. "There's no joy in killing a child. But you won't be my first. "[PARAGRAPH]"You cannot hide your actions" Anna shouted in a voice half her own and half unworldly, "Lugus will reveal all. If you mean to escape, then flee now into the darkness; this area has been claimed by the rose of summer!"[PARAGRAPH]Deirdre was stunned. But Cain wasn't about to be cowed by a three year with an old plate, and he stepped towards Anna. [PARAGRAPH]The copper plate exploded in light. It was as if Anna held the sun above her head. Cain covered his eyes in pain as light flooded the cellar, the small stairway and up in-to the home. Inside the house it rushed over Mahon and Gosea and broke free of every window or crack in the home's walls and spilled out onto the dark streets of Bourne and through the patchwork roof up into the night sky. [PARAGRAPH]Everyone in Bourne who had ever whispered a silent prayer to Lugus felt the stirring of holy power. The guards hidden at the harbor gate threw off their disguises and rushed to the home, as did the nearby watch and the local eyemen. [PARAGRAPH]Cain tried to stand against the waves of blinding light even though it burnt through to his closed and shielded eyes. He placed his axe in front of him and risked one peek at where he thought Anna was standing. When he looked he saw a golden angel standing before him with a blazing sword. [PARAGRAPH]"My arda is upon these two, you will not harm them. " the angel said. [PARAGRAPH]Cain raised his axe and pressed forward, but he was engulfed in light. Every darkness within him was undone, every cruel, pained memory swallowed like shadows chased out of a brightly lit room. Cain slumped back against the wall, his arms fell to his side and he dropped the axe on the floor. There were no memories left, and he stared up into the light with the innocence of a child. [PARAGRAPH]"It's okay. " Anna said as she stepped forward and took his large calloused hand in hers. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 17[PARAGRAPH]As the light exploded out of the small house's cellar Mahon and Gosea both fled out into the street. [PARAGRAPH]"Take the Heartstone. " Gosea said, pushing the delicately wrapped package into Mahon's hands. "Get it to Tebryn, get out of this city. "[PARAGRAPH]"I won't leave you alone. " Mahon argued. [PARAGRAPH]City guards carrying lanterns were already flooding onto the street, the site of the house still bursting with light caused them to pause briefly, but they would see Ma-hon and Gosea soon. [PARAGRAPH]"I am never alone. " Gosea said. "Get over the wall, now!"[PARAGRAPH]Mahon turned to look at the nearly 40 foot tall stone wall, "I'm going to need some help. " he said to himself. [PARAGRAPH]Gosea turned toward the guards and was careful to stay away from any of the beams of light streaming out of the house. [PARAGRAPH]"Sino, Vulnero, Dolor, Carcer, Ictus. . . " and on Gosea went, naming the myriad of spirits bound into her rings, runes and tattoos. At each name a spirit flew from her, a few, then dozens as her calls blurred together and became as wild and powerful as a storm at sea. Each spirit followed her command and jumped into the lanterns the guards carried, possessing the fire, gathering the oil about them and then leaping out onto the guards or the surrounding buildings. [PARAGRAPH]Guards screamed and rolled on the ground, but these flames couldn't simply be doused, they would leap off the guards and leap back. Guards tried patting each other down, or throwing their cloaks on each other, but it only caused confusion and the flames continued to dance among them. [PARAGRAPH]"Obey me" Gosea shouted as she flung her hands up over her head, away from the guards and toward the wall. As one, all of the flames streaked through the night air like dragonfire and struck the wall, sending oil straying in all directions, creating a pillar of thick, black smoke. But the wall had survived sieges, outside of some char marks it was unaffected. [PARAGRAPH]Commander Marlowe and Mikel reached the street in time to see the scattered guards still trying to understand what had happened. Marlowe immediately began shouting orders for the men to form up and prepare to rush the house, a squad was ordered to start triaging buckets of water and the injured were pulled back behind the lines. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel saw Gosea and Mahon standing silhouetted by the fire burning against the city wall. [PARAGRAPH]"Wait, Mikel. " Marlowe yelled, "They aren't going anywhere, they are trapped. "[PARAGRAPH]"No, they're not. " Mikel yelled back as he drew his sword and charged toward them. [PARAGRAPH]"Go!" Gosea shouted to Mahon. Spurred on by her words he sprinted toward the burning wall. Gosea turned to face Mikel, and her face was as pale and impassive as the moon. Even shadowed by the burning wall behind her Mikel could still see those immutable dark eyes. [PARAGRAPH]"Surrender!" Mikel shouted. [PARAGRAPH]Gosea didn't reply. Meaning to push quickly by her, Mikel dipped down, sweeping his sword low, below her arm and towards her thigh for a cut that would be painful, but not lethal. [PARAGRAPH]At the last moment Gosea moved toward Mikel, stabbing at him from a thin dagger in a hand that had appeared empty. The dagger went right through Mikel's arm, catching itself between the twin bones of the forearm and digging all the way through until its point poked out of the other side of his arm. This stopped his swing and she used his momentum, and her leverage to spin him around. [PARAGRAPH]Blinded by pain Mikel slammed the metal gloved fist of his other hand into Gosea's face. The witch's head snapped back, her nose shattered and her facial features swam as bones broke and gave way under the force. She let go of her knife and collapsed backwards onto the street. [PARAGRAPH]Nearly choking on blood Gosea spoke one more name, "Peractio. "[PARAGRAPH]A winged serpent the size of a man burst painfully up out of Gosea. Flowing from every part of her it filled her mouth, her nose, her ears and though she tried to scream, the serpent kept her from doing so. [PARAGRAPH]Mikel pulled the dagger out of his arm and switched his sword to the other hand just in time to block the serpent's first attack. Though his sword cut right across the serpent's body, the steel did not injure the demonic creature. [PARAGRAPH]The serpent lunged again and Mikel was forced to back up against the house. In the distance he could see Gosea struggling to get back up on her feet and the end of Mahon's sprint toward the burning wall. Instead of being stopped by the wall Mahon jumped up and stepped on the billowing smoke, riding it up and continuing to jump from black, ashy plume to plume to the top of the wall. [PARAGRAPH]With his back to the small house Mikel ducked another attack by the serpent and brought his sword up in a wide arch, an attack the serpent easily avoided as his sword plunged into one of the house's closed shutters. With his weapon trapped the serpent hissed, his eyes were cold, black and empty and for a brief second Mikel was lost in the utter lack of passion or rage in them. [PARAGRAPH]Then Mikel ripped the shutter off of the window and the serpent was bathed in the streaming white light bursting out of the house. The creature howled the sound of wind rushing down an endless pit and broke apart like oil consumed by fire. [PARAGRAPH]CHAPTER 18[PARAGRAPH]Gosea was quickly apprehended. The enigmatic witch was gone, replaced by a scared young woman who cursed the guards, the city and Lugus loudly and with great fervor. Though riders were sent from the gate to chase down Mahon, he wasn't found. [PARAGRAPH]But it was Marlowe's voice that drew Mikel's attention. The soldiers had charged into the house, whose light was beginning to dim, and the commander's voice thundered above the burning fire, the screaming witch, and the growing amount of soldiers rushing into the square. It was a call of something more important than battle and demons and Mikel rushed to get to him. [PARAGRAPH]The soldiers parted as Mikel rushed into the house where his wife and daughter stood smiling and uninjured. Mikel swept them both up into his arms. It was hours before he let go of either of them. [PARAGRAPH]</Spanish>

		<English>Mahon Flauros Alexis is a preeminent members of Clan Flauros, the vampire caste known as the Warlords. He is a third generation Vampire, raised directly by Alexis's brother and loyal to no one else. Being raised as a Vampire requires complete supplication, which is eternal. This makes it impossible for Mahon to resist the spells of his lord, and for Flauros to resist Alexis. The Butcher might otherwise have overthrown Alexis ages ago. [PARAGRAPH]Mahon is one of the Seven Aspects of War. Every god has seven aspects. They take very different forms depending on the dominion, for most they are special True Angels whose affinity for their dominion is exceeded only by the Archangels and the Gods themselves. Oghma's aspects are The Historians. Kilmorph's are the Pillars of Creation. Ceridwen's are Seven Sisters. Agares's are the Unraveling, who were Amathaon's aspects called the Fathers of Worlds before he corrupted them. Camulos has seven True Angels of Chaos, but all were vanquished during the Godswar. This was, however, not their end. The Aspects of War are reborn among the mortals of Erebus whenever one is slain. Years can pass between reincarnations, but there are usually 7 alive at a time. The Sons of Discord (a cult devoted to Camulos) spend a lot of time trying to track these individuals down. Being an Aspect of War is the highest blessing Camulos can grant, but he does not care who gets it so long as they use their power to kill. It is given at birth and cannot be revoked. Some are Good, some are Evil, and some are hostile towards both factions, but they are not likely to remain neutral in any conflict for long. Notable Aspects of War include Arak the Erkling, Capria, Mahon the Butcher, Orthus, Magnadine, Surder, and Makhai (an Ogre who in the Age of Ruin shall command the Cult of the Blood God). All the Aspects have super human martial abilities, both in personal combat and in tactics. They are nearly unstoppable fighting one-on-one, but they cannot defeat a whole army on their own. They are the cause of most wars, regardless of their intent. </English>

[PARAGRAPH]Though he was investigated, and a few children came close to escaping, Meresin was never caught and he tortured and killed hundreds of children in his life. It wasn't until a plague spread through the city, and Meresin began collecting the newly orphaned (and sick) children that he also contracted the plague that killed him. Then the town found the cellar where children were still caged and the floor was covered with ash and bones. [PARAGRAPH]The orphanage is still haunted by the spirits of the children that died there. Ghosts that linger in the crematorium and a Caller in the Darkness that dwells in the cellar. Children that pass too close to the ruins (especially at night) are drawn to them. An Elohim priestess attempted to sanctify the ruins the the Age of Rebirth but was killed in the attempt and now her spirit wanders the area trying to find someone else to break the curse. [PARAGRAPH]After his death Meresin became a demon, his focus is on runaways. He is the voice that calls from the shadows, the comfort for the lost, and the voice that stokes the flames of anger and rebellion against parents. He still carries his barbed flail. If Meresin is summoned he can curse enemies with a disease that causes them to sweat blood or invoke feelings of lust, but he requires a living child in trade.</Spanish>

[PARAGRAPH]Statius can be summoned in a ritual that requires the sacrifice of something the summoner loves.

		<English>[TAB]Sallos was a soldier from a small and dismal duchy at the edge of the Patrian Empire. He grew tired of what he thought was a meaningless life. When he captured a Merry Dancer (a former demon who had been saved by the compassion of Sirona, repented, forsaken all forms of violence and hatred and become a creature of joy, beauty and peace) he sacrificed it in the hope that something will hear his call. [PARAGRAPH]His call was heard; Hyborem answered and offered him seven years of power in exchange for his eternal servitude and that of his descendants (his wife was pregnant with their son Asmoday at the time). [PARAGRAPH]Sallos accepted. [PARAGRAPH]In those seven years Sallos rose to become a Patrian duke. After the time was over he died suddenly and after surviving the torments of hell, he became a ruler there as well. [PARAGRAPH]It is unusual for a mortal soul to rise to a duke in the demonic ranks. He maintains his status because his descendants retain devout to Sallos's pledge. They have formed a family secret society called the Daughters of Saleos based on demonic worship and incest (to keep their bloodline of Sallos pure). [PARAGRAPH]Members of this cult (which include all genders, although its leadership is strictly matriarchal) are claimed by Sallos upon death and used as he desires. Some go through the torments of hell, some serve him directly, and some continue to serve the Daughters of Saleos as demonic spirits. [PARAGRAPH:3]Asmoday is the eldest of Sallos's 34 children. When he was seven he inherited a wealthy Patrian duchy following his father's early death, but everything fell to ruin. Blights struck the crops, plagues hit his people, trade relations soured. As he grew into a young man his duchy crumbled around him. It wasn't until Kylorin came to review the duchy and explained his latent ability that Asmoday felt like anything other than a failure. As a member of the Imprimatur Council he learned control for his power and the ability to focus it to tear people, armies and empires apart. [PARAGRAPH]Asmoday battled the Empyrean, broke Dies Diei, blinded the captured priests and then offered them as a gift to Alexis. [PARAGRAPH]He had an irrational hatred for elves, capturing, torturing and killing any he found. Rumors of "elven blood" in Dust citizens was often enough to get them killed. He was a member of the Coven of the Black Candle with Faeryl, but never would have participated if he had known she was there (and vise-versa since the elves knew what happened to them in his duchy and hated him for it). [PARAGRAPH]During the second revolution, revolutionaries came to Dust in response to rumors that a tax had been imposed, that every village would supply a child for demonic sacrifice. These revolutionaries (thousands of farmers and workers from across Patria with crude weapons) were crushed by trained soldiers, black magic and demonic spirits. The bodies were then set on long pikes and marched back to their home cities where they were displayed impaled at the village center. The town was gathered to curse and spit on the corpses of the revolutionaries, and any that didn't were impaled and put up on a pike beside them. Then each home village was ordered to select a child for sacrifice, and they all did. This was the end of the second revolution. [PARAGRAPH]In the third revolution Asmoday caused the Sanctus Inquisition to turn against Basium by ringing summoning circles with the innocent, that Basium would tear through in battle and hiding mages in villages that Basium would destroy to uncover. Ultimately Basium became more feared than the Imprimatur Council and the Inquisition nearly lost support for the civil war. Rather than risk openly opposing Basium (which they feared would lead to him turning on them) the Inquisition abandoned Basium in battle, and without the protection of the golden fire Asmoday and his mages defeated Basium. They would have killed him if Basium's twin Gyra hadn't pulled him from the battlefield and into the Otherworld. [PARAGRAPH]Following the defeat of Basium Kylorin went alone to face Asmoday. Within that battle Kylorin was faced with every evil action he had performed, every life he had carelessly ruined, a legacy of pain he had submitted the world to. By the end, Asmoday was dead. But Kylorin was also finished with war. The only battle he fought in the Patrian civil war after that was against Henri Ghouls, who Kylorin wouldn't kill. [PARAGRAPH]After Asmoday's death his followers entombed his corpse on the Isle of Scorpions. The isle was once green and full of life but after burying Asmoday there, all life died or fled and the isle itself started slipping into the sea. A few decades after his burial a shipwreck occurred nearby and the survivors swam to the island. It would have been better for them to die at sea. They quickly turned on each other and within a few days they were all dead. Sometimes their spirits can still be seen wandering the island, especially during storms. [PARAGRAPH]After his death the Daughters of Saleos summoned the soul of Asmoday and bound it to a skull carved from a Zabulus horn. It is known as the Skull of Asmoday and it is their most prized relic and a powerful source of entropy magic. [PARAGRAPH]Asmoday was buried with his Mask of Esus. During the Age of Invention his grave was dug up, the mask was stolen and used to steal the Heart of Fire. </English>

Rather than risk openly opposing Basium (which they feared would lead to him turning on them) the Inquisition abandoned Basium in battle, and without the protection of the golden fire Asmoday and his mages defeated Basium.

		<Spanish>[TAB]Sallos was a soldier from a small and dismal duchy at the edge of the Patrian Empire. He grew tired of what he thought was a meaningless life. When he captured a Merry Dancer (a former demon who had been saved by the compassion of Sirona, repented, forsaken all forms of violence and hatred and become a creature of joy, beauty and peace) he sacrificed it in the hope that something will hear his call. [PARAGRAPH]His call was heard; Hyborem answered and offered him seven years of power in exchange for his eternal servitude and that of his descendants (his wife was pregnant with their son Asmoday at the time). [PARAGRAPH]Sallos accepted. [PARAGRAPH]In those seven years Sallos rose to become a Patrian duke. After the time was over he died suddenly and after surviving the torments of hell, he became a ruler there as well. [PARAGRAPH]It is unusual for a mortal soul to rise to a duke in the demonic ranks. He maintains his status because his descendants retain devout to Sallos's pledge. They have formed a family secret society called the Daughters of Saleos based on demonic worship and incest (to keep their bloodline of Sallos pure). [PARAGRAPH]Members of this cult (which include all genders, although its leadership is strictly matriarchal) are claimed by Sallos upon death and used as he desires. Some go through the torments of hell, some serve him directly, and some continue to serve the Daughters of Saleos as demonic spirits. [PARAGRAPH:3]Asmoday is the eldest of Sallos's 34 children. When he was seven he inherited a wealthy Patrian duchy following his father's early death, but everything fell to ruin. Blights struck the crops, plagues hit his people, trade relations soured. As he grew into a young man his duchy crumbled around him. It wasn't until Kylorin came to review the duchy and explained his latent ability that Asmoday felt like anything other than a failure. As a member of the Imprimatur Council he learned control for his power and the ability to focus it to tear people, armies and empires apart. [PARAGRAPH]Asmoday battled the Empyrean, broke Dies Diei, blinded the captured priests and then offered them as a gift to Alexis. [PARAGRAPH]He had an irrational hatred for elves, capturing, torturing and killing any he found. Rumors of "elven blood" in Dust citizens was often enough to get them killed. He was a member of the Coven of the Black Candle with Faeryl, but never would have participated if he had known she was there (and vise-versa since the elves knew what happened to them in his duchy and hated him for it). [PARAGRAPH]During the second revolution, revolutionaries came to Dust in response to rumors that a tax had been imposed, that every village would supply a child for demonic sacrifice. These revolutionaries (thousands of farmers and workers from across Patria with crude weapons) were crushed by trained soldiers, black magic and demonic spirits. The bodies were then set on long pikes and marched back to their home cities where they were displayed impaled at the village center. The town was gathered to curse and spit on the corpses of the revolutionaries, and any that didn't were impaled and put up on a pike beside them. Then each home village was ordered to select a child for sacrifice, and they all did. This was the end of the second revolution. [PARAGRAPH]In the third revolution Asmoday caused the Sanctus Inquisition to turn against Basium by ringing summoning circles with the innocent, that Basium would tear through in battle and hiding mages in villages that Basium would destroy to uncover. Ultimately Basium became more feared than the Imprimatur Council and the Inquisition nearly lost support for the civil war.

		<English>Kouronos was lost. Lost in Hell.The last skirmish with demons had separated them from their unit after a fog had settled upon the field. Kouronos had lost consciousness during that event. Now he stood at the edge of the battlefield, which resembled hell more than ever. A red sky and barren, dead earth were the typical sight. But the valley in front of him was grueseome; no training could have prepared him for that. Every Bannor soldier lay there, crippled or torn to pieces, covered with blood and guts.[NEWLINE]He threw up. Kneeling he noticed a known voice: "Are you alright, Kouronos?"[NEWLINE]He turned his head round and saw his older friend. "Tipaso?", he asked, his voice trembling.[NEWLINE]"Yes, it is me."[NEWLINE]"What happened? I... I have never seen such cruelties! And why are we still alive?"[NEWLINE]Without hesitating, Tipaso responded: "Luck. Nothing but luck."[NEWLINE]Kouronos, gaining control over his body again, stood up. "Are you sure, that it only was luck? I can't believe, that we're living. Maybe Junil wanted to save us?", he said with his typical confidence.[NEWLINE]"You still believe in such nonsense, don't you? There is nothing like divine intervention. Oh well, you're young and hopeful. Even if so, we are in Agares' realm; Junil has no power here!... What are you doing?" bellowed Tipaso, looking astonishedly at Kouronos, who was on his knees again.[NEWLINE]"I'm praying. For the dead's souls.", he answered calmly.[NEWLINE]"Are you crazy? Demons will appear here every second! We should move it!" Tipaso, who started acting hysterical, began to pull his younger friend away.[NEWLINE]"Well, it is too late now.", said a voice as clear as crystal, "Fortunately we found you." Kouronos and Tipaso turned and beheld an appearance, which was the complete contrary of the surroundings. An angel with the whitest wings they had ever seen, walked towards them. "My name is Bertus. I am the leader of our small scouting troop", the angel introduced himself, pointing at a group of angels behind him. "Who are you and what are you doing out here?"[NEWLINE]"I am Tipaso and the boy beside me is Kouronos from the Bannor.", replied the older soldier. He told him about the happenings. During the talk Kouronos studied the angel more thoroughly. He listened carefully, as if there were more behind his words. Yet his face showed no sign of any feeling. In terms of purity, the white wings at his back were even surpassed by his hair. He had no real weapon, which was quite unusual for an angel, Kouronos knew. Instead he bore a whip, irradiating an unearthly light. Suddenly the expression on Bertus' face changed from what could be interpreted as mild concern to blatant hatred. He noticed it with fear.[NEWLINE]"You dare lying to me? I know you sold your friends to survive." Although the angel said this in a talkative tone; Tipaso seemed to be shot with icy arrows. The soldier's fear became blank horror. With a fast movement, Bertus entangled Tipaso with his whip. Kouronos heard a fizzling sound, then a scream. Only ash remained, where his friend stood. As though it couldn't be worse the angel looked at him with freezing cold eyes.[NEWLINE]"I have a question for you: Do you believe?". Kouronos realized, that the angel had addressed him.[NEWLINE]"Y..Y..Yes..", he stuttered.[NEWLINE]"Then there is still hope.", Bertus replied. Kouronos' last feeling was a burning pain, as he was hit by an irradiating light. Then darkness engulfed him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kouronos opened his eyes. Again. He looked into the burning sky. The pain had gone. He could not move but something has changed. His back... It felt as he wasn't lying on it. Something was between him and the ashy earth. His attempts at moving were in vain.[NEWLINE]"Don't move. You're still weak." A head appeared in front of him; the eyes seemed to radiate. It was Bertus. His first thought was: Am I dead know?[NEWLINE]"You are. In a way. And at the same time you live on. You have wings on your back. You are an angel now, Kouronos." The angel seemed to talk to his inner thoughts. "Your faith saved you. But your friend is dead. Forever. For him, there was only death." Bertus straightened and disappeared from Kouronos' sight. This revelation amazed him. His thoughts began to race. A strong fatigue spread over him.[NEWLINE]However, he heard some orders being shouted. "Private! You take our greenhorn back to the encampment. The rest deploys and explores the land around the valley. Maybe we can find more recruits."[NEWLINE]This was the last word, before he fell asleep.</English>

And why are we still alive?"[NEWLINE]Without hesitating, Tipaso responded: "Luck. Nothing but luck."[NEWLINE]Kouronos, gaining control over his body again, stood up. "Are you sure, that it only was luck? I can't believe, that we're living. Maybe Junil wanted to save us?", he said with his typical confidence.[NEWLINE]"You still believe in such nonsense, don't you? There is nothing like divine intervention. Oh well, you're young and hopeful. Even if so, we are in Agares' realm; Junil has no power here!... What are you doing?" bellowed Tipaso, looking astonishedly at Kouronos, who was on his knees again.[NEWLINE]"I'm praying. For the dead's souls.", he answered calmly.[NEWLINE]"Are you crazy? Demons will appear here every second! We should move it!" Tipaso, who started acting hysterical, began to pull his younger friend away.[NEWLINE]"Well, it is too late now.", said a voice as clear as crystal, "Fortunately we found you." Kouronos and Tipaso turned and beheld an appearance, which was the complete contrary of the surroundings. An angel with the whitest wings they had ever seen, walked towards them. "My name is Bertus. I am the leader of our small scouting troop", the angel introduced himself, pointing at a group of angels behind him. "Who are you and what are you doing out here?"[NEWLINE]"I am Tipaso and the boy beside me is Kouronos from the Bannor.", replied the older soldier. He told him about the happenings. During the talk Kouronos studied the angel more thoroughly. He listened carefully, as if there were more behind his words. Yet his face showed no sign of any feeling. In terms of purity, the white wings at his back were even surpassed by his hair. He had no real weapon, which was quite unusual for an angel, Kouronos knew. Instead he bore a whip, irradiating an unearthly light. Suddenly the expression on Bertus' face changed from what could be interpreted as mild concern to blatant hatred. He noticed it with fear.[NEWLINE]"You dare lying to me? I know you sold your friends to survive." Although the angel said this in a talkative tone; Tipaso seemed to be shot with icy arrows. The soldier's fear became blank horror. With a fast movement, Bertus entangled Tipaso with his whip. Kouronos heard a fizzling sound, then a scream. Only ash remained, where his friend stood. As though it couldn't be worse the angel looked at him with freezing cold eyes.[NEWLINE]"I have a question for you: Do you believe?". Kouronos realized, that the angel had addressed him.[NEWLINE]"Y..Y..Yes..", he stuttered.[NEWLINE]"Then there is still hope.", Bertus replied. Kouronos' last feeling was a burning pain, as he was hit by an irradiating light. Then darkness engulfed him.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Kouronos opened his eyes. Again. He looked into the burning sky. The pain had gone. He could not move but something has changed. His back... It felt as he wasn't lying on it. Something was between him and the ashy earth. His attempts at moving were in vain.[NEWLINE]"Don't move. You're still weak." A head appeared in front of him; the eyes seemed to radiate. It was Bertus. His first thought was: Am I dead know?[NEWLINE]"You are. In a way. And at the same time you live on. You have wings on your back. You are an angel now, Kouronos." The angel seemed to talk to his inner thoughts. "Your faith saved you. But your friend is dead. Forever. For him, there was only death." Bertus straightened and disappeared from Kouronos' sight. This revelation amazed him. His thoughts began to race. A strong fatigue spread over him.[NEWLINE]However, he heard some orders being shouted. "Private! You take our greenhorn back to the encampment. The rest deploys and explores the land around the valley. Maybe we can find more recruits."[NEWLINE]This was the last word, before he fell asleep.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Kouronos was lost. Lost in Hell.The last skirmish with demons had separated them from their unit after a fog had settled upon the field. Kouronos had lost consciousness during that event. Now he stood at the edge of the battlefield, which resembled hell more than ever. A red sky and barren, dead earth were the typical sight. But the valley in front of him was grueseome; no training could have prepared him for that. Every Bannor soldier lay there, crippled or torn to pieces, covered with blood and guts.[NEWLINE]He threw up. Kneeling he noticed a known voice: "Are you alright, Kouronos?"[NEWLINE]He turned his head round and saw his older friend. "Tipaso?", he asked, his voice trembling.[NEWLINE]"Yes, it is me."[NEWLINE]"What happened? I... I have never seen such cruelties!
