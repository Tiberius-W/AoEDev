		<English>The night had been particularly harsh.  Coaxoch wept at the sight of her clutch covered in glittering frost.  She had tried.  She had kept the fire burning through the night.  It wasn't enough.  She wasn't alone; as dawn's light filtered into the huts, the sound of mourning grew.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Coaxoch sang the song of grief, but it gave her no comfort.  Coaxoch sang the song of hope, but it gave her no relief.  Then, Coaxoch sang a new song, one no Mazatl had sung before.  She sang to the tiny patch of jungle where she lived.  She sang of warmth and rain, of sun and new birth.  This helped, so she kept singing, pouring new verses straight from her heart.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]She became dimly aware of other Mazatl now singing the same song.  A song never sung before, yet in perfect harmony.  And as the chorus spread through the tribe, she noticed the ice retreating.  Her jungle could resist Mulcarn.  Her people could resist Mulcarn.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Coaxoch would teach them how.</English>
