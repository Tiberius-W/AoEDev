		<English>The great day has come!
The promised children of Danalin have returned to us, in splendour and wreathed in gold!
With grace and ease, they welcome us into their homes, the warm air blowing the scent of a feast through the door!
With generosity and patience, they share the wealth of their great markets, overflowing with riches!
With wisdom and kindness, they study in their marbled halls, slick with dripping black wax!
With faith and diligence, they push back the darkness of your doubts and whispering thoughts!
With strength and fervour, they peel the skin from your face, claws alight with shining blood!
With rictus grins and toothless maws, they chase you down the halls of your childhood fears!
The great day has come! Run and hide!


Hastur, Archangel of Mammon, goads the sleeping god Danalin deeper and deeper into nightmare, birthing wonders and horrors into Erebus as the god's psyche and the waking world blend at the corners.
- Angels, Gods and Goats, by Luonnotar Gavin. 

When a denizen of Erebus lays eyes on the realm of the Dream, they see exactly what they believe.
A simple farmer can, with just their mind, impose new rules in the Dreaming, moulding it subconsciously into their own flawed idea of paradise. 
Like a depression in the sand left by an Antlion, it draws the farmer down deeper into the Dream, until the point where the farmer is convinced that this heaven of their own making is not only true, but also.... 

That right there, that moment, when the Dream is stretched taught like a snare, the branches and ground creeking as if yearning to slam shut with great thrashing jaws... The world begins tipping to the left, colours bleed out of the spectrum, and the farmer completes the thought: They want more!
The scale of the farmer's soul tips over into irredeemable greed and Kilmorphs' warm gaze turns cold. 
The Dream lunges, and their blood sprays over the soil of paradise, damning them to Mammon's vault.
- Runekeeper  Mathu Gal on the nature of esoteric entities.

You idiots say the Dreaming can not hurt you unless you let it in?!
That is a bloody dangerous misconception!
Listen to me, all of you! The Dream wants you, it needs you to make itself real...
But if, for whatever reason, you will not help it, then... the danger becomes very real very fast!
- Pylf Stern, Survivor of the Consuming of Gallowstone.</English>
