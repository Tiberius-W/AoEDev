Unrestricted Leaders option recommended
[desc]
Minister Koun is a master of disguise, he is so good in fact that he has assumed control of every civilization that has settled the plane Erebus!

Select one of his many faces to assume the civilization features and traits of his disguised civilization(or most of them...)
Select The Kounperor and be able to build Scion units and features as any civilization!
Select The Klouwn and be able to build Balseraph units and features as any civilization!
Select The Kount and be able to build Calabim units and features as any civilization!

You get the idea, go have fun!
(Use the custom game option "Unrestricted Leaders" if you wish to spread the kounsanity)
(No, it isn't balanced at all.)

(If your game crashes and this module is in your active modules list, the Devs are not going to help you fix your save)
