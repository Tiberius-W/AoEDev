[desc]
First tier of techs is slightly cheaper, tier 1.5 and 2 are the same, but the ramping per tier past that changes from 2x/tier to 2.5x.
The tech tree display (F6) is redone to place techs in their appropriate tiers.
In addition, tech diffusion effect is strongly increased from 10% max to 100% max (linear map from [met teams that have the tech] / [all possible teams]).

###

Changelog:

- 1.2 --Renamed to Widen Technology instead of Tech Exponentiation for load order compatability reasons (see 1.1).
      --Changed to superexponential tech cost tier progression; 2x, 2x, 2.5x, 2.5x, 3x, 3x, 4x from prior 2x -> 2.5x at tier 3.
      --Tweaked some of the mid-tier costs to be closer to each other.

- 1.1 --Moved dependency checking into vcivics, so that the user should load in any pass instead of specified order.
