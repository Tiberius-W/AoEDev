		<English>Abaddon began as a Father of Worlds, one of the Seven Aspects of Amathaon. These True Angels traveled out from the heart of creation and made infinite new lands as they passed. Though the raw form already existed, it was the Father of Worlds that turned the continents, oceans, mountains, etc., into living worlds complete with unique and wonderful creations.[PARAGRAPH]During the Godswar, Agares corrupted each of the Father of Worlds and turned them into the Unraveling. They lost all their Creation affinity and became Dark creatures said to be able to destroy creation.[PARAGRAPH]At the signing of the Compact, Agares bound Abaddon in a pit beneath the Underhome. In later ages the dwarven city of Vallum is built atop this pit and the Vigil of the Deep and the Umberguard was established to make sure Abbadon is never released.[PARAGRAPH]In the Age of Ruin Belphegor shall send Oriens to the underground city of Vallum to free Abbadon, but the Vigil of the Deep catches him and the Keeper of Keys executes Oriens before he can do so.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Asmoday was the eldest of Sallos's 34 children. His soul was consecrated to Agares while his mother pregnant with him. When he was seven years old he inherited a wealthy Patrian duchy following his father's early death, but soon everything fell to ruin. Blights struck the crops, plagues hit his people, trade relations soured. As he grew into a young man his duchy crumbled around him. It wasn't until Kylorin came to review the duchy and explained his latent ability that Asmoday felt like anything other than a failure. As a member of the Imprimatur Council he learned control for his power and the ability to focus it to tear people, armies and empires apart.[PARAGRAPH]Asmoday battled the Empyrean, broke Dies Diei, blinded the captured priests and then offered them as a gift to Alexis.[PARAGRAPH]He had an irrational hatred for elves, capturing, torturing and killing any he found. Rumors of "elven blood" in Dust citizens was often enough to get them killed. He was a member of the Coven of the Black Candle with Faeryl, but never would have participated if he had known she was there (and vise-versa since the elves knew what happened to them in his duchy and hated him for it).[PARAGRAPH]During the second revolution, revolutionaries came to Dust in response to rumors that a tax had been imposed, that every village would supply a child for demonic sacrifice. These revolutionaries (thousands of farmers and workers from across Patria with crude weapons) were crushed by trained soldiers, black magic and demonic spirits. The bodies were then set on long pikes and marched back to their home cities where they were displayed impaled at the village center. The town was gathered to curse and spit on the corpses of the revolutionaries, and any that didn't were impaled and put up on a pike beside them. Then each home village was ordered to select a child for sacrifice, and they all did. This was the end of the second revolution.[PARAGRAPH]In the third revolution Asmoday caused the Sanctus Inquisition to turn against Basium by ringing summoning circles with the innocent, that Basium would tear through in battle and hiding mages in villages that Basium would destroy to uncover. Ultimately Basium became more feared than the Imprimatur Council and the Inquisition nearly lost support for the civil war. Rather than risk openly opposing Basium (which they feared would lead to him turning on them) the Inquisition abandoned Basium in battle, and without the protection of the golden fire Asmoday and his mages defeated Basium. They would have killed him if Basium's twin Gyra hadn't pulled him from the battlefield and into the Otherworld.[PARAGRAPH]Following the defeat of Basium, Kylorin went alone to face Asmoday. Within that battle Kylorin was faced with every evil action he had performed, every life he had carelessly ruined, a legacy of pain he had submitted the world to. By the end, Asmoday was dead. But Kylorin was also finished with war. The only battle he fought in the Patrian civil war after that was against Henri Ghouls, who Kylorin wouldn't kill.[PARAGRAPH]After Asmoday's death his followers entombed his corpse on the Isle of Scorpions. The isle was once green and full of life but after burying Asmoday there, all life died or fled and the isle itself started slipping into the sea. A few decades after his burial a shipwreck occurred nearby and the survivors swam to the island. It would have been better for them to die at sea. They quickly turned on each other and within a few days they were all dead. Sometimes their spirits can still be seen wandering the island, especially during storms.[PARAGRAPH]After his death the Daughters of Saleos summoned the soul of Asmoday and bound it to a skull carved from a Zabulus horn. It is known as the Skull of Asmoday and it is their most prized relic and a powerful source of entropy magic.[PARAGRAPH]Asmoday was buried with his Mask of the Coven of the Black Candle. But during the Age of Invention his grave was dug up, the mask was stolen and used to steal the Heart of Fire.</English>

As a member of the Imprimatur Council he learned control for his power and the ability to focus it to tear people, armies and empires apart.[PARAGRAPH]Asmoday battled the Empyrean, broke Dies Diei, blinded the captured priests and then offered them as a gift to Alexis.[PARAGRAPH]He had an irrational hatred for elves, capturing, torturing and killing any he found. Rumors of "elven blood" in Dust citizens was often enough to get them killed. He was a member of the Coven of the Black Candle with Faeryl, but never would have participated if he had known she was there (and vise-versa since the elves knew what happened to them in his duchy and hated him for it).[PARAGRAPH]During the second revolution, revolutionaries came to Dust in response to rumors that a tax had been imposed, that every village would supply a child for demonic sacrifice. These revolutionaries (thousands of farmers and workers from across Patria with crude weapons) were crushed by trained soldiers, black magic and demonic spirits. The bodies were then set on long pikes and marched back to their home cities where they were displayed impaled at the village center. The town was gathered to curse and spit on the corpses of the revolutionaries, and any that didn't were impaled and put up on a pike beside them. Then each home village was ordered to select a child for sacrifice, and they all did. This was the end of the second revolution.[PARAGRAPH]In the third revolution Asmoday caused the Sanctus Inquisition to turn against Basium by ringing summoning circles with the innocent, that Basium would tear through in battle and hiding mages in villages that Basium would destroy to uncover. Ultimately Basium became more feared than the Imprimatur Council and the Inquisition nearly lost support for the civil war. Rather than risk openly opposing Basium (which they feared would lead to him turning on them) the Inquisition abandoned Basium in battle, and without the protection of the golden fire Asmoday and his mages defeated Basium. They would have killed him if Basium's twin Gyra hadn't pulled him from the battlefield and into the Otherworld.[PARAGRAPH]Following the defeat of Basium, Kylorin went alone to face Asmoday. Within that battle Kylorin was faced with every evil action he had performed, every life he had carelessly ruined, a legacy of pain he had submitted the world to. By the end, Asmoday was dead. But Kylorin was also finished with war. The only battle he fought in the Patrian civil war after that was against Henri Ghouls, who Kylorin wouldn't kill.[PARAGRAPH]After Asmoday's death his followers entombed his corpse on the Isle of Scorpions. The isle was once green and full of life but after burying Asmoday there, all life died or fled and the isle itself started slipping into the sea. A few decades after his burial a shipwreck occurred nearby and the survivors swam to the island. It would have been better for them to die at sea. They quickly turned on each other and within a few days they were all dead. Sometimes their spirits can still be seen wandering the island, especially during storms.[PARAGRAPH]After his death the Daughters of Saleos summoned the soul of Asmoday and bound it to a skull carved from a Zabulus horn. It is known as the Skull of Asmoday and it is their most prized relic and a powerful source of entropy magic.[PARAGRAPH]Asmoday was buried with his Mask of the Coven of the Black Candle. But during the Age of Invention his grave was dug up, the mask was stolen and used to steal the Heart of Fire.</Italian>
		<Spanish>[TAB]Asmoday was the eldest of Sallos's 34 children. His soul was consecrated to Agares while his mother pregnant with him. When he was seven years old he inherited a wealthy Patrian duchy following his father's early death, but soon everything fell to ruin. Blights struck the crops, plagues hit his people, trade relations soured. As he grew into a young man his duchy crumbled around him.
