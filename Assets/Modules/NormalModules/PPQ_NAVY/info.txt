Fall Further/Rise from Erebus/Ashes of Erebus/Final Fixes Reborn is a mod that has gone through even more modifications than it has names. And one inevitable and regrettable result of this development is that as units changed and civilizations were added he number of unique models has not been keeping pace. I have taken it upon my self to correct this. Or at least to die trying.
