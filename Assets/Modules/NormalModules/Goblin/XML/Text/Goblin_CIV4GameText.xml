Most of these games started as simple games that the Lukos encourage their youths to play, but some are becoming full fledged sports with increasingly firm and ritualized rules.  The effect on Lukos military units has been positive as well, as the most recent generation of Lukos are naturally talented. This may be the best moment for you to step into the situation.</English>
