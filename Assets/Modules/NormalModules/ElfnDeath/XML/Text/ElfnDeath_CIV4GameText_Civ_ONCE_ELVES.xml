		<English>Haerlond's home was similar to the others.  He didn't allow himself a different lifestyle just because he was the cities ruler.  Varn told the children to wait outside and he went in alone.
	Haerlond was relaxing in a deep scarlet chair.  The Otherworld had always muted their emotions, keeping them in a comfortable stupor, but Haerlond found it difficult to control his emotions here.  His anger and concerns ate away at him.  Sitting in this chair was one of the few things that relaxed him.
	But Varn burst in, obviously on the verge of a fight.  Before Varn had even spoken Haerlond already found himself wondering how much better life would be without his idealistic brother hounding him.
	"Did you give Waldrun the right to perform the taghairm ritual on Talia?" Varn asked.
	Haerlond took a deep breath, he knew this fight was coming but hadn't expected it this soon.
	"Yes," Haerlond answered, "We sent hunters after the woman the children described.  But with that much of a lead we will likely never find her.  And we still don't know how Gosea got the Heartstone to begin with.  If Talia gave it to her, if they were working together, then Talia may know where Gosea is going.  We cannot give up that opportunity."
	"You would kill a woman on the chance that she may know something, with no evidence that she has done anything wrong?" Varn asked, his voice rising so loud that the children could hear him outside.
	"To recover the Heartstone and to protect our people. Yes I would." Haerlond said trying to remain calm.
	Varn stormed out of the room and back outside to where the children waited.
	"What do we do now?" Dain asked.
	Varn opened his hand to show the jail key he had taken from Haerlond's house.
	"You cannot stay here." Varn said, "I am going to free Talia, I cannot let her be killed by my people.  But it will be difficult, maybe impossible, to get her out of the Well without the Ostaurii stopping us.  And after coming from the Otherworld, they won't let you leave.  You should run now for the Well's exit.  The Ostaurii will be after Talia and I.  At the very least that should distract them from your escape."
	"No." Dain said, "we stay together."
	Kirien was just as adamant, as were Auric and Lyrr.  Seeing there was little use in arguing with them, and that it was wasting valuable time, Varn ran toward the jail and the children followed.
	Arriving at the jail they found two of the Ostaurii still standing guard.  Varn brushed past them and entered the jail with the children behind him.
	Inside Talia looked surprised to see them.
	"The children shouldn't be here," she began.  But Varn interrupted her.
	"We are all leaving." he said, "This cannot continue."
	But he paused with the key in the cell's lock.  Dain understood exactly what he was thinking.  He was considering giving up his home, his family, to save the life of someone he didn't even really know.  He would be sacrificing everything to do the right thing.  It was the same choice Dain made in the Otherworld.
	Then he turned the key and the cell door opened.
	"Auric, can you distract the guards?" Varn asked, taking Talia's hand and leading her out of the cell.
	Auric opened the door just enough to see the guards standing outside.  He looked around and listened for anything he could use as a weapon.  There was the portal, though he was scared to make contact with the spirit beyond it again.  And there was the fire on the top of the Tower of Calling.  As with all fire it was eager and ready to consume.  Auric could feel its hunger, its hatred of the metal grill that confined it and he had a plan.
	"Are we ready?" Auric asked, looking back at everyone.  They nodded in response.
	Reaching out Auric felt the fire and pulled it toward him, willed it jump off of the tower and into the yard before the jail like a meteor.  The fire flickered dangerously as he reached out to it, he could feel it being pulled toward him.  The guards noticed the fires movements and looked up at it in alarm.
	Then as Auric focused, with one great mental pull the flame simply disappeared.  The light was gone and Auric lost any connection he had with it.  He had destroyed the fire.
	Though that wasn't what he had planned, the effect worked.  The yard outside of the jail darkened and the guards rushed the top of the Malachite Palace, believing the extinguishing of the fire to be some sort of attack.
	It would be as good of a distraction as they could get and they all ran out of the jail and away from Barathrum, toward the path along the Well's rim that would lead out.
	They ran as hard as they could, though their muscles ached and their lungs burned, past the limits of their endurance.  But the Well of Shadows was huge and they weren't even halfway across to the path when they heard the chariots coming for them.
	As before, two of the Ostaurii manned each chariot, and each was pulled by an ethereal stag.  They raced easily across the soft ground.  And as they got closer, when it became obvious that they would never get away Varn turned and ordered the others to continue running.
	But they all stopped and readied weapons.
	Kirien's mother had forced her onto the rowboat during Brigdarrow's attack.  She still felt guilty that she hadn't stayed to help fight the goblins.  She would not run away again, and she drew her knife and stood beside Dain.
	Talia reached down into the soft earth.  She prayed, asking for favors from the world she worshipped.  This place was so unlike the natural world that existed outside the Well, she was almost powerless here.  But there was some spirit of Erebus even here, and her prayers caused sharp stones to poke up through the soil between them and the charging chariots.
	Waldrun and Haerlond were with the Ostaurii.  And Haerlond's orders were clear, they were to be killed, even Varn.  An order Waldrun happily passed on to his men.

		<English>Waldrun - Commander of the Ostaurii, Council to the Princes of the Well of Shadow.
		
		
		
		There were easily a dozen of the Ostaurii atop the palace, and several others positioned midway up the stairs on each side.  They watched Dain and Kirien climb the palace without comment, and Dain had the impression they weren't here to guard anyone from going into the archway, but to protect against anything that might come out.
	Waldrun was also atop the palace speaking to the Ostaurii, but they grew quiet when Dain and Kirien got close.  The palace was the highest point in the city, matched only by the flame from the Tower of Calling that was close enough to cast the top of the palace in yellow hues.  They could see the pale white glow of the library from here, but the rest of the city was shrouded in darkness.
	"Were you looking for something?" Waldrun asked.
	"No," Dain answered nervously "Varn said that we were free to explore the city and it's very. beautiful.  We have only seen our village before, never anything like this."
	Kirien was even more nervous and didn't like the way Waldrun was regarding the two of them.  He seemed to be thinking, but his eyes had no warmth in them.  He reminded her of a butcher considering slaughtering either the chicken or the pig for Beltane dinner.  Waldrun noticed her nervousness and smiled, though it only made him look more sinister.
	Dain turned to go back down the stairs, but Waldrun stopped him with a comment.
	"Your father is on the other side of that archway."
	Dain froze, Kirien found herself suddenly afraid.  She grabbed Dain's sleeve to force him to continue walking down the stairs with her, but he wouldn't move.
	"Is the Otherworld through that portal?" Dain asked turning to look at the archway.
	"Yes," Waldrun answered again with that creepy smile, "It leads to Arawn's realm and to the spirits of all men who are unclaimed by the gods."
	"Do you have to be dead to enter the Otherworld?"
	Waldrun laughed, it was hollow raspy sound.  Kirien's tugs became more urgent, but Dain continued to ignore her.
	"No, that is where we all came from." Waldrun said, "We entered the Otherworld many centuries ago, before the rise and fall of Mulcarn, before the shattering of the human nations.  We lived unageing and undying in the Otherworld.  Varn and Haerlond were boys, younger even than you, when we entered and they remained so until we came here and started aging again.  I fear they may forever remain as boys in spirit."
	Dain walked over to the archway.  It was a simple green arch with a moth symbol inscribed in it.  There wasn't any indication that it was special or that stepping through it would lead you anywhere but on the other side of the palace's top.
	"Why did you leave the Otherworld?" Dain asked.
	Waldrun shrugged, "We were unable to have children inside the Otherworld.  And as pleasant as life was there, it was muted compared to normal life.  The Otherworld is a place of relaxing and calm, a place to dream and allow the centuries to slip by unnoticed.  But there was little passion either in sadness or joy.  We came here so that we might truly live."
	Dain nodded absently, straining to see anything through the empty air of the portal.
	"You may go through if you want." Waldrun said, almost at a whisper.
	The Ostaurii exchanged alarmed glances at this, but none spoke.
	"Dain," Kirien pleaded, "we have to get back.  Let's go talk to Varn and see if we can help get Talia out of jail."
	But when Dain turned to look at her Kirien already knew it was hopeless.
	"Go back to Auric," Dain said somberly, "I have to see my father again.  I will ask him what we should do.  And I will tell your mother that you love her."
	Tears welled up in Kirien's eyes. "No." she pleaded.
	But it was useless.  Dain turned and walked through the archway.  As he stepped through he disappeared.  A low whining sound, like two stones grinding together, accompanied his disappearance and the fire atop the Tower of Calling flickered dangerously.
	Kirien briefly considered chasing after him, but as non-descript as the simple stone archway was it radiated such a presence of antiquity and ending that it terrified her.  Waldrun turned his creepy smile on Kirien, and she ran down the stairs in tears.

		<French>Waldrun - Commander of the Ostaurii, Council to the Princes of the Well of Shadow.
		
		
	There were easily a dozen of the Ostaurii atop the palace, and several others positioned midway up the stairs on each side.  They watched Dain and Kirien climb the palace without comment, and Dain had the impression they weren't here to guard anyone from going into the archway, but to protect against anything that might come out.
	Waldrun was also atop the palace speaking to the Ostaurii, but they grew quiet when Dain and Kirien got close.  The palace was the highest point in the city, matched only by the flame from the Tower of Calling that was close enough to cast the top of the palace in yellow hues.  They could see the pale white glow of the library from here, but the rest of the city was shrouded in darkness.
	"Were you looking for something?" Waldrun asked.
	"No," Dain answered nervously "Varn said that we were free to explore the city and it's very. beautiful.  We have only seen our village before, never anything like this."
	Kirien was even more nervous and didn't like the way Waldrun was regarding the two of them.  He seemed to be thinking, but his eyes had no warmth in them.  He reminded her of a butcher considering slaughtering either the chicken or the pig for Beltane dinner.  Waldrun noticed her nervousness and smiled, though it only made him look more sinister.
	Dain turned to go back down the stairs, but Waldrun stopped him with a comment.

		<English>The Elves of the Well of Shadow are a band of former mercenaries who served in Laroth's underworld campaign to obtain the Opalus Mortis from Arawn.

Over the years, the relations between the Once Elves and Laroth began to sour as the Once Elves came to recognize Laroth for the malevolent force he was. 
Seeking to buy his people time to escape, their leader Arak The Erkling stayed behind and drew Laroth's ire onto himself as his people, led by his sons Haerlond and Varn Gosam, withdrew through the Well of Shadow.

Now they stand vigil over this gateway to the Underworld in case Laroth ever returned to seek his revenge... 
And though most of them hope that day would never come,  Waldrun the Necromancer quietly hopes to return to the service of Laroth....

One day, The Heartstone was stolen from them by a Shaeim cultist known as 'Gosea the Dwindling'. Driven to desperation in the effort to retrieve the stone, Haerlond gave Waldrun permission to perform the dark necromantic ritual of taghairm on a suspect of the theft to gather information. On hearing the news, Varn was horrified by the notion that his own brother would resort to such extreme measures and sought to help the suspect and other prisoners(Auric Ulvin amongst them) flee from his people.

During the attempted escape, Auric used his latent magical power to break the veil protecting the Well of Shadows, bathing the Once Elves in blazing light and blinding them while Varn, gifted with a vision of Lugus, led most of the prisoners to safety.</English>
