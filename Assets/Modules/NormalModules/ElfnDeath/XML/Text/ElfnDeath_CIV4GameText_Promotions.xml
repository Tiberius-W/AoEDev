		<English>Those with a minor affinity often make great investigators. They can often sense places where people have died, and people or items that have taken lives. They can detect information from a corpse, often including the last things they experienced before death. Most cultures view manipulating death as immoral, so many practitioners avoid that.

                 No one is born with death affinity. Instead it is found in those that suffer some traumatic event early in life. Those gifted in this dominion are generally barren. Many practitioners use the ability to manipulate death to create perversions of the dead, but moral practitioners can be just as powerful. These two groups often war with each other</English>
