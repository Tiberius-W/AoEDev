		<English>	They stopped in front of the library, a round stone building with a single set of wide doors and no windows.  The top of the library was a dome fitted with pieces of clear quartz, and a diffuse light radiated out from inside the building.
	Varn squinted before opening the door and warned everyone to shield their eyes.  Inside a massive silver chandelier hung.  The chandelier was covered with the glowing fungus and it bathed the entire library in a dim white light.  Mirrors were set in the walls at the height of the chandelier and reflected the light down into the library.  The clear quartz dome allowed some of the light from the sky and the city to slip through.
	It took Varn several seconds to adjust to the light in the library.  For the rest it was the first time since entering the Well of Shadows that they could see clearly.  The library could hardly be considered bright, but it was enough to read by.
	Beneath the quartz dome and the circle of mirrors, shelves full of books filled the room.  To Auric, Kirien and Dain it seemed like an amazing collection.  Lyrr wasn't as impressed.
	"This is small compared to the library at Cerrolan, and Cerrolan isn't a large elven city.  Why do people come to study here?" Lyrr asked.
	Varn led them to two small bedrooms right off of the libraries main chamber while answering, "These tomes are from the land of the dead, many of Erebus's most important writers died before finishing their greatest works.  Here we have those works, finished in Arawn's realm and available for study."
	"Can we read them?" Auric asked.
	Varn nodded, "It may be months before the next traveler arrives, we will ask that you work in the orchards and help fetch water while you are here.  But outside of that you can read what you like.  There is a washroom and I will see if I can find you some clean clothes."</English>

	Dain answered, "We are the only survivors from the Illian village of Brigdarrow, it was destroyed by goblins.  This was the closest settlement to our village, we came to find shelter and help."
	The blond elf spoke, "We saw the procession of your people and the goblins that fell in the attack as they drifted from your world, through this luminal place and into Arawn's realm.  Know that they went without impediment and doubtless have found their peaceful rest."
