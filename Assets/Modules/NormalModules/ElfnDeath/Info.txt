[desc]
- Death Sphere is now split into Death and Undeath. Undeath is the old undead summoning school and

(New) Death is all about restoring the balance by putting the undead to rest (can not be learned by D'tesh).

- New spells are: Fated End T1 spell that counters Combat Withdrawal, Last Rite T2 spell that buffs death damage and damage vs Undead,

Deathward T3 spell protects against all death damage, and Arawn's Embrace locks Undeath users out of their summons for a time.

- Once Elves gain the innate ability for Mist to spread to any forest under their cultural control, giving them a new defensive option and, as always with elves, some reason to care about trees.

- The Once Elf unit Waldrun has the unique ability to harness all of the spells from the sphere of death.

- Once Elves Unique Buildings.

- Added Waldrun as a leader with new emergent trait focused on binding souls for Laroth.
