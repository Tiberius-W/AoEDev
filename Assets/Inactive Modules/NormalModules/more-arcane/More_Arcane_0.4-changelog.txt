Fixed (Hopefully) Mounted Adept/Mage promotions not being correctly removed when Mounted Mage/Archmage promotions were applied.

0.2 - 23 March '14
Lots of changes:
-Players can now only have on Mounted Archmage or varient thereof
-Malakim players can now switch between Camel and Horse mounts
-Hippus' Horselord promotion now grants -5 to miscast magic
-Amurite Kylorin's Legacy now grants -10 to miscast magic
-Primary and Secondary unitcombats have been switched. Before the MA units were Arcane, Mounted applied by Promotion. Now with the two changed around, Amurite units upgrading to non-arcane Mounted units (Horsemen, etc) have been fixed.
-Sheaim Eater of Dreams can now be upgraded to a Mounted Archmage
-Mekara Order Shapers and High Mages can now be upgraded into MA Units - they do not gain special versions

Three new promotions added. Automatically applied to new mounted arcane units.
One is an M'd Adept debuff, superceded by the M'd Mage on upgrade.
M'd Archmage promo does not debuff, but does remove the M'd Mage.
