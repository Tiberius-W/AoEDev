Hi ^^, thanks for checking.

First things first, this module started from my desire to "balance" Vcivics but it morphed into this .. As such design was focused around how I like to play. If you want my intended experience I would suggest turning on:
• End of Winter
• Barbarian World
• Play on Epic or Marathon speed
I put some thought into how the civs might emerge from the Age of Ice and shaped the starter civics as such. Very survival oriented.
|
Second secondly, a bunch of the stuff in this module is very experimental like "cultural affinities" and alternative commanders. Mostly because I thought it was a cool way to widen gameplay and strategy options. If you got cool ideas that are supported by existing DLLs let me know.
|
Charming thirdly, here is the feature list:
• Changes to almost every civic
• Alternative commanders for thematic government administrations
• Cultures giving affinities to unites
• Cultures impacting specialists perfomance differently
• Civic exclusive buildings and unites
• Niche submechanics for specific civics
• AI-free Art
