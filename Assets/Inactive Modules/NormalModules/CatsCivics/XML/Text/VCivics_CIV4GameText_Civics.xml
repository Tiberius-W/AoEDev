"It's easy to fall into the pitfall of a powerful elite. People that excel should be rewarded. The rewards serve not only as acknowledgement but also as support so the family can focus on honing their skills and passing them on. The passing on of both skills and rewards in conjunction with society supporting rather then competing with the now forming dynasties creates a self serving cycle of further entrenchment."

Strategy: Aristocracy is a defensive and cultural civic. The powerful nobles are motivated to defend their lands and to promote their prestige through patronage of promising artists.</English>

		<English>The first cracks in the ice brought a mix of fear and hope. Generations had known only the glacial expanse, a world of white and biting wind. Now, with the melt, whispers of the Ages Prior grew louder. Ancient tales spoke of lush lands and forgotten knowledge, treasures buried beneath the thaw. The tribe, once huddled against the cold, now looked outwards, their hearts a mix of apprehension and a burning desire to reclaim what was lost. The future lay in the past, and the melting ice was their key.</English>

Now, as the ice recedes, our tribe doesn't look to reclaim the past through conquest, but through cooperation.

		<English>"In this world reclaimed from the cold hardships, why not embrace the warmth of pleasure? Hedonism is not mere indulgence, but a celebration of life's fleeting beauty-finding joy amidst the ruins and savouring each moment as a precious gift in our new era. These moments of pleasure are our rebellion, our defiance against despair, and the foundation upon which we can rebuild a vibrant, joyful future."</English>

		<English>The remnants of our Tribe move cautiously across the landscape, their ragged figures cloaked in patchwork furs and scavenged hides. Once scattered in the icy wastes, they now gather around emerging settlements, crumbling ruins and forsaken outposts, where faint signs of civilization flicker like dying stars. Hunters track the emerging wildlife. Mammoths, snow wolves, deer's, bears and what every survived the prior age.</English>
