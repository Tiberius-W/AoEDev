[shortdesc]
Adds important leader options for most civs, generally leaving 1 leader as historic. Civs with only 1 leader like austrin converted to important, too.
[desc]
Changes each following leader to important with one trait, listed as follows. Capria still has aspect of war, it is just flagged as a civ trait so she can earn 2 personality traits. Casin changed to match other importants.
Some I picked purely to offset the historical choices - sheelba is organized since jonas is aggressive, mahala is trader since charadon is warlike, cassin is philosophical because hannah is financial.

- Amurites - Valledia [Charismatic]
- Archos - Veraato [Arcane]
- Bannor - Capria [Industrious]
- Calabim - Kind of think Mahon the Butcher with tyrant trait is weird enough so they get a 'normal one', Flauros [Financial]
- Chislev - Natane [Organized]
- Clan of Embers - Sheelba [Organized]
- Doviello - Mahala [Traders]
- Khazad - Kandros Fir [Financial]
- Lanun - Cassin loses financial
- Luchuirp - Letigo changes because aggressive is lame on golem faction, spiritual at least lets you lean into your religous units and is not 'wasted' [Spiritual]
- Scions - Korinna [Aggressive]
