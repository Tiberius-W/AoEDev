MoM Buildings 1.0 - 22 Mar '14
Arcane Forge and Hell Stables merged
Updated to work with Ashes of Erebus

Hell Stable 0.11 - 23 Feb '11
Added Hippus-specificness.
Thanks to Valkrionn for explaining how it works.

Hell Stable 0.10 - 23 Feb '11
Idea borrowed from Master of Mana
Hell Stable building, providing 2 Nightmares.
Made a National Wonder to prevent over-use.
For now, we're using the standard Stable art.
Requires the Infernal Pact technology.
May make Hippus-specific in a later version.
It works! Enjoy!
