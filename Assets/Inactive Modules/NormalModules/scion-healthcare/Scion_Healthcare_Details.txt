  I got tired of all the useless health buildings in my build queue as Scions of Patria. I know they are there so you can combat Unhealthy Discontent before Sorcery, but their names still annoy me. 
  Why would Scions have an infirmary? Just die already and accept the Emperors Gift. 
  Why waste effort on building a Granary, just starve and accept the Emperors Gift. 
  Why an Elder Council when every single citizen in the empire is older than other civilizations?
  So I replaced the health buildings with unique buildings, intended to have about the same value to a Scion player as the original buildings have to a regular civ.
