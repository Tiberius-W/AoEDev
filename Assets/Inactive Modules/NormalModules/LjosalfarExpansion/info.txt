v1.1 (FoxXavier)
Added in food/production bonus for forest/ancient
Removed Dexterous promo, strengthed range attack of archer units.
Added in stealth for ranger/beastmaster
Changed Archer, Horse Archer, and Recon lines

V1.1a (FoxXavier)
Fixing Beastmaster not being available (Thanks to Aledeth for reporting)

V1.2 (FoxXavier)
Added in a variant for Amelanchier with a new emergent trait

V1.3 (FoxXavier)
Reverting the forest bonuses in the design doc. As per playtesting and feedback, seems way too strong. Unsure if needed at all.

V1.4 (FoxXavier)
Cities now spawn with an ancient forest. Thanks to wuxiangjinxing for the suggestion and help with code.
V1.4b (FoxXavier) Minor fix to make sure the new unit class is unique.
V1.4c (FoxXavier) Minor fix to the text file, one of the entries was named incorrectly. (Thanks to wuxiangjinxing for pointing it out)

v1.5 (FoxXavier)
Adding in secondary archer to Fyrdwell units (Suggestion from DagothGares)
Adding in a marksman replacement, changing up some unit stats/names, changing elven trait to be more defensive.
Fixing an issue with the homeland promo in the mod.
