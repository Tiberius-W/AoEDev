An alternate set of upgrades for Gimil. Requires Craftsmaster 2, so you won't open a game with these available, and these completely replace the old defense platings.

Law - Enhanced Patrol Routines (guardsman)
Life - Banishing Blades (converted holy strength, bonus against undead)
Mind - Improved Cognition (+1 first strike)
Sun - Truth Lenses (bonus perception and vision, but will probably get changed to an aura in future)
Force - Suppression Field (spell to apply slow, target stack affects 6 units, will probably get changed to slow aura in the future). Remember that slow counters withdraw, too!
Nature - Taming Nets (capture animals + animal/beast bonus)
Air - Lightning Charged Coils (converted lightning strength + small collateral damage)
Earth - Heavy Frame (-movement but +defense and can bombard city defenses, with only a small 5%, like bezeri spell [currently doesn't have bombard because i don't know python stuff])
Fire - Flamespewers (converted fire strength, +city attack, -defense)
Water - Hydro-Traversal (can move on water, doubled movement on coast)
Chaos - Scything Blade Attatchments (bonus against melee and forests)
Shadow - Displacement Field (first strike immunity + bonus against archers)
Metamagic - Magic-Proof Plating (elemental resistance + spell resistance)

Creation - [was going to be auto heal, but you get that for craftmaster 3, need ideas]
Spirit - [looking for suggestions]
Ice - [looking for suggestions]

Some further thoughts from me:
Numbers open to criticism
100% open to lore criticisms or name suggestions - maybe patrol routines and improved cognition are too sci-fi? Also feel free to suggest swaps as to what mana does what, if you've got a good thematic fit or good idea
Didn't do one of each mana, focused mostly on the non-necromancy mana. Left chaos in because it would be very funny to build a bunch of scything blade golems to go chop the elves out of their forests.
