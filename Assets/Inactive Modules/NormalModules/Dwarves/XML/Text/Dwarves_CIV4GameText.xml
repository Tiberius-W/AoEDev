		<English>Forgeguards require the Aristocracy civic to build, and will leave you if you change civics--so don't bother building them if you plan to change government civics soon. They are very nice units if you meet the requirements, however, as they protect stacks against enemies with Marksman promotion and they can cast the Hope spell to add happiness and culture to a city. Whilst slightly weaker than Royal Guards of other nations the Forgeguards connection to stone has given them the abilty to turn their skin to stone for a short period of time.</English>
