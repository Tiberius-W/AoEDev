		<English>Anscarca is an experimental civilization that changes up many mechanics which I will try to outline below.
[H2]Core Civilization Changes[\H2]
[ICON_BULLET]No commercial. All research must come from specialists. Gold is set to 10 each turn to remove any buildup. Known issue: Civic costs aren't completely negatiated so you could lose units if you choose ones with upkeep. Base mod folder has a handicap file that can possibily overcome this issue but not fully tested and only has settings for a noble equivelent.
[ICON_BULLET]Units (Lurkers/Monstrosities/Overseers) grow in strength with population. Tower of Dreams and City of a Thousand Slums are both powerful due to an extra radius. Sacrifice the Weak likewise but Anscarca gets hurt from AC so it's a risk/reward balance.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_VIRAL_LINK_ANSCARCA]Viral Link[\LINK] is how all Anscarca units are connected. This will cause unhealthy in cities so try to limit amount of city defenders. Non-native units will have it [LINK=PROMOTION_SOUL_CORRUPTION_ANSCARCA]forceably[\LINK] added.
[ICON_BULLET]Default "settings" have been heavily changed as per the Viral Link. Experience is very slow to gain, are weak against taking cities, reduced regen, and have no vision by default. However, there are special promotions on creation and then with level/age that allow the unit to choose specializations.
[ICON_BULLET]Recyclable units, all can be converted to "workers" although Swarmlings only have a chance.
[ICON_BULLET]Quick initial pop growth with grassland/plains but slow/decreases as things turn into wasteland. Needs upgraded improvements.
[ICON_BULLET]Endless Promotions. Certain promotions can be stacked although generally are very specialized where they reduce stats that they don't boost. Careful about taking these
[ICON_BULLET]Gene Optimization. As the Anscarca continues to gain experience from age, defeating enemies, recyling units, and conducting gene optimization rituals, free promotions will be given to new units once threasholds are met (100, 400, 900, etc). 

[H2]Leader/Trait Overview[\H2]

[ICON_BULLET]Conquest: Traits for aggression and expansion, starts with extra lurkers
[ICON_BULLET]Adaptive: Flexibility in traits. Gets an additional lurker, fever, swarm and workers at start.
[ICON_BULLET]Infestation: Heavy early game focus but might struggle late game. Gives up research speed and military production for a large increase in free spawn rate, extra city at start, free swarms, and extra worker per new city.
[ICON_BULLET]Doomsday: Late game focused. No starting bonuses. Gets a free game ender unit(s) mid/late game and bonus to gene optimization ritual to allow for better scaling.
[ICON_BULLET]Pandemic: This trait focuses on the rogue/recon lines. Instead of free lurker spawns, you will get fevers. Also, each kill builds up a bonus against that race (or just a generic strength bonus if that unit doesn't have a race).

[H2]Religion Changes[\H2]

Adopting a religion will give a chance to add these promotions to units on build/spawn
[ICON_BULLET]Fellowship of Leaves: [LINK=PROMOTION_WOODSMAN1]Woodsman I[\LINK] and [LINK=PROMOTION_SUBDUE_ANIMAL]Subdue Animal[\LINK]
[ICON_BULLET]The Order: [LINK=PROMOTION_INQUISITOR]Inquisitor[\LINK] and [LINK=PROMOTION_LIFE1]Life I[\LINK]

[ICON_BULLET]Council of Esus: [LINK=PROMOTION_HIDDEN_NATIONALITY]Hidden Nationality[\LINK]

[ICON_BULLET]The Order: [LINK=BUILDING_THE_BETRAYAL]The Betrayal[\LINK]

[ICON_BULLET]Council of Esus: N/A (Future patch to maybe give access to council specific promos)
[ICON_BULLET]White Hand: [LINK=BUILDING_FROZEN_STORAGE]Frozen Storage[\LINK]

[H2]Improvements[\H2]
Most consume the worker but are built instantly. Here's the major new ones.
[ICON_BULLET]Bore - Hammer focused, will remove mountains/hills
[ICON_BULLET]Farm - Food focused, can be built on water
[ICON_BULLET]Node - Built by Monstrosity/Herald, does not consume the unit. Allows Anscarca to aggressively spread borders although leaves your Monstrosity exposed for a few turns when constructing

[H2]Units[\H2]

Basic Units:
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_GROWTH_ANSCARCA]Growth[\LINK]: Worker replacement. Sacrifices to instantly build improvements
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_OVERSEER_ANSCARCA]Overseers[\LINK]: These are your fort commanders and city cores. Do NOT let a city overseer die unless you want to lose the city. Gains additional strength for city population over 10.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_WHISPER]Whisper[\LINK]: An invisible immortal scout hero. Note: Death will remove any acquired promotions from events/dungeons. 
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_LURKER]Lurkers[\LINK]: These units are spawned randomly from cities. They are invisible inside borders. Will gain additional base strength with metal weapons and every 20 population.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_SWARMLINGS]Swarmlings[\LINK]: These come in triplets although the firstborn will be stronger. They have numbers but not power. Good for scouting or infecting disease/light damage.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_FEVER]Fever[\LINK]: Mobile assassin. Strikes hard then needs a few turns to recover stealth and strike. Can gain deadly disease promotion to weaken your enemies.

Game-ending Units (Extreme build cost but powerful stats)
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_MONSTROSITY_ANSCARCA]Monstrosity[\LINK]: Elite Destroyers. Best city offense of any Anscarca unit, comes with bombard, high offense stat that increases with city population. [LINK=PROMOTION_FLESH_ARTILLERY_ANSCARCA]Flesh Artillerty[\LINK] gives a long ranged option if you prefer picking off your enemies from a distance.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_DOOM_HERALD_ANSCARCA]Doom Herald[\LINK]: Your mages of doom. Coming with twincast and channeling I,II,III (except initial unit). With the starting diaster promotion, they are able to spam out fevers to inflict disease/damage on enemies. Note: Cost increases for each one on the field.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_PLAGUE]Plague[\LINK]: Extremely mobile assassin with blitz and scaling off life mana. With enough time, these will become a complete [LINK=PROMOTION_CALAMITY_GRADE_ANSCARCA]calamity[\LINK] for your enemies.


[H2]Promotions/Spells[\H2]
Not a full list but highlighting some of the faction specific ones that should be considered

City Level
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=SPELL_OUTBREAK_ANSCARCA]Outbreak[\LINK] Worldspell that spawns Fevers/Plagues in each city. By default, this will only spawn a single fever but will spawn an extra fever for each 10 pop and plague for each 50 pop.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=SPELL_PLANETEXTRACTION_ANSCARCA]Planet Extractor[\LINK] is a city spell that allows you to exploit the planet for a large amount of production (Example: [LINK=BUILDINGCLASS_PLANETARY_EXTRACTOR_ANSCARCA_8]Extractor VIII[\LINK]) and discover ore resources ([LINK=BUILDINGCLASS_RESOURCE_CAVERN_ANSCARCA]Bronze[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDINGCLASS_LAVAFLOW_ANSCARCA]Iron[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDINGCLASS_LIFE_VEIN_ANSCARCA]Mithril[\LINK]). Just be warned that this comes at an increasing cost of AC increase, population, unrest, hell/improvement destruction, and chance of war with your neighbors.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=SPELL_CREATE_LURKER_LAIR_ANSCARCA]Create[\LINK]/[LINK=SPELL_REMOVE_LURKER_LAIR_ANSCARCA]Remove[\LINK] Lurker Lair allows you to control the spawning of Lurkers (free melee units).

Unit Promotions
[ICON_BULLET]All combat units are given three starting promotion options and then additional 6,4,2 options at age/level 50/5,150/10,400/20.
[TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_HUNTER_ANSCARCA]Hunter[\LINK] line specialize in aggression with bonuses to regen per turn outside of terrority, attack bonuses, and experience per kill.
[TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_OBSERVER_ANSCARCA]Observer[\LINK] line specialize in scouting with ability to see further, detect invisible, experience per turn, and withdrawal chance.
[TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_GUARDIAN_ANSCARCA]Guardian[\LINK] line specialize in protection of the Anscarca Terrority with wasteland bonus, defense, and healing in friendly lands.
[TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_STALKER_ANSCARCA]Stalker[\LINK] line specialize in stealth with the first promotion giving invisible to any unit (enhanced stealth to those already invisible) and then removing the revealed penalty at the second tier.
[TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_SEER_ANSCARCA]Seer[\LINK] offers the unit a random chance to gain a powerful vision buff revealing any invisible units and becoming immune to first strike/defensive strike for a turn.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_IMMORTAL_ANSCARCA]Immortal[\LINK]: The Anscarca version of immortality differs from other civilization. The unit actually dies (allows the application of disease) but is given a new body with the same experience in the capital. This also means any acquired mutations or other promotions are removed. If the unit is killed when it's respawning, it is gone for good.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_DISEASE_ANSCARCA]Disease[\LINK] line of promotions is primarily given to Fever/Plague allowing debuffs to be applied to enemies. Swarmlings/Lurkers only have access to the first two levels
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_DIASTER_ANSCARCA]Diaster[\LINK]/[LINK=PROMOTION_CALAMITY_GRADE_ANSCARCA]Calamity[\LINK] are given to very experienced Fevers/Plagues pushing them to new tiers of power.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_FLESH_ARTILLERY_ANSCARCA]Flesh Artillery[\LINK] gives an ability to turn into a long ranged weapon capable of killing enemies. This will cause self harm which could be fatal if not used carefully!
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_PROJECTILES_ANSCARCA]Projectiles[\LINK] gives a basic ranged attack useful for weakening or harrassing enemies. 
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=SPELL_TARGET_WEAKEST]Target Weakest/Strongest[\LINK] allows a Fever/Plauge to gain/remove Marksman promotion at a [LINK=BUILDING_HUNTING_LODGE]Hunting Lodge[\LINK]
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=SPELL_TARGET_SIEGE]Targeting spec[\LINK] promos allows further customization of Fever/Plagues with the creation of a [LINK=BUILDING_DISEASE_LAB]Disease Lab[\LINK]
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_HERO]Heroes[\LINK] have no place in the Anscarca. Any instances will get replaced with [LINK=PROMOTION_HEROIC]Battle hardened[\LINK].


Trait Specific Promos:
[ICON_BULLET]Pandemic II/III: [LINK=PROMOTION_DISEASE_ANSCARCA_4]Disease IV[\LINK] and [LINK=PROMOTION_DISEASE_ANSCARCA_5]Disease V[\LINK] allows Fever/Plague/Whisper to inflict deadly debuffs.

[H2]Technology[\H2]
Units have been mostly replaced by promotions/buildings/improvements. Here are some of the highlights that might guide in which tech to head for.

[ICON_BULLET]Metal Line allows Lurkers/Monstrosity access to weapons promotions and increasing base strength from building Barracks, Training yard, and Weaponsmith.
[ICON_BULLET]Construction allows access to Flesh Artillery allowing long ranged deadly attacks at the cost of self damage of 40% (careful not to kill your unit, refunds not provided)
[ICON_BULLET]Armoured Cavalvery allows railroad to be build providing movement and increased production from improvements
[ICON_BULLET]Percision line gives a basic ranged attack
[ICON_BULLET]Blasting Powder gives increased heavy artillery damage promotions at the cost of weaker base strength
[ICON_BULLET]Animal mastery gives +1 food to farms
[ICON_BULLET]Machinery gives +1 hammer to bores
[ICON_BULLET]Magic line gives the ability to construct deadly Heralds which come with a hero's level of spell casting ability (twincast, channeling I,II,III)
[ICON_BULLET]Trade line gives a number of food enhancing buildings instead of commercial which they can't use
[ICON_BULLET]Rage - Collateral promotions
[ICON_BULLET]Water line gives ability for units to enter the seas/oceans

[ICON_BULLET]Only thing not in consideration is making this AI playable.</English>
		<French>Anscarca is an experimental civilization that changes up many mechanics which I will try to outline below.
[H2]Core Civilization Changes[\H2]
[ICON_BULLET]No commercial. All research must come from specialists. Gold is set to 10 each turn to remove any buildup. Known issue: Civic costs aren't completely negatiated so you could lose units if you choose ones with upkeep. Base mod folder has a handicap file that can possibily overcome this issue but not fully tested and only has settings for a noble equivelent.
[ICON_BULLET]Units (Lurkers/Monstrosities/Overseers) grow in strength with population. Tower of Dreams and City of a Thousand Slums are both powerful due to an extra radius. Sacrifice the Weak likewise but Anscarca gets hurt from AC so it's a risk/reward balance.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_VIRAL_LINK_ANSCARCA]Viral Link[\LINK] is how all Anscarca units are connected. This will cause unhealthy in cities so try to limit amount of city defenders. Non-native units will have it [LINK=PROMOTION_SOUL_CORRUPTION_ANSCARCA]forceably[\LINK] added.
[ICON_BULLET]Default "settings" have been heavily changed as per the Viral Link. Experience is very slow to gain, are weak against taking cities, reduced regen, and have no vision by default. However, there are special promotions on creation and then with level/age that allow the unit to choose specializations.
[ICON_BULLET]Recyclable units, all can be converted to "workers" although Swarmlings only have a chance.
[ICON_BULLET]Quick initial pop growth with grassland/plains but slow/decreases as things turn into wasteland. Needs upgraded improvements.
[ICON_BULLET]Endless Promotions. Certain promotions can be stacked although generally are very specialized where they reduce stats that they don't boost. Careful about taking these
[ICON_BULLET]Gene Optimization. As the Anscarca continues to gain experience from age, defeating enemies, recyling units, and conducting gene optimization rituals, free promotions will be given to new units once threasholds are met (100, 400, 900, etc).

[H2]Improvements[\H2]
Most consume the worker but are built instantly. Here's the major new ones.
[ICON_BULLET]Bore - Hammer focused, will remove mountains/hills
[ICON_BULLET]Farm - Food focused, can be built on water
[ICON_BULLET]Node - Built by Monstrosity/Herald, does not consume the unit. Allows Anscarca to aggressively spread borders although leaves your Monstrosity exposed for a few turns when constructing

[H2]Units[\H2]

Basic Units:
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_GROWTH_ANSCARCA]Growth[\LINK]: Worker replacement. Sacrifices to instantly build improvements
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_OVERSEER_ANSCARCA]Overseers[\LINK]: These are your fort commanders and city cores. Do NOT let a city overseer die unless you want to lose the city. Gains additional strength for city population over 10.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_WHISPER]Whisper[\LINK]: An invisible immortal scout hero. Note: Death will remove any acquired promotions from events/dungeons. 
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_LURKER]Lurkers[\LINK]: These units are spawned randomly from cities. They are invisible inside borders. Will gain additional base strength with metal weapons and every 20 population.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_SWARMLINGS]Swarmlings[\LINK]: These come in triplets although the firstborn will be stronger. They have numbers but not power. Good for scouting or infecting disease/light damage.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_FEVER]Fever[\LINK]: Mobile assassin. Strikes hard then needs a few turns to recover stealth and strike. Can gain deadly disease promotion to weaken your enemies.

Game-ending Units (Extreme build cost but powerful stats)
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_MONSTROSITY_ANSCARCA]Monstrosity[\LINK]: Elite Destroyers. Best city offense of any Anscarca unit, comes with bombard, high offense stat that increases with city population. [LINK=PROMOTION_FLESH_ARTILLERY_ANSCARCA]Flesh Artillerty[\LINK] gives a long ranged option if you prefer picking off your enemies from a distance.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_DOOM_HERALD_ANSCARCA]Doom Herald[\LINK]: Your mages of doom. Coming with twincast and channeling I,II,III (except initial unit). With the starting diaster promotion, they are able to spam out fevers to inflict disease/damage on enemies. Note: Cost increases for each one on the field.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_PLAGUE]Plague[\LINK]: Extremely mobile assassin with blitz and scaling off life mana. With enough time, these will become a complete [LINK=PROMOTION_CALAMITY_GRADE_ANSCARCA]calamity[\LINK] for your enemies.


[H2]Promotions/Spells[\H2]
Not a full list but highlighting some of the faction specific ones that should be considered

City Level
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=SPELL_OUTBREAK_ANSCARCA]Outbreak[\LINK] Worldspell that spawns Fevers/Plagues in each city. By default, this will only spawn a single fever but will spawn an extra fever for each 10 pop and plague for each 50 pop.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=SPELL_PLANETEXTRACTION_ANSCARCA]Planet Extractor[\LINK] is a city spell that allows you to exploit the planet for a large amount of production (Example: [LINK=BUILDINGCLASS_PLANETARY_EXTRACTOR_ANSCARCA_8]Extractor VIII[\LINK]) and discover ore resources ([LINK=BUILDINGCLASS_RESOURCE_CAVERN_ANSCARCA]Bronze[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDINGCLASS_LAVAFLOW_ANSCARCA]Iron[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDINGCLASS_LIFE_VEIN_ANSCARCA]Mithril[\LINK]). Just be warned that this comes at an increasing cost of AC increase, population, unrest, hell/improvement destruction, and chance of war with your neighbors.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=SPELL_CREATE_LURKER_LAIR_ANSCARCA]Create[\LINK]/[LINK=SPELL_REMOVE_LURKER_LAIR_ANSCARCA]Remove[\LINK] Lurker Lair allows you to control the spawning of Lurkers (free melee units).

Unit Promotions
[ICON_BULLET]All combat units are given three starting promotion options and then additional 6,4,2 options at age/level 50/5,150/10,400/20.
[TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_HUNTER_ANSCARCA]Hunter[\LINK] line specialize in aggression with bonuses to regen per turn outside of terrority, attack bonuses, and experience per kill.
[TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_OBSERVER_ANSCARCA]Observer[\LINK] line specialize in scouting with ability to see further, detect invisible, experience per turn, and withdrawal chance.
[TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_GUARDIAN_ANSCARCA]Guardian[\LINK] line specialize in protection of the Anscarca Terrority with wasteland bonus, defense, and healing in friendly lands.
[TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_STALKER_ANSCARCA]Stalker[\LINK] line specialize in stealth with the first promotion giving invisible to any unit (enhanced stealth to those already invisible) and then removing the revealed penalty at the second tier.
[TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_SEER_ANSCARCA]Seer[\LINK] offers the unit a random chance to gain a powerful vision buff revealing any invisible units and becoming immune to first strike/defensive strike for a turn.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_IMMORTAL_ANSCARCA]Immortal[\LINK]: The Anscarca version of immortality differs from other civilization. The unit actually dies (allows the application of disease) but is given a new body with the same experience in the capital. This also means any acquired mutations or other promotions are removed. If the unit is killed when it's respawning, it is gone for good.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_DISEASE_ANSCARCA]Disease[\LINK] line of promotions is primarily given to Fever/Plague allowing debuffs to be applied to enemies. Swarmlings/Lurkers only have access to the first two levels
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_DIASTER_ANSCARCA]Diaster[\LINK]/[LINK=PROMOTION_CALAMITY_GRADE_ANSCARCA]Calamity[\LINK] are given to very experienced Fevers/Plagues pushing them to new tiers of power.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_FLESH_ARTILLERY_ANSCARCA]Flesh Artillery[\LINK] gives an ability to turn into a long ranged weapon capable of killing enemies. This will cause self harm which could be fatal if not used carefully!
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_PROJECTILES_ANSCARCA]Projectiles[\LINK] gives a basic ranged attack useful for weakening or harrassing enemies. 
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=SPELL_TARGET_WEAKEST]Target Weakest/Strongest[\LINK] allows a Fever/Plauge to gain/remove Marksman promotion at a [LINK=BUILDING_HUNTING_LODGE]Hunting Lodge[\LINK]
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=SPELL_TARGET_SIEGE]Targeting spec[\LINK] promos allows further customization of Fever/Plagues with the creation of a [LINK=BUILDING_DISEASE_LAB]Disease Lab[\LINK]
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_HERO]Heroes[\LINK] have no place in the Anscarca. Any instances will get replaced with [LINK=PROMOTION_HEROIC]Battle hardened[\LINK].


Trait Specific Promos:
[ICON_BULLET]Pandemic II/III: [LINK=PROMOTION_DISEASE_ANSCARCA_4]Disease IV[\LINK] and [LINK=PROMOTION_DISEASE_ANSCARCA_5]Disease V[\LINK] allows Fever/Plague/Whisper to inflict deadly debuffs.

[H2]Technology[\H2]
Units have been mostly replaced by promotions/buildings/improvements. Here are some of the highlights that might guide in which tech to head for.

[ICON_BULLET]Metal Line allows Lurkers/Monstrosity access to weapons promotions and increasing base strength from building Barracks, Training yard, and Weaponsmith.
[ICON_BULLET]Construction allows access to Flesh Artillery allowing long ranged deadly attacks at the cost of self damage of 40% (careful not to kill your unit, refunds not provided)
[ICON_BULLET]Armoured Cavalvery allows railroad to be build providing movement and increased production from improvements
[ICON_BULLET]Percision line gives a basic ranged attack
[ICON_BULLET]Blasting Powder gives increased heavy artillery damage promotions at the cost of weaker base strength
[ICON_BULLET]Animal mastery gives +1 food to farms

[ICON_BULLET]Magic line gives the ability to construct deadly Heralds which come with a hero's level of spell casting ability (twincast, channeling I,II,III)
[ICON_BULLET]Trade line gives a number of food enhancing buildings instead of commercial which they can't use
[ICON_BULLET]Rage - Collateral promotions
[ICON_BULLET]Water line gives ability for units to enter the seas/oceans

[ICON_BULLET]Only thing not in consideration is making this AI playable.</German>
		<Italian>Anscarca is an experimental civilization that changes up many mechanics which I will try to outline below.
[H2]Core Civilization Changes[\H2]
[ICON_BULLET]No commercial. All research must come from specialists. Gold is set to 10 each turn to remove any buildup. Known issue: Civic costs aren't completely negatiated so you could lose units if you choose ones with upkeep. Base mod folder has a handicap file that can possibily overcome this issue but not fully tested and only has settings for a noble equivelent.
[ICON_BULLET]Units (Lurkers/Monstrosities/Overseers) grow in strength with population. Tower of Dreams and City of a Thousand Slums are both powerful due to an extra radius. Sacrifice the Weak likewise but Anscarca gets hurt from AC so it's a risk/reward balance.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_VIRAL_LINK_ANSCARCA]Viral Link[\LINK] is how all Anscarca units are connected. This will cause unhealthy in cities so try to limit amount of city defenders. Non-native units will have it [LINK=PROMOTION_SOUL_CORRUPTION_ANSCARCA]forceably[\LINK] added.
[ICON_BULLET]Default "settings" have been heavily changed as per the Viral Link. Experience is very slow to gain, are weak against taking cities, reduced regen, and have no vision by default. However, there are special promotions on creation and then with level/age that allow the unit to choose specializations.
[ICON_BULLET]Recyclable units, all can be converted to "workers" although Swarmlings only have a chance.
[ICON_BULLET]Quick initial pop growth with grassland/plains but slow/decreases as things turn into wasteland. Needs upgraded improvements.
[ICON_BULLET]Endless Promotions. Certain promotions can be stacked although generally are very specialized where they reduce stats that they don't boost. Careful about taking these
[ICON_BULLET]Gene Optimization. As the Anscarca continues to gain experience from age, defeating enemies, recyling units, and conducting gene optimization rituals, free promotions will be given to new units once threasholds are met (100, 400, 900, etc). 

[H2]Leader/Trait Overview[\H2]

[ICON_BULLET]Conquest: Traits for aggression and expansion, starts with extra lurkers
[ICON_BULLET]Adaptive: Flexibility in traits. Gets an additional lurker, fever, swarm and workers at start.
[ICON_BULLET]Infestation: Heavy early game focus but might struggle late game. Gives up research speed and military production for a large increase in free spawn rate, extra city at start, free swarms, and extra worker per new city.
[ICON_BULLET]Doomsday: Late game focused. No starting bonuses. Gets a free game ender unit(s) mid/late game and bonus to gene optimization ritual to allow for better scaling.
[ICON_BULLET]Pandemic: This trait focuses on the rogue/recon lines. Instead of free lurker spawns, you will get fevers. Also, each kill builds up a bonus against that race (or just a generic strength bonus if that unit doesn't have a race).

[H2]Religion Changes[\H2]

Adopting a religion will give a chance to add these promotions to units on build/spawn
[ICON_BULLET]Fellowship of Leaves: [LINK=PROMOTION_WOODSMAN1]Woodsman I[\LINK] and [LINK=PROMOTION_SUBDUE_ANIMAL]Subdue Animal[\LINK]

[ICON_BULLET]Council of Esus: [LINK=PROMOTION_HIDDEN_NATIONALITY]Hidden Nationality[\LINK]

[ICON_BULLET]Council of Esus: N/A (Future patch to maybe give access to council specific promos)

[H2]Promotions/Spells[\H2]
Not a full list but highlighting some of the faction specific ones that should be considered

City Level
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=SPELL_OUTBREAK_ANSCARCA]Outbreak[\LINK] Worldspell that spawns Fevers/Plagues in each city. By default, this will only spawn a single fever but will spawn an extra fever for each 10 pop and plague for each 50 pop.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=SPELL_PLANETEXTRACTION_ANSCARCA]Planet Extractor[\LINK] is a city spell that allows you to exploit the planet for a large amount of production (Example: [LINK=BUILDINGCLASS_PLANETARY_EXTRACTOR_ANSCARCA_8]Extractor VIII[\LINK]) and discover ore resources ([LINK=BUILDINGCLASS_RESOURCE_CAVERN_ANSCARCA]Bronze[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDINGCLASS_LAVAFLOW_ANSCARCA]Iron[\LINK], [LINK=BUILDINGCLASS_LIFE_VEIN_ANSCARCA]Mithril[\LINK]). Just be warned that this comes at an increasing cost of AC increase, population, unrest, hell/improvement destruction, and chance of war with your neighbors.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=SPELL_CREATE_LURKER_LAIR_ANSCARCA]Create[\LINK]/[LINK=SPELL_REMOVE_LURKER_LAIR_ANSCARCA]Remove[\LINK] Lurker Lair allows you to control the spawning of Lurkers (free melee units).

Unit Promotions
[ICON_BULLET]All combat units are given three starting promotion options and then additional 6,4,2 options at age/level 50/5,150/10,400/20.
[TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_HUNTER_ANSCARCA]Hunter[\LINK] line specialize in aggression with bonuses to regen per turn outside of terrority, attack bonuses, and experience per kill.
[TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_OBSERVER_ANSCARCA]Observer[\LINK] line specialize in scouting with ability to see further, detect invisible, experience per turn, and withdrawal chance.
[TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_GUARDIAN_ANSCARCA]Guardian[\LINK] line specialize in protection of the Anscarca Terrority with wasteland bonus, defense, and healing in friendly lands.
[TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_STALKER_ANSCARCA]Stalker[\LINK] line specialize in stealth with the first promotion giving invisible to any unit (enhanced stealth to those already invisible) and then removing the revealed penalty at the second tier.
[TAB][ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_SEER_ANSCARCA]Seer[\LINK] offers the unit a random chance to gain a powerful vision buff revealing any invisible units and becoming immune to first strike/defensive strike for a turn.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_IMMORTAL_ANSCARCA]Immortal[\LINK]: The Anscarca version of immortality differs from other civilization. The unit actually dies (allows the application of disease) but is given a new body with the same experience in the capital. This also means any acquired mutations or other promotions are removed. If the unit is killed when it's respawning, it is gone for good.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_DISEASE_ANSCARCA]Disease[\LINK] line of promotions is primarily given to Fever/Plague allowing debuffs to be applied to enemies. Swarmlings/Lurkers only have access to the first two levels
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_DIASTER_ANSCARCA]Diaster[\LINK]/[LINK=PROMOTION_CALAMITY_GRADE_ANSCARCA]Calamity[\LINK] are given to very experienced Fevers/Plagues pushing them to new tiers of power.
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_FLESH_ARTILLERY_ANSCARCA]Flesh Artillery[\LINK] gives an ability to turn into a long ranged weapon capable of killing enemies. This will cause self harm which could be fatal if not used carefully!
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_PROJECTILES_ANSCARCA]Projectiles[\LINK] gives a basic ranged attack useful for weakening or harrassing enemies. 
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=SPELL_TARGET_WEAKEST]Target Weakest/Strongest[\LINK] allows a Fever/Plauge to gain/remove Marksman promotion at a [LINK=BUILDING_HUNTING_LODGE]Hunting Lodge[\LINK]
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=SPELL_TARGET_SIEGE]Targeting spec[\LINK] promos allows further customization of Fever/Plagues with the creation of a [LINK=BUILDING_DISEASE_LAB]Disease Lab[\LINK]
[ICON_BULLET][LINK=PROMOTION_HERO]Heroes[\LINK] have no place in the Anscarca. Any instances will get replaced with [LINK=PROMOTION_HEROIC]Battle hardened[\LINK].


Trait Specific Promos:
[ICON_BULLET]Pandemic II/III: [LINK=PROMOTION_DISEASE_ANSCARCA_4]Disease IV[\LINK] and [LINK=PROMOTION_DISEASE_ANSCARCA_5]Disease V[\LINK] allows Fever/Plague/Whisper to inflict deadly debuffs.

[H2]Technology[\H2]
Units have been mostly replaced by promotions/buildings/improvements. Here are some of the highlights that might guide in which tech to head for.

[ICON_BULLET]Metal Line allows Lurkers/Monstrosity access to weapons promotions and increasing base strength from building Barracks, Training yard, and Weaponsmith.
[ICON_BULLET]Construction allows access to Flesh Artillery allowing long ranged deadly attacks at the cost of self damage of 40% (careful not to kill your unit, refunds not provided)
[ICON_BULLET]Armoured Cavalvery allows railroad to be build providing movement and increased production from improvements
[ICON_BULLET]Percision line gives a basic ranged attack
[ICON_BULLET]Blasting Powder gives increased heavy artillery damage promotions at the cost of weaker base strength
[ICON_BULLET]Animal mastery gives +1 food to farms
[ICON_BULLET]Machinery gives +1 hammer to bores
[ICON_BULLET]Magic line gives the ability to construct deadly Heralds which come with a hero's level of spell casting ability (twincast, channeling I,II,III)
[ICON_BULLET]Trade line gives a number of food enhancing buildings instead of commercial which they can't use
[ICON_BULLET]Rage - Collateral promotions
[ICON_BULLET]Water line gives ability for units to enter the seas/oceans
