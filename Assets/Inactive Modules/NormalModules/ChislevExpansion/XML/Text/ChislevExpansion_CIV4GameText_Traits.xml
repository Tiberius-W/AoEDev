		<English>When founding the Council, Natane approached The Eagle Tribe first. Natane and the Eagle Tribe leader at the time, Shimasani, believed that the tribes were becoming more and more radicalized as generations went on, as they essentially lived in an echo chamber. Shimasani, as a skilled negotiator, was able to bring the other tribal leaders into the Council one by one. Afterwards, she created programs where members of each tribe were made to intermingle with one another. Although these exchanges did not always go well, the process became easier over time.</English>

		<English>The Coyote Tribe, much to Natane's surprise, was the third tribe to join the Council. The Coyote Tribe is known as a clan of free-spirited folk, and Natane did not believe they would want to be held down by any regulations. Soyala of the Coyote Tribe saw the joining of the Council as an opportunity to make a lasting impact on the Chislev - to help them lighten up a little bit. Motsqueh was certainly a tough case to crack, but she eventually got through to him. Alosaka, when he would later join, was another story. The Coyote Tribe would often end up seeing eye-to-eye with the Serpent Tribe, who also prefered to live more on the wild side.</English>

		<English>The Bear Tribe was the second tribe to join the Council. Their desire was relatively simple: as a builder tribe, they wanted more resources; and in return, they would supply their hardy warriors for the protection of the nation. Motsqueh, the leader of the Bear Tribe at the time of the Council's founding, often ended up being the tie breaker vote once all five tribes had been brought into the fold. Typically, the Eagle Tribe and the Tortoise Tribe tended to vote together, as they both preferred peace above all else. Meanwhile, the Serpent Tribe and Coyote Tribe tended to prefer more aggressive approaches, and even though their means to that end often differed, they did at least share a common goal. Although Motsqueh did tend to vote with Shimasani and Alosaka more often, it was not uncommon for Osyka and Soyala to convince him otherwise.</English>

		<English>The Tortoise Tribe proved more difficult to recruit than Natane and Shimasani had originally thought. True, they were isolationists, but they believed the tribe would see the wisdom in joining together. Alosaka was a rather private man, and so were his people. When approached with the proposal, he requested some time to think about it. Weeks passed, and when revisited, Alosaka still had no answer. Shimasani was unsurprised, the Tortoise Tribe wasn't known for their hasty decision making, after all. Alosaka attempted to bargain that, if he were to join, he would take no part in wars. That deal wasn't feasible, as the Council would need to come together as a unit. Ultimately, they agreed that if the Tortoise Tribe be allowed to "enlighten" the rest of the tribes through books and the practice of meditation, that they would join. Alosaka hoped his presence would be able to calm the other members of the tribe down, and he was right, up until the joining of the Serpent Tribe.</English>
