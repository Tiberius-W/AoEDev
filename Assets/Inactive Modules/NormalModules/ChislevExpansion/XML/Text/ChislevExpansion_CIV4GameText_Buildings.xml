		<English>The Chislev people believe in Totemism. Totemism is not a religion in and of itself, but the totem is a symbol of either a strong tribal bonding or a representation of either a deity or some religious or historical event. That said, while totems can be religious, the totems themselves are not worshipped, but used as a symbol for their beliefs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Due to the tribal and religious importance of totems, many Chislev villages set up workshops dedicated to the making of totems. These totems are often made for their own village, but sometimes totems are exported to neighboring villages.</English>
