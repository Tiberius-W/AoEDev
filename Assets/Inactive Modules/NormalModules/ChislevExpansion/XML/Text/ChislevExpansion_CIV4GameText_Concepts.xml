		<English>[H1]Tribal Law:[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Tribal Law Elections:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]The [LINK=CIVIC_TRIBAL_LAW]Tribal Law[\LINK] civic gives control of the Chislev nation to five tribes, with a leader of one of those tribes acting as Head Chief. While the Head Chief has the final say in decisions, the other tribal chiefs advise the Head Chief. A new Head Chief will be appointed the turn you adopt Tribal Law, and every 45/60/90/180 turns thereafter, depending on your game speed. [LINK=LEADER_THE_COUNCIL]The Council[\LINK] leader does not have elections under Tribal Law. Your leader can come from the following tribes:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Eagle Tribe: [LINK=LEADER_SHIMASANI]Shimasani[\LINK] ([LINK=TRAIT_CHARISMATIC]Charismatic[\LINK]/[LINK=TRAIT_TRADER]Trader[\LINK])[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Coyote Tribe: [LINK=LEADER_SOYALA]Soyala[\LINK] ([LINK=TRAIT_CREATIVE]Creative[\LINK]/[LINK=TRAIT_IMPERIALIST]Imperalist[\LINK])[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Bear Tribe: [LINK=LEADER_MOTSQUEH]Motsqueh[\LINK] ([LINK=TRAIT_EXPANSIVE]Expansive[\LINK]/[LINK=TRAIT_INDUSTRIOUS]Industrious[\LINK])[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Serpent Tribe: [LINK=LEADER_OSYKA]Osyka[\LINK] ([LINK=TRAIT_AGGRESSIVE]Aggressive[\LINK]/[LINK=TRAIT_RAIDERS]Raiders[\LINK])[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Tortoise Tribe: [LINK=LEADER_ALOSAKA]Alosaka[\LINK] ([LINK=TRAIT_PHILOSOPHICAL]Philosophical[\LINK]/[LINK=TRAIT_DEFENDER]Defender[\LINK])[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During elections, you may vote for a different leader, the same leader, allow the game to randomize it for you, or decide not to hold an election. If you vote for the same leader, you will have a turn of anarchy unless that leader is Shimasani; however, there will also be a 50% chance of a positive effect. For Shimasani, it's +3 relations with all other leaders. For Soyala, Motsqueh, and Osyka, they get a Great Bard, Great Engineer, or Great Commander respectively. For Alosaka, he will enter a golden age. Picking a different leader simply switches to that leader, and your alignment resets to that leader's alignment. Allowing the game to randomize for you picks one of the five options at random, and gives you one turn of "We Love the Head Chief Day". If it happens to pick the leader you currently are, you will not suffer a turn of anarchy. The last option, to not hold an election, is only useful if you want to remain as [LINK=LEADER_CHISLEV]Absaroke[\LINK] or [LINK=LEADER_NATANE]Natane[\LINK] while operating under Tribal Law.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Tribal Units:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]While under Tribal Law, all units that you acquire will come from one of the five tribes at random, with the exception of [LINK=UNIT_MESKWAKI]Meskwaki[\LINK], who will always be from the Bear Tribe. If you train a unit in a source totem city (explained below), the unit is guaranteed to be from that tribe, whether you're using Tribal Law or not. The units will start with a promotion depending on their tribe, and if they would have already received that promotion from another source, it gets incremented to its next level:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Eagle Tribe: [LINK=PROMOTION_MOBILITY1]Mobility[\LINK][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Coyote Tribe:[LINK=PROMOTION_DRILL1]Drill[\LINK][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Bear Tribe: [LINK=PROMOTION_COMBAT1]Combat[\LINK][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Serpent Tribe: [LINK=PROMOTION_CITY_RAIDER1]City Raider[\LINK][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Tortoise Tribe: [LINK=PROMOTION_CITY_GARRISON1]City Garrison[\LINK][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Menawa Unit:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Tribal Law also unlocks the ability to create the [LINK=UNIT_MENAWA]Menawa[\LINK] unit. While not entirely powerful on its own, it can be unlocked fairly early at [LINK=TECH_MILITARY_STRATEGY]Military Strategy[\LINK], and comes with one of five unique abilities depending on what tribe you wish the unit to come from:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Eagle Tribe: Ignores terrain costs, +1 Movement Range[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Coyote Tribe: 10% chance to avoid bad lair results, 10% withdrawal chance, 100% extra gold from pillaging, and a 10% chance to do 5% damage when this unit's stack is attacked[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Bear Tribe: +1 offensive and defensive strength[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Serpent Tribe: 15% chance to generate a slave after combat, attacks the weakest unit in the stack[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Tortoise Tribe: +10% defensive strength, double fortification bonus, and guards against enemy Marksman units[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]If you move away from the Tribal Law civic, your Menawa units will abandon you.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Totem System:[\H1][NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:1]The totem system represents a small collection of tribes that operate under the larger entity that is the Chislev nation. When you construct a totem building, referred to as a source totem, it will automatically create replica totems of the same kind in all cities up to 4 tiles away (diagonally and/or orthogonally). Any other cities founded or acquired in that range will also receive a replica totem. There is a one turn delay in this propagation. Replica totems do not propagate other totems. If a source totem is lost, then all replica totems will also be lost. Source totems are national wonders, but, like your capital, it may be moved, bearing in mind that any replica totems that would leave the range of the source totem will lose their totem. Totems come in two flavors: tribal and religious. In both cases, if you have a source totem or a replica totem in a city, you cannot build a new source totem of that same type. So a city with a Totem of the Eagle (source or replica) could not build a Totem of the Bear, but could build a Totem of the Earth. Source totem cities represent the heartland of a tribe or religion. Replica totem cities represent a trickling down of members of that tribe or religion, and as a result, a city can have as many as three replica totems, depending on the city's positioning. Both tribal and religious totems require three [LINK=BUILDING_TOTEM_WORKSHOP]Totem Workshops[\LINK] in your empire before you can build them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These are the different tribal totems and their benefits:[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_TOTEM_OF_THE_EAGLE]Totem of the Eagle[\LINK]: +2 happiness, free [LINK=PROMOTION_SENTRY1]Sentry[\LINK] promotion[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_TOTEM_OF_THE_COYOTE]Totem of the Coyote[\LINK]: +2 food and culture[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_TOTEM_OF_THE_BEAR]Totem of the Bear[\LINK]: +2 health, free [LINK=PROMOTION_STRONG]Strong[\LINK] promotion[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_TOTEM_OF_THE_SERPENT]Totem of the Serpent[\LINK]: +2 unit XP, -50% war weariness, free [LINK=PROMOTION_ORC_SLAYING]Orc Slaying[\LINK] promotion[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_TOTEM_OF_THE_TORTOISE]Totem of the Tortoise[\LINK]: 10% city defense, enemies suffer +5% war weariness, +2 Great People Points, and free [LINK=PROMOTION_MAGIC_RESISTANCE]Magic Resistance[\LINK] promotion[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These are the different religious totems and their benefits:[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_TOTEM_OF_THE_JUNGLE]Totem of the Jungle[\LINK]: [LINK=PROMOTION_SPIRIT_OF_THE_JUNGLE]Spirit of the Jungle[\LINK] promotion for arcane units built in this city[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_TOTEM_OF_THE_EARTH]Totem of the Earth[\LINK]: [LINK=PROMOTION_SPIRIT_OF_THE_EARTH]Spirit of the Earth[\LINK] promotion for arcane units built in this city[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_TOTEM_OF_THE_SEA]Totem of the Sea[\LINK]: [LINK=PROMOTION_SPIRIT_OF_THE_SEA]Spirit of the Sea[\LINK] promotion for arcane units built in this city[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_TOTEM_OF_THE_FLAMES]Totem of the Flames[\LINK]: [LINK=PROMOTION_SPIRIT_OF_THE_FLAMES]Spirit of the Flames[\LINK] promotion for arcane units built in this city[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_TOTEM_OF_THE_FROST]Totem of the Frost[\LINK]: [LINK=PROMOTION_SPIRIT_OF_THE_FROST]Spirit of the Frost[\LINK] promotion for arcane units built in this city[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_TOTEM_OF_WAR]Totem of War[\LINK]: [LINK=PROMOTION_SPIRIT_OF_WAR]Spirit of War[\LINK] promotion for arcane units built in this city[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_TOTEM_OF_ENLIGHTENMENT]Totem of Enlightenment[\LINK]: [LINK=PROMOTION_SPIRIT_OF_ENLIGHTENMENT]Spirit of Enlightenment[\LINK] promotion for arcane units built in this city[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Other Additions:[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Funeral Pyres:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Burning the dead is an important part of Chislev culture. This has been implemented in-game through the ability to create a funeral pyre for units who have achieved level 5 or higher when they die. In order to do this, when the unit of level 5 or higher dies, there must be a [LINK=UNIT_TOTEMIST]Totemist[\LINK] or [LINK=UNIT_SPIRIT_HEALER]Spirit Healer[\LINK] in the same stack. That unit will automatically be given the [LINK=PROMOTION_BONES_OF_THE_EXALTED]Bones of the Exalted[\LINK] item, which allows them to cast the [LINK=SPELL_BUILD_FUNERAL_PYRE]Build Funeral Pyre[\LINK] spell. Although it consumes the movement of the unit, it will provide all units in the stack with the [LINK=PROMOTION_MORALE]Morale[\LINK] promotion.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Idols:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]Idols act as tribe-specific [LINK=PROMOTION_SPIRIT_GUIDE]Spirit Guides[\LINK]. To acquire an idol, a a Totemist, Mage, Archmage, or Spirit Healer of a tribe must be at either a source totem or replica totem city of their tribe. There, they may buy an idol of their tribe for 25 gold. If killed while holding an idol, they will pass a portion of their experience to a random unit that is from their tribe.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]Chislev Spirit Affinity:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1]All Chislev Disciple Units, as well as the Spirit Healer, Totemist arcane line, Warchief, and Meskwaki, will get the Chislev Spirit affinity. This affinity provides these units with +5% heal rate, +0.5 XP from combat, and +0.5 strength per spirit mana.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]The Council:[\BOLD][PARAGRAPH:1][LINK=LEADER_THE_COUNCIL]The Council[\LINK] is a new emergent leader, but doesn't level up a single trait, as other emergent leaders do. Instead, the Council is constantly vying for the favor of the five tribes. Most of your in-game actions will effect your relations with one of the tribes, and if a particular tribe likes you enough, they'll join the council (represented by earning a unique trait). Favor with all tribes will decrease over time, but whenever a tribe joins, you get a small buffer window so that they won't leave you right after joining you. Earning favor with the tribes is described in more detail under the [LINK=CONCEPT_THE_COUNCIL_DYNAMIC_LEADER]Chislev - The Council (Dynamic Leader)[\LINK] Concept Pedia entry.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]New Units:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_TOMAHAWK_THROWER]Tomahawk Thrower[\LINK]: Replaces the Axeman. This unit is a combination between an axeman and an archer, gaining a ranged attack, a first strike, and a chance of a defensive strike.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=UNIT_MOUNTED_PLAINS_HUNTER]Mounted Plains Hunter[\LINK]: Replaces the Horse Archer. Has one less base strength, but gains +50% strength in plains and grasslands. It is +50% stronger against beasts and animals. It also has a slightly higher ranged attack.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][BOLD]New Buildings:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_CANOE_HARBOR]Canoe Harbor[\LINK]: This harbor only gives 25% trade route yield instead of 50%, but is cheaper to build and provides +2 food.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_WARCHIEF_HARBOR]Warchief's Harbor[\LINK]: Requires 3 Canoe Harbors. The Warchief's Harbor provides +10% production to sea units, +2 XP to sea units, 1 trade route, and +50% trade route yield.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_TRIBAL_WATCHPOST]Tribal Watchpost[\LINK]: The Tribal Watchpost replaces the Lighthouse, but does not need to be on the coast. It gives +1 food on plains tiles, +1 trade route, and 5% city defense.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET][LINK=BUILDING_WARCHIEF_SECURITY_COUNCIL]Warchief's Security Council[\LINK]: Requires 3 Tribal Watchposts. Provides +10% city defense, +10% land unit production, +2 recon unit XP, and a 0.25 train rate for recon units.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][H1]Changes:[\H1][NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The [LINK=BUILDING_ARTISANS_WORKSHOP]Artisan's Workshop[\LINK] is no longer a blocked building, but is replaced by the [LINK=BUILDING_TOTEM_WORKSHOP]Totem Workshop[\LINK].[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The Chislev use the [LINK=UNIT_TOTEMIST]Totemist[\LINK] instead of the [LINK=UNIT_ADEPT]Adept[\LINK]. They cannot build the [LINK=BUILDING_MAGE_GUILD]Mage Guild[\LINK], but require the Totem Workshop, instead.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]Blocked out the Bear Totem and Totem of Old Enemy, as those were merged into the tribal totems.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The cost of the [LINK=UNIT_ROCK_RAVEN]Rock Raven[\LINK] has been reduced by 5, although it still costs 5 more than the [LINK=UNIT_HAWK]Hawk[\LINK], which it replaces.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The [LINK=BUILDING_SHIPYARD]Shipyard[\LINK] is now a blocked building for the Chislev.[NEWLINE][ICON_BULLET]The Chislev uses Native American selection sounds rather than Aztec selection sounds.</English>
