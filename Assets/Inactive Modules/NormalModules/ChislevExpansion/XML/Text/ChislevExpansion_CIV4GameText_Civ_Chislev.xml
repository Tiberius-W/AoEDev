		<English>The Chislev honor their warriors who have proven themselves. To these select few, they are given the title Menawa, or Great Warrior. To each of the tribes, earning this title is acquired in a different way. To the Eagle Tribe, they must prove their leadership in battle. The Coyote Tribe must prove their cunning, outwitting their foes to win a battle against the odds. The Bear Tribe reveres tremendous strength, giving the title to those who best their opponents through sheer force. The Serpent Tribe prefers a stealthy and aggressive style, rewarding the title to those who are skilled at catching their enemy off-guard. Finally, the Tortoise Tribe rewards warriors who go out of their way to defend their allies or those in need.</English>

With our assistance, of course."[PARAGRAPH:1]"But we would be spreading ourselves too far out. We must keep the front supplied, and moving it out could both delay that and make it more likely that the orcs can flank us and cut off our supply route."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, I could see how that would be a problem..." She paused, as if deep in thought, "How about if the Chislev joined alongside the Bannor in battle? The orcs would no longer be able to flank you through the plains around the jungle."[PARAGRAPH:1]The emissary's eyes beamed. "You'll join in the war?" Of course, the Chislev had been planning on it regardless, but why not use that as a bargaining chip?[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, if that will help you move your supply line ahead to protect our people."[PARAGRAPH:1]"I think that Sabathiel will find that most agreeable. But I will need to present this news to the High Priests to consult with Sabathiel before I can give you the word of the Bannor."[PARAGRAPH:1]She nodded, "Of course. Sabathiel's wisdom is almighty. He will know what is best."[PARAGRAPH:1]The emissary looked somewhat surprised. "You believe Sabathiel to be real? Many outsiders dismiss him as myth."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, of course," Shimasani replied with a smile, "The Chislev of all people understand spiritual manifestations. The tales of Sabathiel leading the Bannor through Hell resonates with our people, who have gone through something of a Hell recently with the orcs... not to compare that with what Sabathiel and the Bannor went through, of course. We all know of Him, and believe in Him."[PARAGRAPH:1]The emissary sat up gleefully. "I'll deliver your message at once. You will hear news from our messengers within a week."[PARAGRAPH:1]Within a fortnight, the Bannor began to move their front lines closer into the heart of the jungle, blocking a route for the orcs to make their way into Chislev lands. Absaroke prepared for war, and the Serpent Tribe was ever ready to strike out on his behalf. Shimasani would continue act as an emissary for the Chislev people, negotiating them through any difficulties that came their way. It was through her diplomacy that the Chislev came to be respected as a nation of their word.</English>

Many outsiders dismiss him as myth."[PARAGRAPH:1]"Yes, of course," Shimasani replied with a smile, "The Chislev of all people understand spiritual manifestations. The tales of Sabathiel leading the Bannor through Hell resonates with our people, who have gone through something of a Hell recently with the orcs... not to compare that with what Sabathiel and the Bannor went through, of course. We all know of Him, and believe in Him."[PARAGRAPH:1]The emissary sat up gleefully. "I'll deliver your message at once. You will hear news from our messengers within a week."[PARAGRAPH:1]Within a fortnight, the Bannor began to move their front lines closer into the heart of the jungle, blocking a route for the orcs to make their way into Chislev lands. Absaroke prepared for war, and the Serpent Tribe was ever ready to strike out on his behalf. Shimasani would continue act as an emissary for the Chislev people, negotiating them through any difficulties that came their way. It was through her diplomacy that the Chislev came to be respected as a nation of their word.</Spanish>

		<English>[TAB]"Halt! State your business," a Bannor camp guard held out his hand to Soyala.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I've come to see off your Captain Galfridus. Your men in the region have really made things so much safer around here, and I wanted to... properly thank him."[PARAGRAPH:1]The guard paused for a moment, "Uh... yes, I think he'd be amenable to that... but I'll need to pat you down."[PARAGRAPH:1]Soyala nodded as the guard gave her a quick patting, awkwardly avoiding certain areas. He then called out, "Soyala, warchief of the Coyote Tribe, has arrived to see Captain Galfridus!" The echo carried through the camp, and within about a minute, Captain Galfridus had arrived. He was an older, ugly sort of man, yet his skill in battle made him feel as though he deserved whatever he saw fit. [PARAGRAPH:1]"Well what have we here," he said, eyeing Soyala up and down, "The warchief of the Coyote Tribe herself! What brings you here?!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Soyala faked a bashful look away, before looking back into the captain's eyes, "With your battle tomorrow, and considering what all you've done in protecting the Chislev, I thought I'd thank you with a little... morale boost."[PARAGRAPH:1]The captain licked his lips, "Yes... I'd rather enjoy that. Let me show you to my tent."[PARAGRAPH:1]Soyala caught a glimpse of the camp as she walked. There were probably a good 300 men here, quite enough to deal with the orcs in their battle tomorrow, based on Soyala's intel. Still, it would be a close battle.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Here we are," the captain motioned forward, "Would you like a drink?"[PARAGRAPH:1] "Wine would be lovely," she said as she faked a smile.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Wouldn't have taken you for a wine lady!" [PARAGRAPH:1]Captain Galfridus poured themselves each a glass, and by the time Soyala has only gotten a few sips in, the captain had chugged down the entire glass. Soyala turned her body away bashfully and snickered, while making a deft movement with her left hand.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I really am such a lightweight!" she said, giggling, as she swirled the remaining wine in the glass. "Since you handle your drinks so well, could you perhaps finish mine off before we get down to business?"[PARAGRAPH:1]Without a word, the captain took the glass, chugged it down, and approached Soyala lustfully.[PARAGRAPH:1]Late the next day, Soyala had arrived safely back in her village; and the next morning, she began describing the Bannor camp to her personal assistant, Una. They were interrupted by a Chislev scout, "Soyala! The Bannor have just barely defeated the orcs in battle, but Captain Galfridus fell in combat!"[PARAGRAPH:1]Soyala nodded, thanking the scout for his report, then shooed him off. She turned to Una with a smile, "A slow acting poison... the Bannor won't suspect a thing."[PARAGRAPH:1]"But won't he just be easily replaced?"[PARAGRAPH:1]"Of course, as the Bannor do; but we must hope that the next captain does not treat our women as his and his men's personal playthings. And if he does, he shall be dealt with promptly. And the next. And the next. And the next..."</English>

		<English>[TAB]"Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!" The crowd cheered the two men on as they stood upon the fighting mound. On one side was Otskai, the village butcher, and an absolute mountain of a man. He roared with delight in response to the crowd's cheers, his jugular protruding from his neck as his scream filled in the air. On the other side of the mound was Motsqueh, a significantly smaller man; but that's comparing a bear to a mountain. Motsqueh stared intensely back at the man. He hadn't done what Otskai had accused him of, but this was how the Bear Tribe settled their differences: with hand-to-hand combat. Death isn't ruled out of one of the combatants deems it necessary.[PARAGRAPH:1]The mountain of a man charged at Motsqueh, the earth tremoring with each step as though a desert wurm were beneath their very feet. Motsqueh rolled off to the side to avoid the clothesline, then quickly stood himself back up and leaped towards the charging Otskai, who was now running past him. As Motsqueh came back down, he jabbed his rival in the neck, and brought his leg down against his knee, causing the large man to lose his balance and tumble head first into a bear totem.[PARAGRAPH:1]The crowd began to laugh until the bear totem started rocking back and forth, beginning to fall into the crowd of spectators. Motsqueh dashed to the other end of the totem, doing his best to hold it up. This was not a task for a single man, not even for someone as strong as Motsqueh, but he had hoped to bide some time so the crowd could disperse. Yet there were a couple who still stood in the totem's path, locked in fear, as their life began to flash their through eyes. He could hold it no longer; but as the weight began to work its way into him, suddenly the totem became lighter, and made its way back up to its base.[PARAGRAPH:1]"You're a good fighter, Motsqueh, but leave the totem lifting to me," Otskai let out a bellowing laugh, despite the blood running down the side of his face, "You could have ended me there. I wanted a fight to the death, and you knew that. I respect that you risked yourself to save those people... maybe I can trust you after all."[PARAGRAPH:1]"I am a man of my word, Otskai, and a man that respects the vows and promises that others have made to each other. Take the rest of the day off. Go home and be with Wallowa. You've earned that much."[PARAGRAPH:1]Motsqueh tended to those in the crowd who had very nearly been crushed by a totem, before turning back to look at its etchings. There was still room for a few more stories on there. This one, with Otskai's permission, would be a perfect fit.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Orcs were flooding through the village, pillaging everything in their wake. Nobody was safe: the men, the women, or the children; but especially not the women. The village was on fire, and the men, as much as they tried, could not hold back the onslaught. They were being killed off by the dozens. Everyone was. Coahoma took her young daughter and hid underneath a wheelbarrow, covering her up with a cloak. She put her finger to the young girl's crying mouth.[PARAGRAPH:1]"Quiet, little one... we must not let them know we are here." Coahoma tried to be brave, but it was impossible to hide the fear in her voice.[PARAGRAPH:1]A pair of orc feet stopped just before the cart, then stooped down. The orc smiled a wide, toothy smile before grabbing Coahoma and dragging her out from underneath the cart. The young girl wanted to scream, but she was so frozen in fear, she couldn't move. All she could do was look on in horror through the threading of the cloak as the orcs committed unspeakable acts against her mother. Suddenly she noticed a gentle breeze against her ankle. The cloak had been brushed aside when the orc had grabbed her mother... and a band of orcs were marching by the cart. They stopped just in front of the cart. Something was said in orcish, and suddenly, the horde dispersed, taking jewelry, weapons, and women with them. But not Coahoma. They had slit her throat after they were done with her. The young girl waited awhile, and when the coast was clear, she ran out to her mother, holding her head in her lap.[PARAGRAPH:1]"I'll get revenge... I'll kill them all... every last one of them. I'LL KILL THEM ALL!" She screamed at the top of her lungs. She couldn't care less if there were still orcs about. All that fueled her now was rage and vengeance.[PARAGRAPH:1]Osyka opened her eyes. It was the same vision she had had many times before... a flashback to her past. But she relished in these daydreams. Each time, it reminded her of why she's pressing on. Why she's on this quest for revenge. She sat on horseback with her warriors in front of the orc village. With a yell, she and her riders charged at the unsuspecting orcs. She'd kill them all.</English>

		<English>[TAB]Alosaka is a man shrouded in mystery. He appeared to Absaroke many years ago, lost and confused. The man was clearly Chislev, but he could not remember in what village he was born, or even what tribe he had come from. However, he possessed a powerful sense of magic, and quickly became one of Absaroke's shamans in his personal council. Over that period of time, Alosaka began to have visions of his past in brief glimpses. He now knows that, at one point, he went and fought with the Amurites against the D'Tesh, a war that did not end favorably for the Amurites. It was in this war that he suffered a serious head injury, leading to a loss of much of his memory.[PARAGRAPH:1]Shortly after the orcs had attacked some of the Chislev jungle villages, Alosaka was assigned as a chief strategist in the coming war. Alosaka proved himself to be a capable tactician, seemingly able to predict his enemy's moves. It was a skill that saved many lives, and as a result, Absaroke promised to Alosaka whatever he desired. Alosaka requested to found his own tribe. There were a number of Chislev who were exhausted from the war, who wanted nothing more than to retreat away and do their own thing. It was these members of the Chislev who would become the Tortoise Tribe, led by Alosaka.[PARAGRAPH:1]Alosaka made the primary focus of the Tortoise Tribe to reach enlightenment through study. They wished nothing more than to be left in solitude. Alosaka did his best to stay out of the wars and battles that the other tribes ensued in, although he would still honor any call to arms issued to him by Absaroke. Alosaka slowly became more and more reserved with time, and after two failed assassination attempts, he also became rather paranoid. While Alosaka had visions of living with the Amurites, he did not know why he left in the first place. It was a thought that plagued him: why had he left the Chislev? Was it as simple as wanting to further his skill with magic? Or was there a deeper reason, like something he shouldn't have known and tried to get away from? It would certainly explain the assassins. Alosaka began to obsessively devote every waking minute to figure out what had happened in his past, and to improve his magical prowess in an attempt to recollect those memories through clairvoyance. His people know that he is extremely reserved, but Alosaka does not bring up his troubled memories, and that is something that will likely never change.</English>

		<Spanish>[TAB]It had been years since the start of the war with the Clan of Embers. The younger Chislev didn't even know how it all began, and many called for peace; but the Council were wise, and were privy to all of the Chislev tales, back to their origin. They knew that there would be no peace so long as they bordered The Clan. Bhall and The Clan would not rest. The Council was thankful to have the Bannor as allies. Some of the Bannor may have viewed the Chislev as savages, but regardless, as long time war partners, they had a mutual respect for one another.[PARAGRAPH:1]The Council was made of five leaders: one from each of the great tribes of the past. The tribes had come together against the orcs and had become such a cohesive unit, that it became difficult to distinguish one tribe from the next, unlike how things had been a generation or two ago. Still, one tribe stood out from the rest: the fiery spirit of the Serpent Tribe. The Serpent Tribe had still not forgotten the wrongs committed against them by the orcs, and they made damn well sure that their younger generations knew of their struggle. The Serpent Tribe were certainly the most vocal of the lot, and any time a chance for peace fell on the table, the Serpent Tribe reminded the rest of the Council of the Chislev's past, and that their could be no peace until this ember was extinguished.
