		<English>When a unit of level five or higher dies in a stack with either a [LINK=UNIT_SPIRIT_HEALER]Spirit Healer[\LINK] or a [LINK=UNIT_TOTEMIST]TOTEMIST[\LINK], the Spirit Healer or Totemist receives an item called [LINK=PROMOTION_BONES_OF_THE_EXALTED]Bones of the Exalted[\LINK]. The bones may then be buried to give all applicable units in the stack the [LINK=PROMOTION_MORALE]Morale[\LINK] promotion, although this will consume the movement of the unit. Additionally, the bones may be picked up by another Spirit Healer or Totemist in case you want to free up the unit currently carrying the bones to cast a different spell.</English>
