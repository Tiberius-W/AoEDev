		<English>Ratha can only be built with Empyrean as your state religion and present in a city, but do not require the siege workshop like a regular chariot. They can cast the Blinding Light spell to hold enemies in place, and are secondary class Disciples - they can use any bonuses to disciple units, such as the Spiritual trait. They also have 3 perception which allows them to spot any of your rival's assassins, and they are more effective against rogue class units, making them a helpful counter against those fond of assassins and thieves. Be aware, they do not have enough perception to spot a hostile Shadow without further promotions like Sentry. </English>
