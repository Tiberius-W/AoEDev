Boar: -1 move, trades 40% archer bonus for 40% melee bonus (khazad boar riders changed to match). Warriors beware!
Rat: -1 move, +25% city attack 
Lion: As lion blood, Courage
Tiger: Stealth 1 and +1 first strike. Nyxkin start with this.
Stag: As stag blood, 20% magic resist and forest movement. Fyrdwell start with this.
Bear: Generic name Great Beast (to be used for doviello and khazad UUs), +2 attack strength, -1 move. UUs total stats won't change, they'll get a defense boost to end up where they were before
Wolf: +2 perception, go sniff out some rogue units
Dinosaur: Trades 40% archer bonus for 40% recon bonus.
Spider: -1 move and strength, but +2 poison strength.
Flying: Requires Warhorses, but grants flying. No movement bonus like pegasus mount has and locked until late game, so austrin are flying mount experts.
Gorillas do not make for good riding animals
Not planning on anything for sand worms. Because any mounted unit that rides on a sandworm probably deserves radical function changes.
Toads when they get added - amphibious, of course. Don't ask me what a toad chariot looks like.
