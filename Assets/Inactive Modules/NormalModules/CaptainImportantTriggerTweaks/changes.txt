Overall this will make it easier to earn traits, and several traits that I felt were too hard to earn are now much easier or have more clear routes to earn them. Focused more on the hard to earn traits than traits that are already easy to earn. Some weaker traits got small boosts in effectiveness.

This is aimed more at epic and standard speed, not at quick or marathon speed. Hard to find a perfect balance for all of them so I went with what I'm familiar with. It'll still function, it might be a little hard to earn some traits on marathon or they'll be too fast on quick.

[ WARLORD ]
- 50 points per training building built.
CHANGE TO BASE TRAIT - Ambition promo is now available for all non-animal unit types (now allowed recon, mounted, siege, naval). Ambition is also allowed on undead units, so that naval, siege, and scions of patria can use it. So charismatic is -25% exp required for all and +1 happy, ambitious is +25% exp gain for all except beasts, and double build speed for training buildings. Pretty close in function anyway. Funny if you stack both, but that's part of the fun of important traits anyway.

[ ARCANE ]
- 100 points per mana node built
To try give you a more thematic way to earn the trait than spamming haste on nothing or join/leave commander.
- 50 points per mage guild build
Summoner now has other ways to earn points. You'll likely make progress towards both if you are using arcane units anway.

[ CREATIVE ]
- 50 points per carnival built.

[ DEFENDER ]
- 50 points per wall built.
- 20 points per pallisade built.
- 10 points per archery unit built.

[ EXPANSIVE ]
- 20 points for each granary, and smokehouse
- 50 points per aqueduct

[ FINANCIAL ]
- 50 points per gambling house.
- 5 points per cottage built.

[ FISHERMAN ]
CHANGE TO BASE TRAIT - now gives flanking 1 free promo for naval units. Just a small thematic bonus.

[ INGENUITY ]
- 10 points per built lumbermill, windmill, and watermill.
CHANGE TO BASE TRAIT - upgrade discount increased to 80% reduction. now gives +1 commerce to all 3 mills, for a thematically more 'high-tech' and industrialized society.

[ ORGANIZED ]
- Increased point gain from courthouse to 75 (from 50)
- Earn 50 points per great commander earned
Since it gives access to command posts and commander stacks are nice and organized. Just a small boost to a not-that-interesting trait.

[ SPIRITUAL ]
- 50 points per religious temple you build.
Odd that this trait only gave points for pagan temples. Now it should be easier to found your religion, build some new temples, get some disciple units, and get this trait, if you wanted it.

[ SUMMONER ]
- 100 points the first time you cast each regular arcane summon spell or religious summon spell (no unique unit or civ-specific summons)
- Mage guild bonus moved to arcane
- Still gives points per arcane unit built
Obviously some overlap between this and arcane, but should be more reasonable to earn this without building 70+ adepts. Note that summon bonus points are FIRST TIME ONLY. If you reject this trait the first time it is offered, it will be much harder to earn again!

[ SWASHBUCKLER ]
- 10 points per melee unit trained
- 30 points per naval unit trained
- 50 points per amphibious promotion
CHANGE TO BASE TRAIT - now gives expanded cargo and navigation 1 (+1 movement) to naval units. I don't think this seriously competes with aggressive but it should at least be more fun to load up some big cargo boats for an amphibious assault.

[ TRADER ]
Sorry but this trait is so broken late game and so easy to earn that in this one case, there's a nerf. You now earn trader from connecting luxuries (including duplicates) to your trade network, rather than making deals with AI (such as opening and cancelling borders again, or giving gifts of 1 gold...)
- 40 points per luxury connected to your trade network.
