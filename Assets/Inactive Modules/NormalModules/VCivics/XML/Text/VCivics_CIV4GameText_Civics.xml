		<English>A magocracy fundamentally resembles a classical aristocracy, wherein leadership is bestowed upon the most proficient individuals; however, in this instance, proficiency is defined by one's mastery of magic. Unlike many traditional aristocracies, this principle holds true more often than not, owing to the inherent difficulty of the arcane sciences. In morally questionable nations, a weak mage will likely find themselves at the hot end of a fireball if unable to adequately defend their position.[PARAGRAPH:2]Within a magocracy, aspiring individuals must possess some degree of magical aptitude to attain prominence, with those possessing exceptional magical prowess assuming leadership roles in government, academia, and military affairs. Nevertheless, this system harbors a significant flaw, as numerous brilliant scientists and artisans have found themselves relegated to mundane roles due to their lack of magical talent.[PARAGRAPH:2]"Amidst the swirling mists of the arcane, my tale found its bitter conclusion. In the heart of power's grasp, my brilliance wilted beneath the gaze of those who wielded magic as their scepter. Let my fate serve as a warning: in realms where the ethereal holds sway, even the most steadfast souls risk becoming mere shadows, lost in the labyrinth of enchantment's allure."[PARAGRAPH]- Magnus the Unseen</English>
