A lot of thanks go to saibotlieh for the nice model of the skuld demon he converted from Atlantica Online, thx to the developers of this game as well (I take no credit for the artwork and all rights are within NDOORS Corporation of course), and really much thanx go to shoggi, anw, black imperator, Opera, Jheral, Valkrionn, Snarko ... especially Morte and lots of more of the RIFE team and whoever were patient with me asking stupid questions in the chat or on the forums ... this is my first module. Help me improve it by writing my on http://greyfox.me/rife/forum/ if you encounter bugs or stupid nonsense within this piece of work. Thank you for trying out.
