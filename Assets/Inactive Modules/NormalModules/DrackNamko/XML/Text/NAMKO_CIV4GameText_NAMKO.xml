        <English>
A shadowed land where the past walks eternal, where faith outlives flesh, and where death is but the first step toward true devotion.
[H2]Origins and the Curse of Nephtharia[\H2]
The Namko people were once a proud province of Patria, a thriving domain of scholars, warriors, and priests devoted to the gods. But when the empire fell, so too did their civilization, burned, shattered, and lost to history. Nephtharia, the high priestess of Namko, refused to surrender to ruin. Betrayed and left to die, she called out in her final breath, not for salvation, but for the power to fulfill her sacred duty. And the gods answered.
Bound against her will to an undying form, Nephtharia wandered the frozen wastelands of the Age of Ice, learning the secrets of the deathless. With time, she discovered a way to return her people, not as mere corpses, but as eternal servants of the divine. Though they had died in agony and war, she offered them a second life, one free from hunger, weakness, and the failures of mortality.
[H2]Faith Beyond Flesh[\H2]
To the rulers of Namko, the mortal form is flawed. It succumbs to exhaustion, to temptation, to suffering. An undead priest never wavers in prayer, an undead warrior never tires in battle, an undead king never withers upon the throne. In undeath, devotion becomes absolute.
Nephtharia and her Deathless Court have since rebuilt their empire in the cold lands abandoned by the living. Cloaked in eerie purple flame, their cities hum with whispered prayers, and their black obelisks stretch toward the sky, marking where the dead rise in service of the gods. Pilgrims, both living and undead, flock to Namko, seeking the path of eternity. Some come willing, others do not, but all who enter the empire will serve the gods… forever.   
[H2]The Nameless Procession[\H2]
At the heart of Namkos capital, a never-ending march echoes through the streets. The Nameless Procession is a ceaseless train of the newly risen, their past selves stripped away, their bodies remade in the image of divine service. To join the Procession is the highest honor. All sins, all failures of mortal life are erased, leaving only a perfect, undying worshiper in its place.
Among the living nations, the Great Deathless Empire is feared and misunderstood. To them, Nephtharia is a tyrant, a witch, an abomination who enslaves the dead. But to those within Namkos borders, she is the true guide of the faithful, a prophetess of the gods who has granted them the only gift that matters, existence beyond death, a place in the eternal order.
And when the living world has burned itself to dust and ruin, the deathless will remain. Praying. Marching. Waiting.
