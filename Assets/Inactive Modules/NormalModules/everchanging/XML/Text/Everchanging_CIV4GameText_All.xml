        <English>"This... I... where am I? What happened?"[NEWLINE]She tried to look around, still feeling slightly dizzy from whatever occurred,  finding herself sitting against a wall and being chained to the same one. The room appeared to be a rather small prison cell. An armored figure stood before her, looking down at her.[NEWLINE]"You were dead and then decided to start living again. At least I made it pretty sure you were dead. Though that didn't seem to stop you for long."[NEWLINE]"I died... again." She spoke the last word in a barely audible whisper.[NEWLINE]"Were you the one who killed me?"[NEWLINE]"Yes."[NEWLINE]She tried to move, noticing the armored figure moving his hand to his weapon, in case she tried to attack. But all she did, was get into a kneeling position, bowing  to the person as best as she could, considering her chained situation.[NEWLINE]"If you were truly the one who has slain me, then I pledge my allegiance to you and your cause. Even if you won't have me, I will follow you and protect you with my life."[NEWLINE]"Why?"[NEWLINE]"I... made a deal. A deal for power. The terms were not as favorable for me as they seemed at first. The reason for my wish for power, my goal, isn't reachable anymore, has not been since a very long time ago. The terms of the deal state that I have to follow the goal of the one who defeats me in case I lose my own goal. Thus my pledge to you."[NEWLINE]"Why should I trust you?"[NEWLINE]"You don't need to. Just send me into the next fray you and your armies will inevitable be part of and if I die, maybe my next owner will have more use of me."</English>

        <German>"Das ... Ich... wo bin ich? Was ist passiert?"[NEWLINE]Sie machte den Versuch, sich umzusehen, noch immer leicht schwindelig von den Ereignissen, und erkannte, dass sie an eine Wand gekettet war. Der Raum schien eine kleine Gef&#228;gniszelle zu sein. Ein Bewaffneter blickte auf sie herab.[NEWLINE]"Du warst tot und ... hast entschieden, ins Leben zur&#252;ckzukommen. Zumindest habe ich ziemlich gr&#252;ndlich daf&#252;r gesorgt, dass du tot warst. Obwohl bei dir das Sterben nicht wirklich lange anzuhalten scheint."[NEWLINE]"Ich bin gestorben ... erneut." Die letzten Worte fl&#252;sterte sie, kaum h&#246;rbar.[NEWLINE]"Wart Ihr derjenige, der mich t&#246;tete?"[NEWLINE]"Das war ich."[NEWLINE]Sie machte eine Bewegung und bemerkte, dass der Bewaffnete eine Hand an seine Waffe legte, f&#252;r den Fall, dass sie einen Angriff versuchen sollte. Doch alles, was sie tat, war, in eine knieende K&#246;rperhaltung zu wechseln, sie vor der vor ihr stehenden Person zu verbeugen, soweit es ihr in dieser angeketteten Haltung gelang.[NEWLINE]"Wenn wirklich Ihr derjenige wart, der mich erschlagen hat, dann biete ich Euch und Eurer Sache meine Gefolgschaft an. Selbst wenn Ihr mich nicht wollt, werde ich Euch folgen und Euch mit meinem Leben sch&#252;tzen."[NEWLINE]"Warum?"[NEWLINE]"Ich.... schloss einen Handel. Einen Handel f&#252;r Macht. Die Bedingungen waren nicht ganz so zu meinem Vorteil, wie ich damals dachte. Mein Ziel, der Grund f&#252;r mein Streben nach Macht, ist nicht mehr zu erreichen, schon seit einer sehr langen Zeit nicht mehr. Die Punkte im Vertrag sagen, dass ich denjenigen, der mich besiegt, beim Erreichen seiner Ziele helfen muss, sollte ich das meinige verlieren. Deshalb geh&#246;rt meine Treue Euch."[NEWLINE]"Warum sollte ich dir trauen?"[NEWLINE]"Das braucht Ihr nicht. Schickt mich einfach in die n&#228;chste Auseinandersetzung, an der Ihr und Eure Armeen mit Sicherheit teilhaben werdet. Sollte ich sterben, hat vielleicht mein n&#228;chster Herr mehr Verwendung f&#252;r mich."</German>
