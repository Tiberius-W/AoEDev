		<English>If you're lucky enough to capture three drakes of the same type, use this spell to combine them into a single drake flock unit. Drake flocks are stronger and start with the powerful beast type, but they can also be sacrificed to create an elemental mana source in your city. This spell will not transfer experience or promotions from the other drakes, so make sure you cast it with your strongest drake.</English>
