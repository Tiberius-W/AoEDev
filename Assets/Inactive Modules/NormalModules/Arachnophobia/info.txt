tweaks to archos civ

v1.5
By: @LeastCraft

QoL:
	Fixed help text for Rhagodessa spider promotion.
	Versions of spider variant promotions from Spiderkin trait are now hidden from civilopedia for clarity.
	Updated strategy information for the Archos civilization and the spiders in civilopedia.

New mechanics:
	Archos now accumulate Brood Activity (BA) each turn which you can spend on spider related spells.
	The capital will still spawn spider by chance each turn, and the chance to spawn a spider is proportional to the BA gained on that turn.
	The rate of BA gain and the chance of spider spawn are no longer reduced by the number of spiders owned.
	Automatically spawned spiders do not cost Brood Activity.
	The tier of spider spawned automatically now depends on both the capital population and the BA saved up:
	- If BA < 200 (Dormant), no spider will be spawned.
	- If the capital >= size 1 and BA >= 200 (Astir), Baby Spiders will be spawned.
	- If the capital >= size 6 and BA >= 400 (Restless), Spiders will be spawned.
	- If the capital >= size 11 and BA >= 800 (Thronging), Giant Spiders will be spawned.
	
	Leaders with Spiderkin trait gives the Spiderkin promotion to spawned spiders at capital >= size 9 instead of size 10.

Spells:
	Added new spells which utilize BA:
	- Call Baby Spider: Can be cast by any unit. Can only be cast in a player owned city. Consumes 25 BA to summon a Baby Spider.
		- Can be used unlimited number of times per turn.
	- Call Spider: Can be cast by any unit. Can only be cast in a player owned city of size >= 6. Consumes 75 BA to summon a Spider.
		- Can be used unlimited number of times per turn.
	- Call Giant Spider: Can be cast by any unit. Can only be cast in a player owned city of size >= 11. Consumes 150 BA to summon a Giant Spider.
		- Can be used unlimited number of times per turn.
	- Diet of Worms: Can be cast by units with Nature I promotion. Can only be cast in a player owned city. Consumes 100 BA to add 4 food and 8 unhealthiness in the city. Lasts until the caster leaves the city.
		- Can only be used once per turn.
	- Psalm for the Swarm: Can be cast by Haruspex. Can only be cast in a player owned city. Increase BA by 50.
		- Can only be used once per turn.
	
	Poison Explosion 1 and 2 now deal poison damage and applies poison with 100% chance.

	Added new spell "Poison Fume": Adds the "Poison Fume" promotion to units within 1 range.
	
Abilities:
	Added new spells which utilize Baby Spiders:
		- Smear Poison: Can be used by any unit except animals and beasts. Sacrifices the weakest Baby Spider to gain Poisoned Blade promotion.
			- Can be used unlimited number of times per turn.
		- Cannibalize: Can be used by Spiders and Giant Spiders. Consumes the weakest Baby Spider in stack to recover 15% health.
			- Can only be used once per turn.
	- Spider Upgrade now requires the caster (Spider) to be >= level 4 and capital to be >= size 11.

Units:

	Textus now additionally allows spiders to build Maze of Webs.
	Greater Venenum changed to to grant access to spell "Poison Fume"
	Added Archosian Worker, a promotion for Archosian Workers that allows them to build Feeding Pen.

Improvements:
