		<English>The Bezeri are an ancient splinter tribe of the Mazatl Civilization. When the cold winds of the Age of Ice fell upon the Bezeri people, they seemed all but doomed to become one of the many obliterated by Mulcarn's new rule; however, help came in the most unlikely of places...

		

Tahhki was out on the seashore again, searching for a pocket of fish or crab holes; this was the ritual he and the other hunters had fallen into after the jungles nearby gave in to the cold. The hunt was not an exciting one, but it would feed his mate and their hatchlings. Seeing movement in the water, he did not hesitate; his spear flew straight and true.

"OW!!" screamed a voice; Tahhki had never known a fish to speak, much less curse. Water gushing up from the waves, a giant toad sat up in the shallows. "MULCARNS DIAMOND HARD FROZEN NIPPLES! WHY DID YOU DO THAT?!" wailed the toadman. Tahhki stammered, unprepared for such a sudden burst of rage. "I'm sorry!" he said. "I thought you were a fish! Are you hurt?" "MY FOOT! SWEET SUCELLUS, THERE'S BLOOD EVERYWHERE...I'M GOING...I'M GOING TO," the Toadman said before fainting face-first into the waves. Tahhki, panicking, rushed over and began pulling the toadman to shore as he yelled to his fellow hunters for help.

Days later the toadman awoke in a muddy hut; glancing down, he noticed his foot was wrapped in an abundance of bandages. Not only that, his arm, leg, fingers, and elbows were bandaged as well. A rustling at the door drew his attention to Tahhki as he entered the hut. "Oh good, you're awake. I've been worried sick!" he said.

The frogman looked up at him. "I know why my foot is bandaged, Agares; I can FEEL why it is, but all this?" he said, waving vaguely at his semi-mummified body. "Ah! Yes! Well! You see! ... You are a mighty being, and we lizardmen are far too small to lift you, so when we needed to help you, we sort of...Dragged... You back to the village, over sand! ...Mostly...A few rocks here or there, and a roll down the sandbank. You know what, not important! We have no trained healers, so the chief suggested we just swaddle anything that looked bloody or bruised purple!" Tahhki stammered out, If a lizard could sweat, this one would be. "My skin tone is purple." the Toad stated flatly. "We ran out of bandages." Tahhki muttered. The Toadman stared blankly, slow, wide blinks, when suddenly he let out a sharp chirping laugh that built and built until the toadman fell to the bed; after many minutes of cackling, he sat back up, wheezing in delight. "Bless you, kind creatures, you are too good for this cruel world. Tell me, what is your story? How did you find yourself on my shores?" He bubbled.

"It is kind of a long story," said Tahhki. "My kind live a very long time indeed, little lizard; I'm sure I have time to hear it all!" And so, the lizardman recounted his tribe's struggles to the stranger, all that they had overcome, and all that they now faced; Tahhki learned the toad's name, Podaltur, a traveling sage from the deep reefs; the two became close, trading stories and grilled fish in Tahhki's little kitchen.

On their third day together, with Tahhkis hatchling bouncing on his knee, the toadman spoke with a serious frown: "Your situation is dire, friend. I wish to offer your village my service. I am a Temachtiani, a guide of sorts. I believe I can show your people a way out of the path of Mulcarn's new hell, a path into the sea. There are vents a mile offshore that spew sediment and ash... But it is warm, and there is food to be caught. I believe you can make a home there... With a little help." Tahhki sat in thoughtful silence, the whoosh of icy gales outside filling the gap in conversation; eventually, he spoke: "I am not the chief of our village; Mr. Podaltur, I have no authority or claim." Tahhki trailed off... "But I think I will follow you, wise Podaltur of the deep reefs, and I will talk to the others; there is a future in your path, a shared future."

The Bezeri would endure the frozen age in the relative comfort of the warm waters, with great glacier sheets blocking the region off from the rest of the sea; they were shielded from the majority of hungry beasts.

As the age of ice came to a close many years later, the Bezeri at first delighted in their rapid expansion into new warming waters, settling dozens of new sea havens, but it would not last; the age of ice had not been kind to the rest of Erebus; all that remained in the frozen oceans were the strongest and most brutal of beings: sea serpents, dragon turtles, and krakens - all found delight in these bite-sized lizardfolk...

Still, they would endure for a time, building tricks and strategies to outwit the monsters - but on the day the Leviathan entered their territory, at the sight of such a beast, they despaired...

Podaltur, who had once guided their ancestors to travel into the sea in the old stories, now would guide them yet again to return to the coast - but not to hide, no, to prepare.</English>

		<English>Bezeri are an amphibious faction of toads and lizardmen. They start on land with everyone else, and starting at any of the following tech:[LINK=TECH_FERAL_BOND]Feral Bond[\LINK], [LINK=TECH_SORCERY]Sorcery[\LINK], [LINK=TECH_FANATICISM]Fanaticism[\LINK], [LINK=TECH_IRON_WORKING]Iron Working[\LINK], [LINK=TECH_BOWYERS]Bowyers[\LINK], [LINK=TECH_STIRRUPS]Stirrups[\LINK], [LINK=TECH_ASTRONOMY]Astronomy[\LINK] the Bezeri are able to establish fully aquatic cities.

Strategy: 

[ICON_BULLET] The Bezeri are all born with water walking; this allows them to explore the seas immediately (though they are small fish in a big hungry ocean).
[ICON_BULLET] The Bezeri [LINK=UNIT_WORKER_LIZARD_BEZERI]Shoreshaper[\LINK] is able to work land AND sea tiles, as well as build trails, build [LINK=IMPROVEMENT_HUNTING_REEF]hunting reefs[\LINK], build [LINK=IMPROVEMENT_CORAL_FORT]coral fortresses[\LINK] and grow kelp with [LINK=TECH_WAY_OF_THE_FORESTS]Fellowship of Leaves[\LINK]
[ICON_BULLET] The Tlacamichini, or [LINK=UNIT_SHARK_HUNTER]'Shark Hunters'[\LINK], are the archery line for the Bezeri; they are unusual as they start with Blitz, high base movement, and can use ranged attacks repeatedly before attacking; however, these strengths come at the cost of being vulnerable on defense.
[ICON_BULLET] The Temachtiani, [LINK=UNIT_TIDECALLER]Tidecallers[\LINK] as landwalkers call them, are the guides and elders of the Bezeri, and they are your extremely powerful adept line, starting with twincasting at level 1. however, they have a national limit of 12 adepts, 8 mages, 4 archmages. Unique spells are listed on their Civpedia page.
[ICON_BULLET] The Bezeri are expert traders, able to squeeze every drop of value out of every deal; their palace as well as their barter houses all give value to your trade routes.
[ICON_BULLET] The Bezeri have little use for cargo transport; instead, their naval line is comprised of domesticated sea beasts bred at the [LINK=BUILDING_FEEDING_GROUNDS]Feeding Grounds[\LINK] unique building.
[ICON_BULLET] The Bezeri world spell [LINK=SPELL_DROWNING_WAVES]Drowning Waves[\LINK] is able to sink their lands under the sea, destroying resources and improvements, but potentially saving them from an invading army.
[ICON_BULLET] The Bezeri are not able to build the heron throne, but you could steal it!
[ICON_BULLET] The Bezeri lost their homes and fled to the land because of the [LINK=UNIT_LEVIATHAN]Leviathan[\LINK], a nightmarish beast that roams the oceans of Erebus. Seek your revenge and slay the beast! Only then will you earn the right to be the [LINK=TRAIT_CONQUERORSOFTHESEA2]rulers of the deep[\LINK].</English>

		<English>The toad sages of the Bezeri are known as Temachtiani, or simply 'guides.' They hold no authority or power over the lizardfolk and would never claim otherwise; they view the sharing of wisdom as a sacred duty and will share with all who will listen, even landwalkers. Mostly this effort is wasted, however, as when the common folk of Erebus see a gigantic toad beast lurch out of the shallows, they run screaming for the hills, fearing a drowned or worse. The Bezeri Lizardkin, however, hang on the Temachtiani's every word, raised from a young age on stories of how these kindly toads guided their ancestors to the places they now call home. Whenever a new settlement is founded, a Temachtiani is always there to help survey the land and, as the Bezeri believe, bless the occasion.

When they are not currently needed elsewhere, the Temachtiani like to gather in huts, exchanging new tidbits of lore and discoveries to help better serve the peoples of Erebus; at least, that is the intention anyway.	</English>

		<English>Shark Hunters are an all-in aggressive unit, very out of place for the usual archer defensive playstyle-if you sit a Shark Hunter on a hill and try to hold it like a regular archer, they will die almost instantly.

With their base 2 movement and poison weapons, they are much better suited to hit-and-run tactics, dodging between the land and sea to evade counterattacks. Because of this, they benefit a lot from Mobility 1 and 2 when you unlock horseback riding.

On top of that, they also are able to use the rare interaction of Blitz and ranged attacks, allowing you to fire multiple times per turn and then attack in!

Another tactic is to use them as the artillery line for a traditional army, guardsmen promoted spearmen keeping thieves and assassins at bay as they whittle down defenders with high ranged damage.

You may also use your Body 1 mages to boost their movement even further.

Shark hunters have a high 35% damage cap on ranged damage, and Serpent hunters cap at 60%! This can bring even the chunkiest kraken into strike range if you bring enough firepower.

		<English>Deep beneath the waves no light nor sound breaks the oppressive stillness. The hunt was on. Long had Skaa'ral and his men waited and watched this beast and now was their chance. As the rest of the hunters look on, Skaa'ral waves them off and enters the submerged cave alone, armed only with a mithril javalin he had stolen on a surface raid mere days before.

As the hours pass, hope fades and the group is forced to reflect on the circumstances that brought them here. Many recall the massive beast that time and time again defeated the defenses of even the mighty Bezer'ej itself to rob it's supplies. Others recall the voice of Skaa'raj with his call to arms to remove the threat.

After half a day most have given up hope of their leaders return, and the group prepares to return to the city to mourn their loss. Yet even as they turn to leave, Skaa'raj emerges from the cave... but not alone.

Covered in wounds that still flow freely, Skaa'raj does not swim, but rides triumphantly from the cave mouth mounted on a sea serpent that would give even the great leviathan pause.

As Skaa'raj gives the signal to go home, only one of the group notices that the beast seems strangly subdued and responds to commands as if trained from birth to do so... As they turn for home once again he wonders what could possibly have occured in the cave...

		<English>[DANGER, QUICKSAVE BEFORE USE, EXPERIMENTAL!]

The Bezeri world spell is an emergency defensive action; when activated, it will cause all land tiles to sink one level (besides cities) inside Bezeri cultural control, from peaks to hills, hills to plains, plains to coast.

This will destroy all improvements and resources on land, drowning anyone and anything that cannot swim or fly.

		

This will nuke your economy, but it can be rebuilt with the hunting reef improvement to gain new resources and the grow kelp spell from [Fellowship of Leaves].

As many negatives as this may have, the act of wiping out your attackers force in one turn and making your cities unreachable without boats is something that will turn the tide of any war.
