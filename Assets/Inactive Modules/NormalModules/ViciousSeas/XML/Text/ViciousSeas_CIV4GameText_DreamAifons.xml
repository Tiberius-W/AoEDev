		<English>The great day has come!
The promised children of Danalin have returned to us, in splendour and wreathed in gold!
With grace and ease, they welcome us into their homes, the warm air blowing the scent of a feast through the door!
With generosity and patience, they share the wealth of their great markets, overflowing with riches!
With wisdom and kindness, they study in their marbled halls, slick with dripping black wax!
With faith and diligence, they push back the darkness of your doubts and whispering thoughts!
With strength and fervour, they peel the skin from your face, claws alight with shining blood!
With rictus grins and toothless maws, they chase you down the halls of your childhood fears!
The great day has come! Run and hide!


The Dreaming: 

This Entity is an anomaly in Erebus; it is not malignant or particularly intelligent, it only has a base cunning and singular desire: It wants to become real. 
To do this, it needs others to acknowledge it and express a belief that it is a tangible thing. Only then can it accumulate more reality into itself.

The Dreaming is a byproduct of Danalins' unnatural slumber, much like ringing in the ears is a byproduct of sound.
Hastur - Danalins' tormentor - Has cultivated this byproduct into a living thing, and as it does not have a realness to itself yet, was able to slip through the corners and enter Erebus without invitation.

Mortal souls, especially ones with great force of will, find themselves able to easily alter the state of the Dreaming - even destroy it, if that is their wish. 
However, the entity can feed off this kind of attention; a strong-willed mage may lay waste to the Dreaming, but what remains will be even more real, and the mage will have unknowingly helped make matters worse.

What the final results would be of the Dreaming becoming 'real' is something of an untested theory; perhaps reality and the Dreaming would merge. Or perhaps it would cause the gap between Danalin and the waking world to rupture, causing the sleeping god to break the compact and trigger a catastrophe.

Little Nightmares:

These are the cast-offs, the shavings, the cutting room floor debris of Danalins' shifting imagination - the pieces of dream not interesting or poignant enough to be reused or remembered in further dreams.
Unwanted and unmissed, these broken toys, barely real, found an escape through the gap left by the Dreamings' departure to Erebus.

In Erebus, these rejects were confronted by beings who were whole, who were wanted, who had purpose.
And they felt hatred.


Symbiosis:

The Dreaming wants to become real, and the Little Nightmares need to become whole.
The Dreaming needs actors to convince the denizens of Erebus into believing, and the Little Nightmares gain a form, a voice and a purpose in serving as barmaids, children, soldiers, whatever is imagined of them. 
But while the Dreaming does these things purely out of instinct, the Little Nightmares are still thinking, feeling creatures; behind the charming barmaid's warm smile, cold malice lurks.

Danger: 

If a person were to travel through the Dreaming without acknowledging or noticing the entity, they could reach nearly to the other side without harm.
This is harder than it sounds. Simply marching in and loudly exclaiming that none of this is real is still treating the entity as something substantial enough to confront - and once that happens, the Dreaming has no further use for them, and the actors have no reason to keep pretending.
Only true ambivalence will protect visitors, assuming they understand they need to leave as fast as casually possible and then break into a mad dash once the exit is in sight.

Ecology:

As the Dreaming syphons more and more reality into itself, living things inside of it start to break down; flowers wilt, stones crumble, and flesh sloughs off bone.</English>
