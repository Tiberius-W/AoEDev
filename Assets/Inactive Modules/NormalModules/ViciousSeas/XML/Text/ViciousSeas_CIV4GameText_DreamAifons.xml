		<English>The great day has come!
The promised children of Danalin have returned to us, in splendour and wreathed in gold!
With grace and ease, they welcome us into their homes, the warm air blowing the scent of a feast through the door!
With generosity and patience, they share the wealth of their great markets, overflowing with riches!
With wisdom and kindness, they study in their marbled halls, slick with dripping black wax!
With faith and diligence, they push back the darkness of your doubts and whispering thoughts!
With strength and fervour, they peel the skin from your face, claws alight with shining blood!
With rictus grins and toothless maws, they chase you down the halls of your childhood fears!
The great day has come! Run and hide!


The Dreaming: 

This Entity is an anomaly in Erebus; it is not malignant or particularly intelligent, it only has a base cunning and singular desire: It wants to become real. 
To do this, it needs others to acknowledge it and express a belief that it is a tangible thing. Only then can it accumulate more reality into itself.

The Dreaming is a byproduct of Danalins' unnatural slumber, much like ringing in the ears is a byproduct of sound.
Hastur - Danalins' tormentor - Has cultivated this byproduct into a living thing, and as it does not have a realness to itself yet, was able to slip through the corners and enter Erebus without invitation.

Mortal souls, especially ones with great force of will, find themselves able to easily alter the state of the Dreaming - even destroy it, if that is their wish. 
However, the entity can feed off this kind of attention; a strong-willed mage may lay waste to the Dreaming, but what remains will be even more real, and the mage will have unknowingly helped make matters worse.

What the final results would be of the Dreaming becoming 'real' is something of an untested theory; perhaps reality and the Dreaming would merge. Or perhaps it would cause the gap between Danalin and the waking world to rupture, causing the sleeping god to break the compact and trigger a catastrophe.

Little Nightmares:

These are the cast-offs, the shavings, the cutting room floor debris of Danalins' shifting imagination - the pieces of dream not interesting or poignant enough to be reused or remembered in further dreams.
Unwanted and unmissed, these broken toys, barely real, found an escape through the gap left by the Dreamings' departure to Erebus.

In Erebus, these rejects were confronted by beings who were whole, who were wanted, who had purpose.
And they felt hatred.


Symbiosis:

The Dreaming wants to become real, and the Little Nightmares need to become whole.
The Dreaming needs actors to convince the denizens of Erebus into believing, and the Little Nightmares gain a form, a voice and a purpose in serving as barmaids, children, soldiers, whatever is imagined of them. 
But while the Dreaming does these things purely out of instinct, the Little Nightmares are still thinking, feeling creatures; behind the charming barmaid's warm smile, cold malice lurks.

Danger: 

If a person were to travel through the Dreaming without acknowledging or noticing the entity, they could reach nearly to the other side without harm.
This is harder than it sounds. Simply marching in and loudly exclaiming that none of this is real is still treating the entity as something substantial enough to confront - and once that happens, the Dreaming has no further use for them, and the actors have no reason to keep pretending.
Only true ambivalence will protect visitors, assuming they understand they need to leave as fast as casually possible and then break into a mad dash once the exit is in sight.

Ecology:

As the Dreaming syphons more and more reality into itself, living things inside of it start to break down; flowers wilt, stones crumble, and flesh sloughs off bone.</English>

[ICON_BULLET]The Dream Aifons appear as hidden nationality monsters outside of their cultural borders, and angelic beings who inject culture in nearby neutral or hostile cities when inside their own borders.
This means the only way they can capture a city is by culture flipping it!
[ICON_BULLET]Dream cities have terrible hammer production, especially if settled in the open ocean. Instead, they start with the unique civic [LINK=CIVIC_MELDING]Melding[\LINK], allowing them to convert their culture into production for completing units or structures.
[ICON_BULLET]Dream cities are limited in population, to grow larger they will need to build their unique buildings, strengthening the Dreamings' hold on the region.
[ICON_BULLET]Being born of Danalin's troubled dreams, these false Aifons are able to settle cities on the ocean and have better yields there than on land.
[ICON_BULLET]The Dreaming terrain type spreads inside their culture, giving them a defensive bonus inside of it and slightly hurting other units. It can be dispelled with Metamagic, leaving the cities exposed as the nightmarish wasteland they are.
[ICON_BULLET]The Dreaming terrain also saps the life of the normal terrain around it, spreading wasteland, not that those caught in the Dreaming would be able to see it for what it really is.
[ICON_BULLET]Crime is your biggest enemy: losing control of crime in a dreaming city is extremely dangerous and will quickly lead to a total collapse of the dream. Especially with each [LINK=BUILDING_NIGHTMARES]Population point[\LINK] producing extra crime.
[ICON_BULLET]The Dream of the Aifons have access to a unique version of the Alter of Luonnotar, strengthening the city it is built in, giving XP to disciple units, and providing units with the [LINK=PROMOTION_DOOMGIVER]Doomgiver[\LINK] promotion.
[ICON_BULLET]The Dream Aifons do not have arcane units besides Hemah. Instead, they get the insatiable Empty, a disciple mimic unit who is unable to gain experience from combat but can steal promotions, including spellcasting.</English>

		<English>Condatis heard the sound of waves.

Not small waves, not ripples on the shoreline hissing onto the sand.
No, this was the great crashing boom of water smashing into a lighthouse on a storm-swept isle, grand and terrible.

She always heard the ocean, whether or not she was anywhere near the coast; it was always there - sometimes close, sometimes far, but ever present.
Condatis had noticed that whenever the waves grew louder, her husband would seem to find urgent missions for her, far from the sea, and the sound of waves grew distant.

Then, a change; the sound of waves began to come not from the sea, but from across the land, and as they grew louder, Hastur's missions would come more frequently and send her farther and farther away.
But still, the sound of waves grew louder, as if they were drawn to Condatis.


Now the waves roared in her ears; whatever it was, it had found her!
She drew her weapon and fell into a battle stance - Whatever it was, it would not harm her beloved Hastur!
She dove around the corner and faced... herself?
The women stared at her with wide eyes... and then lunged with weapons drawn!
Condatis raised her own to meet them as the sound of waves crashed around her.

"You dare to take my form, dreamling!?" they said in unison.

Back-and-forth blows were traded, strikes that shattered marble floors and crumbled statues, as the duo continued their frightful dance.

"Too strong to be a dream! ...What are you??" Echoed the warriors.

Condatis leapt over the great dining table, as it was smashed to floatsam behind her, and counter-attacked with a surging wall of water that swept everything in the stone halls away.

All except this stranger, unmoved and glowering up at her.

"ENOUGH!" The combined roar blew out the dining hall windows as the angels both unfurled their wings, blasting out their full radiance.
Condatis held for a moment, but then she was swept up in the surging tide and flung into the wall behind her.

Everything was cloudy as Condatis struggled to gasp air back into her lungs and regain her footing.
When she looked up, the stranger was uncomfortably close to her face, as if to inspect a piece of craftsmanship.
"You are a fraud," The stranger said with bemusement, "But a mere mimic would not be able to do THAT. There is something more at work here."

As if on cue, Hastur the Lord of Nightmares came bursting into the hall's entranceway. 
"CONDATIS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING... In... here?" Hastur started with a snarl that quickly trailed off, his gaze going from one Condatis to the other.

The stranger looked back at her and then at Hastur.
"Oh... So this is how you handle rejection, 'dear husband'?" The woman spat the last word out like a curse, "You know, you're supposed to find someone who looks like me, not a literal copy, you perverse creature!"

As the stranger poised to strike, Condatis dove in front to deflect the blow, crying out: "I am Condatis! Archangel of the Seas, and you will not harm my husband!"

"Maybe you are of me, perhaps a fragment, no doubt stolen,"  said her mirror, glaring towards Hastur pointedly, "But that is not your husband; that has not been your husband for a very long time, sister of my soul. That is a traitor, and our enemy!"

Condatis stood stunned as the angel's words caused a flood of suppressed memories to wash over her, like a burst dam; all the little barbed words, all the demeaning moments, and all the brutal beatings...
Hearing this reflection say all the things she wished to say to her husband, and with all the strength and confidence she dreamt of having while saying it.

A key turned, a lock is opened, Condatis turned her face towards her husband, eyes aglow with a terrible wrath.

One Condatis was a battle worthy of song, two Condatis is a sick joke by The One, thought Hastur, and he immediately tore a hole in reality, diving through it to escape.</English>

I lead the fight against Oghma's forces, who have invaded Danalin's vault while he sleeps...

My beloved husband is Hastur, Lord of Inspiration, Archangel of Mammon, and my guiding light...
...No... Who am...



Together, we created the Euphoria, a realm that rivals those created by the gods. It is the realm of dreams, where our children, the Aifons, grow and play. Sometimes my children leave the dreaming to go on adventures, returning later to recuperate from all the stress of the waking world. It is ruled by my husband, and I as their dutiful queen...
...So many teeth... Little beasts...Get away!



I follow the kind word of Danalin, He Who Drowns. I lead the sermons every dreamwake, as we offer up the youngest to the dark pools...
...A dashing sailor... ....Far away... ...This cant...I must...

Still,  a Dreamling the size of a small hillgiant serves as a useful deterrent.</English>

		<English>Condatis heard the sound of waves.

Not small waves, not ripples on the shoreline hissing onto the sand.
No, this was the great crashing boom of water smashing into a lighthouse on a storm-swept isle, grand and terrible.

She always heard the ocean, whether or not she was anywhere near the coast; it was always there - sometimes close, sometimes far, but ever present.
Condatis had noticed that whenever the waves grew louder, her husband would seem to find urgent missions for her, far from the sea, and the sound of waves grew distant.

Then, a change; the sound of waves began to come not from the sea, but from across the land, and as they grew louder, Hastur's missions would come more frequently and send her farther and farther away.
But still, the sound of waves grew louder, as if they were drawn to Condatis.


Now the waves roared in her ears; whatever it was, it had found her!
She drew her weapon and fell into a battle stance - Whatever it was, it would not harm her beloved Hastur!
She dove around the corner and faced... herself?
The women stared at her with wide eyes... and then lunged with weapons drawn!
Condatis raised her own to meet them as the sound of waves crashed around her.

"You dare to take my form, dreamling!?" they said in unison.

Back-and-forth blows were traded, strikes that shattered marble floors and crumbled statues, as the duo continued their frightful dance.

"Too strong to be a dream! ...What are you??" Echoed the warriors.

Condatis leapt over the great dining table, as it was smashed to floatsam behind her, and counter-attacked with a surging wall of water that swept everything in the stone halls away.

All except this stranger, unmoved and glowering up at her.

"ENOUGH!" The combined roar blew out the dining hall windows as the angels both unfurled their wings, blasting out their full radiance.
Condatis held for a moment, but then she was swept up in the surging tide and flung into the wall behind her.

Everything was cloudy as Condatis struggled to gasp air back into her lungs and regain her footing.
When she looked up, the stranger was uncomfortably close to her face, as if to inspect a piece of craftsmanship.
"You are a fraud," The stranger said with bemusement, "But a mere mimic would not be able to do THAT. There is something more at work here."

As if on cue, Hastur the Lord of Nightmares came bursting into the hall's entranceway. 
"CONDATIS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING... In... here?" Hastur started with a snarl that quickly trailed off, his gaze going from one Condatis to the other.

The stranger looked back at her and then at Hastur.
"Oh... So this is how you handle rejection, 'dear husband'?" The woman spat the last word out like a curse, "You know, you're supposed to find someone who looks like me, not a literal copy, you perverse creature!"

As the stranger poised to strike, Condatis dove in front to deflect the blow, crying out: "I am Condatis! Archangel of the Seas, and you will not harm my husband!"

"Maybe you are of me, perhaps a fragment, no doubt stolen,"  said her mirror, glaring towards Hastur pointedly, "But that is not your husband; that has not been your husband for a very long time, sister of my soul. That is a traitor, and our enemy!"

Condatis stood stunned as the angel's words caused a flood of suppressed memories to wash over her, like a burst dam; all the little barbed words, all the demeaning moments, and all the brutal beatings...
Hearing this reflection say all the things she wished to say to her husband, and with all the strength and confidence she dreamt of having while saying it.

A key turned, a lock is opened, Condatis turned her face towards her husband, eyes aglow with a terrible wrath.

One Condatis was a battle worthy of song, two Condatis is a sick joke by The One, thought Hastur, and he immediately tore a hole in reality, diving through it to escape.</English>

Back-and-forth blows were traded, strikes that shattered marble floors and crumbled statues, as the duo continued their frightful dance.

"Too strong to be a dream! ...What are you??" Echoed the warriors.

Condatis leapt over the great dining table, as it was smashed to floatsam behind her, and counter-attacked with a surging wall of water that swept everything in the stone halls away.

All except this stranger, unmoved and glowering up at her.

"ENOUGH!" The combined roar blew out the dining hall windows as the angels both unfurled their wings, blasting out their full radiance.
Condatis held for a moment, but then she was swept up in the surging tide and flung into the wall behind her.

Everything was cloudy as Condatis struggled to gasp air back into her lungs and regain her footing.
When she looked up, the stranger was uncomfortably close to her face, as if to inspect a piece of craftsmanship.
"You are a fraud," The stranger said with bemusement, "But a mere mimic would not be able to do THAT. There is something more at work here."

As if on cue, Hastur the Lord of Nightmares came bursting into the hall's entranceway. 
"CONDATIS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING... In... here?" Hastur started with a snarl that quickly trailed off, his gaze going from one Condatis to the other.

The stranger looked back at her and then at Hastur.
"Oh... So this is how you handle rejection, 'dear husband'?" The woman spat the last word out like a curse, "You know, you're supposed to find someone who looks like me, not a literal copy, you perverse creature!"

As the stranger poised to strike, Condatis dove in front to deflect the blow, crying out: "I am Condatis! Archangel of the Seas, and you will not harm my husband!"

"Maybe you are of me, perhaps a fragment, no doubt stolen,"  said her mirror, glaring towards Hastur pointedly, "But that is not your husband; that has not been your husband for a very long time, sister of my soul. That is a traitor, and our enemy!"

Condatis stood stunned as the angel's words caused a flood of suppressed memories to wash over her, like a burst dam; all the little barbed words, all the demeaning moments, and all the brutal beatings...
Hearing this reflection say all the things she wished to say to her husband, and with all the strength and confidence she dreamt of having while saying it.

A key turned, a lock is opened, Condatis turned her face towards her husband, eyes aglow with a terrible wrath.

One Condatis was a battle worthy of song, two Condatis is a sick joke by The One, thought Hastur, and he immediately tore a hole in reality, diving through it to escape.</Italian>
		<Spanish>Condatis heard the sound of waves.

Not small waves, not ripples on the shoreline hissing onto the sand.
No, this was the great crashing boom of water smashing into a lighthouse on a storm-swept isle, grand and terrible.

She always heard the ocean, whether or not she was anywhere near the coast; it was always there - sometimes close, sometimes far, but ever present.
Condatis had noticed that whenever the waves grew louder, her husband would seem to find urgent missions for her, far from the sea, and the sound of waves grew distant.

Then, a change; the sound of waves began to come not from the sea, but from across the land, and as they grew louder, Hastur's missions would come more frequently and send her farther and farther away.
But still, the sound of waves grew louder, as if they were drawn to Condatis.


Now the waves roared in her ears; whatever it was, it had found her!
She drew her weapon and fell into a battle stance - Whatever it was, it would not harm her beloved Hastur!
She dove around the corner and faced... herself?
The women stared at her with wide eyes... and then lunged with weapons drawn!
Condatis raised her own to meet them as the sound of waves crashed around her.

		<English>Condatis struggled under the crushing weight of yet another of her dear husband's tasks.

It did not seem to matter how she performed in her last mission; the next was always even more crushing, and her beloveds' glare grew more disapproving by the day.



hardly able to speak, barely able to think, the very will to live held on only by the ever pressing need to meet Hastur's eyes and find approval... No matter the cost.



Suddenly, she stumbled over something, crashing into the floor with a cry of pain.



"Pathetic." Snarled Hastur.



As she stumbled to her feet, she noticed what had caused her to lose her balance, wedged between the rocks was a smooth, simple mask.

If she were of a clearer mind, she might have sworn she heard a voice barely whispering, "Go on, child, put it on, and let's have some fun."



As she placed the mask over her nose, Hastur's unflinching gaze drifted over and past her, as if she suddenly never existed. And then a weight she didn't know she had was... lifted over her. 

Condatis exhaled for what might be the first time in her memory. For the first time, she felt... free.



Every waking moment had been spent focusing on her husband, and only now did she see herself...

She was Condatis! Archangel of the Seas, veteran of the godswar, protector of the Vault of Danalin!

Who the fuck did he think he was to make her grovel?!



Hastur suddenly felt his hair stand on end, every inch of the palace hall thrumming with pure energy. 

Sensing doom, the Lord of Nightmare immediately tore a hole in creation and slipped through.

A moment later, the sky boomed with a defening bellow; "ENOUGH!"

The Palace, a monument to Hastur's oppression, exploded in a shockwave of dark-stained mother of pearl.</English>
