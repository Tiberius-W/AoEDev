		<English>Unlike most other religions, the Overlords are not content simply working or co-habilitating with the state that houses their cults. Far more fanatical than a typical theocracy, a polity ruled by a Slumbering Coven sees a chosen cult's cultists and Speakers embedded on even the highest echelons of government, and their influence is felt far and wide - a populace whipped into a frenzy through mad preaching find themselves much more willing to continue fighting.

Key to a Slumbering Coven is a group of seven Dreamers - the finest and most valued of the ruling cult. While conveying contradictory messages most of the time, every now and then, they speak in unison, and the Speakers are wise to heed their commands.

Such governance, however, comes with severe repercussions beyond the obvious mercuriality of the Dreamers: the priestly class is the only one that can thrive in such an irrational regime, with trades demanding clear thinking finding themselves utterly stifled by the environment. But at least the bounties of the sea will be given priority, helping fishermen make a very safe, very good living out of such.</English>

"The coordinates we got from the Lanun have been way off; I don't see the mainland anywhere!" said the first sailor. 

"Nonsense, they have no reason to mislead us; our gold was as good as anyone's, see? Those islands ahead mean land must be just behind them!" said the second.

"Do you call that land?? There is not a single living thing on those ridges besides barnacles and... and..." said the first sailor, trailing off.

The first sailor's face started to go a funny shade of purple and green.

"What the hell has gotten into you?" said the second sailor.

"T-That island just blinked at me!" said the first.

Suddenly the waves around The Marionette exploded into froth and roil as the ship started to lift up into the air, stranded on the flipper of a megalithic beast from nightmare.

"THOSE BASTARDS SET US-" The second sailor's words were cut off as the ship pitched violently, a deafening roar filling the skies, causing every board in the vessel to vibrate. Tumbling out of the crow's nest, all the second sailor could do was watch helplessly as the roil rushed up to meet him.
