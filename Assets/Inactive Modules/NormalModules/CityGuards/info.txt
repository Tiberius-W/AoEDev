Small mod to make cities start with a guarding warrior (held) with the Despotism civic. Will give an archer/longbowman with the appropriate tech.
Afterall, a good ruler needs to make sure his citizens know who is in charge.

Idea came from being overrun a few too many games starting out with Ljosalfar.
Also, gies Despotism ever so slightly more use than just something to change at the first alternative.

1.1 Updates: 
Checks to prevent issues if civilization doesn't have the unit (Aka Khazad and longbowmen) - Thanks to T_W for the feedback. 
Also, adjusting the default unit for D'Tesh.

1.2 Updates:
Standardizing all built in civilization palace to give 20% city defense for capital if less than 20%. Notably, Dtesh is an exception with their 50%.

1.3 Updates:
Changing Held to Leash 1 so that city guards can use abilities/ranged attack or even do an "offensive-defense".
Updated description of DESPOTISM so people know that the guards come from this civic.

1.4 Updates:
Adding defensive melee units to the list of possibilities.
