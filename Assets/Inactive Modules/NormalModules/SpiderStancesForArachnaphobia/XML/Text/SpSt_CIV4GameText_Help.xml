		<English>After defeating (and eating) a living unit in battle, baby spider gains the [LINK=PROMOTION_GROWTH_SPURTS]Growth spurts[\LINK] promotion, transforming it into an [LINK=UNIT_SPIDER]adult spider[\LINK] with a probability of 20% per turn. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Baby Spiders are very weak individually, but the Archos civilization can make use of them by [LINK=SPELL_SMEAR_POISON]sacrificing[\LINK] them for poisoned weapons or [LINK=SPELL_CANNIBALIZE]feeding[\LINK] them to bigger spiders for healing. [NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Additionally, baby spiders grow stronger when large numbers of them are grouped together, gaining one stack of the [LINK=PROMOTION_SWARMING1]Swarming[\LINK] promotion for every 10 baby spiders in the same tile, up to 4 stacks. At [LINK=PROMOTION_SWARMING4]Swarming IV[\LINK] with 40 baby spiders, they gain the ability to target the weakest unit in a stack.
		[NEWLINE]Spiders can swap between two modes while in your borders. Hunting mode (starts enabled) grants stealth 1, hidden nationality, and prevents receiving defensive bonuses. Territorial mode removes stealth and hidden nationality, but allows defensive bonuses.</English>
