Fixed Grigori Refugees only being able to upgrade into workers.

Merged 'Luchuirp Worker' and 'Refugee Worker' Modules
Added Geomancer UU, an Amurite worker UU that can build Mana Nodes

Refugee Worker 0.10 - 9 Mar '11
Allows the Grigori Refugee unit to upgrade into workers. This allows players to take advantage of racial promotions

Luchuirp Worker 0.11 - 11 Mar '11
Fixed a bug where it wasn't appearing on the Mud Golem.

Luchuirp Worker 0.10 - 9 Mar '11
The Luchuirp's 'pedia entry says Kilmorph taught them what they forgot, and let them live in the caves.
So this lets them continue to remember what Kilmorph taught them, and build the Dwarven Mines just like the Khazad.
